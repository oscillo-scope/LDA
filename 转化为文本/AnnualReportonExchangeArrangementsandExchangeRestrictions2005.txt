Not for Redistribution PREFACE The Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions has been published by the IMF since 1950. It draws on information available to the IMF from a number of sources, including that pro- vided in the course of official staff visits to member countries, and has been prepared in close consultation with national authorities. The information is presented in a tabular format. This project was coordinated in the Monetary and Financial Systems Department by a staff team directed by Udaibir S. Das and comprising Judit Vadasz, Roy C. Baban, Jahanara Zaman, Harald Anderson, and Maria Zenaida de Mesa. It draws on the specialized contribution of that department (for specific countries), with assistance from staff members of the IMF’s five area departments, together with staff of other departments. The report was edited by Gail Berre and Esha Ray of the External Relations Department and produced by Mrs. de Mesa and the IMF Multimedia Services Division. ix ©International Monetary Fund.

Not for Redistribution INTRODUCTION This edition (the fifty-sixth issue) of the Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions provides a description of the foreign exchange arrangements, exchange and trade restrictions, and, to a limited extent, prudential measures of individual IMF member countries.1 The 2005 edition further attempts to describe exchange and trade systems in their entirety, going beyond simply those aspects involving exchange restrictions or exchange controls. 2, 3 Overall Developments This report highlights a continuing trend toward the easing of controls in all areas covered by the yearbook. Very few countries introduced new controls or limitations on foreign exchange transactions during 2004. Major trends and significant overall developments documented in this report are the following: (cid:120) (cid:120) (cid:120) (cid:120) Six countries accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement. Changes in exchange rate regimes and exchange arrangements indicated a move toward more flexible exchange rate regimes by several countries and regional developments in several West African and European countries resulting from their entry into currency unions and/or accession to the European Union. The general thrust of changes affecting the regulatory framework of foreign exchange transactions was toward the easing of controls in the areas of resident and nonresident accounts, and current and capital account transactions. Changes in the prudential measures of many countries were also directed toward the easing of requirements.4 1 In addition to the 184 IMF members, the report includes Hong Kong SAR, as well as Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles, for which the Kingdom of the Netherlands has accepted the IMF Articles of Agreement. 2 Excluding the import tariff structure. 3 In general, the descriptions relate to the exchange and trade systems as of end-2004, but, in some cases, reference is made to significant developments that occurred through end-July 2005. As in previous reports, questions of definition and jurisdiction are not covered. 4 The report covers only foreign exchange–related prudential regulations; hence, prudential measures that do not differentiate between domestic currency and foreign exchange and/or residents and nonresidents are not dealt with. (cid:120) There was a significant increase in notifications to the IMF involving the enforcement of restrictions for security reasons. These restrictions were introduced as a result of the emphasis on preventing the financing of terrorism.5 The sections below highlight developments in the major areas covered in this edition. Details of the exchange arrangements and regulatory frameworks for current and capital transactions in member countries are available in the individual country chapters. Developments in Exchange Arrangements The exchange arrangements maintained by members are classified into eight categories.6 These categories are based on the flexibility of the arrangement and how it operates in practice—i.e., the de facto regime is described instead of simply following the de jure or official description of the arrangement. Definitions of the individual categories are described in detail in the Compilation Guide. From data presented in Table 1, two major trends can be observed: (cid:120) (cid:120) A move toward more flexible exchange rate regimes. The operations of the exchange rate systems of Botswana, Dominican Republic, Guinea, Israel, Romania, Suriname, and Zimbabwe became more flexible, while those of Guatemala, Honduras, and Trinidad and Tobago moved in the other direction. Recent moves by China and Malaysia also reflect the trend toward more flexible exchange rate regimes (although no reclassification has been made as yet for either country). Changes made by countries in accordance with membership in multilateral or regional agreements. On regional trends, four European countries (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Slovenia) adopted the ERM II in the context of their accession to the European Union. At the same time, two countries in West Africa 5 Twenty-three countries notified the IMF of restrictions they had imposed, and only two countries lifted such restrictions. 6 The categories comprise: (1) exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender, (2) currency board arrangement, (3) conventional pegged arrangement, (4) pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands, (5) crawling peg, (6) crawling bands, (7) managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate, and (8) independently floating. 1 ©International Monetary Fund.

Changes in the exchange arrangements not related to elements of the exchange rate regime used for classification (Table 2) were mostly directed toward the easing of controls, with 14 measures pointing in this direction against 8 that could be viewed as having become more restrictive. The measures are summarized below: (cid:120) (cid:120) The most notable steps were unifying some of the multiple exchange rates (Syrian Arab Republic and Zimbabwe); unifying markets (Dominican Republic); allowing exchange bureaus to participate in the interbank market (Burundi); eliminating exchange taxes (Cameroon); changing the method of operating the foreign exchange market, including the elimination or reinstatement of the auction system (Burundi, Mexico, and São Tomé and Príncipe); and using a tender instead of direct purchases of foreign exchange (Zimbabwe). The few measures that were directed at increasing constraints consisted of allowing currency swaps and forward exchange transactions only against approved commercial transactions (Bangladesh); and raising the commissions applied for outward transfers (Republic of Congo). In addition, Ukraine introduced the following temporary tightening measures: imposing a fee on purchases of noncash foreign currency, limiting asset transaction volumes and foreign exchange sales by banks, prohibiting the sale of foreign exchange by banks to exchange bureaus, and prohibiting banks from participating in the interbank market if they have not provided information on requests from clients for the purchase of foreign exchange exceeding $100,000 or its equivalent. Acceptance of Article VIII Obligations Six IMF member countries accepted Article VIII obligations during 2004 and the first half of 2005. These include Azerbaijan, Cape Verde, Colombia, Egypt, Islamic Republic of Iran, and Tajikistan. IMF members accepting the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, commit to refrain from imposing restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, and from engaging in discriminatory currency arrangements or multiple currency practices, except with IMF approval. As a result of these developments, out of the IMF’s 184 members, 20 have not yet accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4.7 Regulatory Framework for Foreign Exchange Transactions This section describes the salient features of the changes in a large number of categories, including arrangements for payments and receipts, payments for invisible transactions and current transfers, capital account transactions, and the regulation of resident and nonresident accounts. The measures can be summarized as follows: (cid:120) As in other categories, the general thrust of the measures taken by members in 2004 and 2005 was toward the easing of controls. Only a few countries took steps that were of a restrictive nature (of the 56 countries that notified the IMF of changes in these categories, only 10 moved toward introducing limitations on some transactions). The category in which the most countries moved toward expanding limitations is the regulation of the inflow of foreign direct investments (with five countries moving toward a more restrictive stance). It should be noted, however, that limitations in this category are often motivated by reasons other than economic factors (similar to the regulation of real estate investments by nonresidents). 7 These countries are listed in the Summary Features of Exchange Arrangements. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INTRODUCTION 3 (cid:120) Repatriation and surrender requirements moved less unequivocally toward removal of controls; five countries either introduced or increased repatriation or surrender requirements, while the same number of countries relaxed controls over these transactions. (cid:120) Of several countries that maintained limits on payments and transfers for current account transactions and/or capital movements, 19 either abolished or raised these limits. (cid:120) One country (Russia) introduced unremunerated reserve requirements as a capital control, and linked these requirements to the re-regulation of the foreign exchange accounts of residents and the domestic currency accounts of nonresidents. Provisions for Commercial Banks and Institutional Investors Altogether, out of 52 measures taken, 34 implied the easing of requirements. The most important of these were reductions in reserve requirements for commercial banks; permission to financial institutions to contract external borrowing or to increase the limits on such borrowings; relaxation of the ownership limits applied to nonresidents in nonbank financial institutions; and some easing of controls on unit trust management companies and insurers, allowing them to invest abroad a larger proportion of the assets under their management. Some of the reported changes were made to allow the building of instruments and institutions of prudential oversight and therefore could not be linked directly with the easing or tightening of rules. These include most of the changes to the methods of calculating net open positions of banks, setting of exposure limits to securities, and establishing prescriptions for the way in which technical provisions of insurance companies are determined. Some other measures simply reflect new circumstances, most notably changes in the remuneration of reserves (except when the remuneration was eliminated). PROCEDURAL GUIDE Following a standardized approach, the description of each system is broken down into similar headings, and the coverage for each country includes a final section that lists chronologically the significant changes during 2004 and, in the case of some countries, those that occurred through end-July 2005. The Compilation Guide provides the definitions and methodology used to bring together information under each heading. The report is presented in a tabular format that enhances transparency and uniformity of treatment of information across countries and includes coverage on the regulatory framework for capital transactions. The information serves to update the exchange arrangements and exchange restrictions database maintained by the IMF. The country chapters present an abstract of the relevant information that is available to the IMF. The report also includes a classification table on Exchange Rate Arrangements and Anchors of Monetary Policy. This classification system is based on the information available on the operations of members’ de facto policies, as analyzed by IMF staff, which may differ from countries’ officially announced arrangements. The table on Summary Features of Exchange Arrangements and Regulatory Frameworks for Current and Capital Transactions in Member Countries provides an overview of the characteristics of the exchange and trade systems of IMF member countries. The Country Table Matrix (the Appendix) provides a complete listing of the rubrics used in the database. Listing conventions used in the report are as follows: (cid:120) When it is unclear whether a particular category or measure exists—because pertinent information is not available at the time of publication—the category is displayed with the notation “n.a.” (cid:120) If a measure is known to exist but specific information on it is not available, the category is displayed with the notation “yes.” (cid:120) When information is available on all but a particular item or items within a category, these items are not included in the table. (cid:120) In cases where members have provided the IMF staff with information indicating that a category or an item is not regulated, these are marked by “n.r.” ©International Monetary Fund.

Changes and the Resulting Reclassifications of Exchange Rate Regimes, End-July 2005 Nature of Change Current Status Botswana China, People’s Republic of Dominican Republic Estonia Guatemala Guinea The Bank of Botswana devalued the pula by 12% against the basket of currencies to which it is pegged. Effective July 21, 2005, the renminbi was revalued to RMB 8.11 per US$1 and its exchange rate is to be determined based on an undisclosed basket of currencies. Daily fluctuations in the renminbi-dollar exchange rate remain limited to ±0.3% around a central rate, based on the market closing rate of the previous day. Daily fluctuations of the renminbi against other currencies will be limited to ±1.5%. End of intervention in the foreign exchange market to manage the exchange rate. Adoption of the ERM II.

Hong Kong SAR The Hong Kong Monetary Authority established a trading band of HK$7.75–HK$7.85 per US$1. Reclassification to crawling peg from conventional pegged arrangement. Because the official IMF classification is based on the de facto behavior of the exchange rate (i.e., actual or observed movements for at least three months), no reclassification has been made at this time. Reclassification to independently floating from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. No reclassification because the authorities are maintaining the currency board arrangement. Reclassification to managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate from independently floating. Reclassification to managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate from conventional pegged arrangement. Reclassification to crawling peg from exchange rate within crawling band. No reclassification, because the authorities are maintaining the currency board arrangement.

Reclassification to conventional fixed peg from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. Reclassification to independently floating from exchange rate within crawling bands. No reclassification because the authorities are maintaining the conventional pegged arrangement. No reclassification because the authorities are maintaining the currency board arrangement. Because the official IMF classification is based on the de facto behavior of the exchange rate (i.e., actual or observed movements for at least three months), no reclassification has been made at this time.

Changes in Exchange Arrangements, End-July 2005 Change Bangladesh Burundi Cameroon Authorized dealers were permitted to undertake currency swaps and forward exchange transactions only against underlying approved commercial transactions. Exchange bureaus were authorized to participate in the weekly foreign exchange auctions. The official exchange rate was changed from a weekly fixed rate determined in the central bank auction to the daily average of commercial bank rates. Taxes on foreign exchange transactions were eliminated. Congo, Republic of The commission applicable to payments destined to all countries was increased to 1% from 0.75%. The number of currencies for which the Czech National Bank publishes daily rates was increased to 29 from 16. Dominican Republic The foreign exchange market was unified. Czech Republic Latvia Madagascar Malaysia Mauritania Mexico Nicaragua São Tomé and Principe Serbia and Montenegro Sudan Suriname Swaziland Repeg from the SDR to the euro. In the context of the move to a computer-based foreign exchange trading system, the exchange rate for the dollar was quoted in addition to the euro in the official interbank market. Residents with permitted foreign currency borrowing were allowed to enter into interest rate swaps with onshore licensed banks, approved merchant banks, or licensed offshore banks in Labuan, provided that the transaction is supported by a firm underlying commitment. Residents were allowed to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts with licensed offshore banks and approved merchant banks to purchase or sell any foreign currency against ringgit or another foreign currency, provided that the contracts are supported by underlying transactions. The Central Bank of Mauritania suspended the foreign exchange auction mechanism and introduced an explicit system of foreign exchange rationing. The Bank of Mexico modified the daily auction mechanism for sales of dollars, distributing in equal parts the amount of dollars to be sold each day during the following four quarters (previously, one quarter). The annual rate of crawl (depreciation) of the córdoba against the dollar was reduced to 5% from 6%. The central bank issued a regulation reestablishing the foreign exchange auction. The National Bank of Serbia widened the margin between the buying and selling rates for foreign exchange transactions in cash to ±0.7% from ±0.6%. The exchange rate band was expanded to ±3% from ±2% around the previous day’s closing rate. The Suriname dollar replaced the Suriname guilder as the national currency; the conversion between the two currencies was effected at a rate of SRD 1 per Sf 1,000. The ceiling and floor of the market-determined exchange rate (set by commercial banks and cambios) were abolished. The South African rand was declared official legal tender in addition to the lilangeni, which remains official legal tender.

Starting May 2005, the exchange rate for private sector transactions is being quoted by the central bank rather than by the Commercial Bank of Syria. Decree 865 of March 2005 (to be implemented) authorizes private banks to apply the “free exchange rate for private transactions” to imports of raw materials and intermediate goods. A 1.5% fee was imposed on purchases of noncash foreign currency; the proceeds were earmarked for government pension insurance. Banks were temporarily prohibited from buying or selling foreign exchange at a rate that deviated more than 2 percent from the official exchange rate. Cash foreign currency bought from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) could be resold to the NBU within two months at the original purchase price. Banks were permitted to purchase foreign currency from the NBU on the interbank market only for their own needs and to fulfill the requirements of their clients (rather than other banks). Certain temporary measures effective until December 29, 2004, were adopted. Asset transaction volumes (other than those involving government or NBU securities, or interbank transactions) could not exceed the level of November 30, 2004. Foreign exchange sales by banks could not exceed $1,000 for cash transactions, and $50,000 for noncash transactions, except with the written consent of the bank manager (or authorized agent). Time deposits (local and foreign currency) could not be withdrawn prior to maturity. Banks were temporarily required to provide information before noon on requests accepted from clients for the purchase of foreign exchange in amounts greater than $100,000 on the interbank market that day. Banks that did not provide such information would not be allowed to participate in the market. Banks were temporarily prohibited from supplying foreign exchange bureaus with cash foreign exchange or traveler’s checks. The bolívar was re-pegged to Bs 2,144.60 (buying) and Bs 2,150.00 (selling) per $1 from Bs 1,915.20 (buying) and Bs 1,920 (selling) per $1. The percentage of export receipts that the foreign currency accounts of gold producers could be credited was raised to 40% from 20%, and tobacco producers were treated as direct exporters for the purpose of exchange rate management, as well as access to foreign currency. A guaranteed floor exchange rate of Z$6,200 per US$1 was introduced for inward remittances that was later revised to Z$9,000 per US$1 and Z$17,500 per US$1. An enhanced incentive framework was introduced for horticulture products.

Not for Redistribution COMPILATION GUIDE Status Under IMF Articles of Agreement Article VIII Article XIV The member country has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement. The member country continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, Section 2. Currency Other legal tender Exchange rate structure Classification Exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender Currency board arrangement Conventional pegged arrangement Pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands Exchange Arrangement The official legal tender of the country. The existence of another currency that is officially allowed to be used in the country. If there is one exchange rate, the system is called unitary; if there is more than one exchange rate that may be used simultaneously for different purposes and/or by differ- ent entities, the system is called dual or multiple. Different effective exchange rates resulting from exchange taxes or subsidies are not included in this category. The currency of another country circulates as the sole legal tender (formal dollariza- tion), or the member belongs to a monetary or currency union in which the same legal tender is shared by the members of the union. Adopting such a regime implies the complete surrender of the monetary authorities’ independent control over domestic monetary policy. A monetary regime based on an explicit legislative commitment to exchange domestic currency for a specified foreign currency at a fixed exchange rate, combined with restrictions on the issuing authority to ensure the fulfillment of its legal obligation. This implies that domestic currency will be issued only against foreign exchange and that it remains fully backed by foreign assets, eliminating traditional central bank functions such as monetary control and lender-of-last-resort, and leaving little scope for discretionary monetary policy. Some flexibility may still be afforded, depending on how strict the banking rules of the currency board arrangement are. The country (formally or de facto) pegs its currency at a fixed rate to another currency or a basket of currencies, where the basket is formed from the currencies of major trading or financial partners and weights reflect the geographic distribution of trade, services, or capital flows. The currency composites can also be standardized, as in the case of the SDR. There is no commitment to keep the parity irrevocably. The ex- change rate may fluctuate within narrow margins of less than ±1 percent around a central rate—or the maximum and minimum value of the exchange rate may remain within a narrow margin of 2 percent—for at least three months. The monetary author- ity stands ready to maintain the fixed parity through direct intervention (i.e., via sale or purchase of foreign exchange in the market) or indirect intervention (e.g., via ag- gressive use of interest rate policy, imposition of foreign exchange regulations, exer- cise of moral suasion that constrains foreign exchange activity, or through intervention by other public institutions). Flexibility of monetary policy, though lim- ited, is greater than in the case of exchange arrangements with no separate legal tender and currency boards because traditional central banking functions are still possible, and the monetary authority can adjust the level of the exchange rate, although rela- tively infrequently. The value of the currency is maintained within certain margins of fluctuation of at least ±1 percent around a fixed central rate, or the margin between the maximum and minimum value of the exchange rate exceeds 2 percent. It also includes arrangements of countries in the ERM of the European Monetary System (EMS), which was re- placed with the ERM II on January 1, 1999. There is a limited degree of monetary policy discretion, depending on the bandwidth. 7 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 8 Crawling peg Crawling band Managed floating with no pre- determined path for the exchange rate Independently floating Exchange tax Exchange subsidy Forward exchange market Official cover of forward operations COMPILATION GUIDE The currency is adjusted periodically in small amounts at a fixed rate or in response to changes in selective quantitative indicators, such as past inflation differentials vis-à- vis major trading partners or differentials between the inflation target and expected inflation in major trading partners. The rate of crawl can be set to generate inflation- adjusted changes in the exchange rate (backward looking), or set at a preannounced fixed rate and/or below the projected inflation differentials (forward looking). Main- taining a crawling peg imposes constraints on monetary policy in a manner similar to a fixed peg system. The currency is maintained within certain fluctuation margins of at least ±1 percent around a central rate—or the margin between the maximum and minimum value of the exchange rate exceeds 2 percent—and the central rate or margins are adjusted periodically at a fixed rate or in response to changes in selective quantitative indicators. The degree of exchange rate flexibility is a function of the bandwidth. Bands are either symmetric around a crawling central parity or widen gradually with an asymmetric choice of the crawl of upper and lower bands (in the latter case, there may be no preannounced central rate). The commitment to maintain the exchange rate within the band imposes constraints on monetary policy, with the degree of policy independence being a function of the bandwidth. The monetary authority attempts to influence the exchange rate without having a spe- cific exchange rate path or target. Indicators for managing the rate are broadly judg- mental (e.g., balance of payments position, international reserves, parallel market developments), and adjustments may not be automatic. Intervention may be direct or indirect. The exchange rate is market-determined, with any official foreign exchange market intervention aimed at moderating the rate of change and preventing undue fluctuations in the exchange rate, rather than establishing a level for it. Foreign exchange transactions are subject to a special tax. Bank commissions charged on foreign exchange transactions are not included in this category; rather, they are listed under the exchange arrangement classification. Foreign exchange transactions are subsidized by using separate, nonmarket exchange rates. The existence of a forward exchange market. Official coverage of forward operations refers to the case in which an official entity (the central bank or the government) assumes the exchange risk of certain foreign exchange transactions. Prescription of currency requirements Arrangements for Payments and Receipts The official requirements affecting the selection of currency and the method of set- tlement for transactions with other countries. When a country has payments agree- ments with other countries, the terms of these agreements often lead to a prescription of currency for specified categories of payments to, and receipts from, the countries concerned. This category includes information on the use of domestic currency in transactions between residents and nonresidents, both domestically and abroad; it also indicates any restrictions on the use of foreign currency among residents. Payments arrangements Bilateral payments arrangements Regional arrangements Two countries have an agreement to prescribe specific rules for payments to each other, including cases in which private parties are also obligated to use specific currencies. These agreements can be either operative or inoperative. More than two parties participate in a payments agreement. ©International Monetary Fund.

The official bodies of two or more countries agree to offset exports of goods and services to one country with imports of goods and services from the same country, without payment. The authorities’ division of responsibility for monitoring policy, administering exchange controls, and determining the extent of delegation of powers to outside agencies (often banks are authorized to effect foreign exchange transactions). Restrictions on payments and transfers in connection with international transactions imposed by member countries for reasons of national or international security. International security restrictions on the basis of IMF Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51), which establishes the obligation of members to notify the IMF before imposing such restrictions, or, if circumstances preclude advance notification, as promptly as possible. Sanctions imposed against a second body on the basis of a UN decision. Official or private residents of a member default on their payments or transfers in foreign exchange to nonresidents. This category includes only the situation in which domestic currency is available for residents to settle their debts, but they are unable to obtain foreign exchange—for example, because of the presence of an officially an- nounced or unofficial queuing system; it does not cover nonpayment by private parties due to bankruptcy of the party concerned. Separate rules for trading in gold domestically and with foreign countries. Regulations governing the physical movement of means of payment between countries. Where information is available, the category distinguishes between separate limits for the (1) export and import of banknotes by travelers and (2) export and import of banknotes by banks and other authorized financial institutions. Resident Accounts Indicates whether resident accounts that are maintained in the national currency or in foreign currency, locally or abroad, are allowed and describes how they are treated and the facilities and limitations attached to such accounts. When there is more than one type of resident account, the nature and operation of the various types of accounts are also described; for example, whether residents are allowed to open foreign ex- change accounts with or without approval from the exchange control authority, whether these accounts may be held domestically or abroad, and whether the balances on accounts held by residents in domestic currency may be converted into foreign currency. Nonresident Accounts Indicates whether local nonresident accounts maintained in the national currency or in foreign currency are allowed and describes how they are treated and the facilities and limitations attached to such accounts. When there is more than one type of nonresident account, the nature and operation of the various types of accounts are also described. Accounts of nonresidents, usually in domestic currency.

Information on the existence of a foreign exchange plan, i.e., prior allocation of a certain amount of foreign exchange, usually on an annual basis, for the importation of specific types of goods and/or services; in some cases, also differentiating among individual importers. Information on specific import-financing regulations limiting the rights of residents to enter into private contracts in which the financing options differ from those in the official regulations. The obligation to domicile the transactions with a specified (usually domestic) financial institution. Most often a compulsory government measure aimed at establishing the veracity of the import contract in terms of volume, quality, and price. Parties are obligated to use letters of credit as a form of payment for their imports. Import licenses are used not for trade purposes but to restrict the availability of for- eign exchange for legitimate trade. A list of goods that may be imported. A list of goods that may not be imported. Indicates arrangements whereby certain imports or other international transactions are exempt from the restrictive application of licensing requirements. Refers to cases where a license for the importation of a certain good is granted, but a specific limit is imposed on the amount to be imported. May include prohibitions on imports of certain goods from all countries or of all goods from a certain country. Several other nontariff measures are used by members (e.g., phytosanitary examinations, setting of standards), but these are not covered fully in the report. A brief description of the import tax and tariff system, including taxes levied on the foreign exchange made available for imports. Indicates if any taxes apply to the exchange side of an import transaction. Private parties are not allowed to engage in the importation of certain products or they are limited in their activity. Exports and Export Proceeds Describes restrictions on the use of export proceeds, as well as regulations on exports. The obligation of exporters to repatriate export proceeds. Regulations requiring the recipient of repatriated export proceeds to sell, sometimes at a specified exchange rate, any foreign exchange proceeds in return for local currency to the central bank, commercial banks, foreign exchange markets, or exchange dealers authorized for this purpose. ©International Monetary Fund.

The same categories as in the case of imports are used. Restrictions on the right of residents to export goods. These restrictions may take the form of quotas (where a certain quantity of shipment abroad is allowed) or the ab- sence of quotas (where the licenses are issued at the discretion of the foreign trade control authority). A brief description of the export tax system, including any taxes that are levied on foreign exchange earned by exporters. Payments for Invisible Transactions and Current Transfers Describes the procedures for effecting payments abroad in connection with current transactions in invisibles, with reference to prior approval requirements, the existence of quantitative and indicative limits, and/or bona fide tests. Detailed information on the most common categories of transactions is provided only when regulations differ for the various categories. Indicative limits establish maximum amounts up to which the purchase of foreign exchange is allowed upon declaration of the nature of the transaction, mainly for statistical purposes. Amounts above those limits are granted if the bona fide nature of the transaction is established by the presentation of appropriate documentation. Bona fide tests also may be applied to transactions for which quantita- tive limits have not been established. Includes freight and insurance (including possible regulations on non–trade related insurance payments and transfers); unloading and storage costs; administrative ex- penses; commissions; and customs duties and fees. Includes profits and dividends; interest payments (including interest on debentures, mortgages, etc.); amortization of loans or depreciation of foreign direct investments; and payments and transfers of rent. Includes international travel for business, medical treatment, tourism, etc. Includes medical expenditures abroad; study expenses abroad; pensions (including regulations on payments and transfers of pensions by both state and private pension providers on behalf of nonresidents, as well as the transfer of pensions due to residents living abroad); and family maintenance and alimony (including regulations on payments and transfers abroad of family maintenance and alimony by residents).

Includes subscription and membership fees, authors’ royalties, consulting and legal fees, etc. Trade-related payments Investment-related payments Payments for travel Personal payments Foreign workers’ wages Credit card use abroad Other payments Proceeds from Invisible Transactions and Current Transfers Repatriation requirements Restrictions on use of funds Describes regulations governing exchange receipts derived from transactions in invis- ibles—including descriptions of any limitations on their conversion into domestic currency—and the use of those receipts. The definitions of repatriation and surrender requirements are similar to those applied to export proceeds. Refers mainly to the limitations imposed on the use of receipts previously deposited in certain types of bank accounts. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 12 COMPILATION GUIDE Capital Transactions Describes regulations influencing both inward and outward capital flows. The concept of controls on capital transactions is interpreted broadly. Thus, controls on capital transactions include prohibitions; need for prior approval, authorization, and notifica- tion; dual and multiple exchange rates; discriminatory taxes; and reserve requirements or interest penalties imposed by the authorities that regulate the conclusion or execu- tion of transactions or transfers, or the holding of assets at home by nonresidents and abroad by residents. The coverage of the regulations applies to receipts as well as to payments and to actions initiated by nonresidents and residents. In addition, because of the close association with capital transactions, information is also provided on local financial operations conducted in foreign currency, describing specific regulations in force that limit residents’ and nonresidents’ issuing of securities denominated in foreign currency or, generally, limitations on contract agreements expressed in foreign exchange. Refers to public offerings or private placements on primary markets or their listing on secondary markets. Refers to shares and other securities of a participating nature, and bonds and other securities with an original maturity of more than one year. Includes transactions involving shares and other securities of a participating nature if they are not effected for the purpose of acquiring a lasting economic interest in the management of the enterprise concerned. Investment for the purpose of acquiring a lasting economic interest is addressed under foreign direct investments. Refers to bonds and other securities with an original maturity of more than one year. The term “other securities” includes notes and debentures. Refers to securities with an original maturity of one year or less and includes short- term instruments, such as certificates of deposit and bills of exchange. The category also includes treasury bills and other short-term government paper, banker’s acceptances, commercial papers, interbank deposits, and repurchase agreements. Includes share certificates and registry entries or other evidence of investor interest in an institution for collective investment, such as mutual funds, and unit and investment trusts. Refers to operations in other negotiable instruments and nonsecured claims not covered under the above subsections. These may include operations in rights; war- rants; financial options and futures; secondary market operations in other financial claims (including sovereign loans, mortgage loans, commercial credits, negotiable instruments originating as loans, receivables, and discounted bills of trade); forward operations (including those in foreign exchange); swaps of bonds and other debt securities; credits and loans; and other swaps (e.g., interest rate, debt/equity, equity/debt, foreign currency, as well as swaps of any of the instruments listed above). Controls on operations in foreign exchange without any other underlying transaction (spot or forward trading on the foreign exchange markets, forward cover operations, etc.) are also included. Covers operations directly linked with international trade transactions or with the rendering of international services. Includes credits other than commercial credits granted by all residents, including banks, to nonresidents, or vice versa. Includes those provided by residents to nonresidents and vice versa. It also includes securities pledged for payment or performance of a contract—such as warrants, performance bonds, and standby letters of credit—and financial backup facilities that are credit facilities used as a guarantee for independent financial operations.

These investments are essentially for the purpose of producing goods and services, and, in particular, investments that allow investor participation in the management of the enterprise. The category includes the creation or extension of a wholly owned enterprise, subsidiary, or branch and the acquisition of full or partial ownership of a new or existing enterprise that results in effective influence over the operations of the enterprise. Refers to the transfer of principal, including the initial capital and capital gains, of a foreign direct investment as defined above. Refers to the acquisition of real estate not associated with direct investment, including, for example, investments of a purely financial nature in real estate or the acquisition of real estate for personal use. Covers transfers initiated on behalf of private persons and intended to benefit other private persons. It includes transactions involving property to which the promise of a return to the owner with payments of interest is attached (e.g., loans or settlements of debt in their country of origin by immigrants), and transfers effected free of charge to the beneficiary (e.g., gifts and endowments, loans, inheritances and legacies, or emi- grants’ assets). Describes regulations that are specific to these institutions, such as monetary, pruden- tial, and foreign exchange controls. Inclusion of an entry in this category does not necessarily signify that the aim of the measure is to control the flow of capital. Some of these items (e.g., borrowing abroad, lending to nonresidents, purchase of locally issued securities denominated in foreign exchange, investment regulations) may merely be repetitions of the entries under respective categories of controls on capital and money market instruments, on credit operations, or on direct investments, when the same regulations apply to commercial banks as well as to other residents. Describes regulations on certain commercial bank balance sheet items (including capital) and on limits covering commercial banks’ positions in foreign currencies (including gold). Describes controls specific to institutions such as insurance companies and pension funds. Refers to additional regulations on capital transfers imposed by law, such as controls on the listing of foreign securities on local security markets. ©International Monetary Fund.

The following countries were reclassified subsequent to that date: Botswana, Guinea, and Latvia. 2 An asterisk (*) indicates that the country has an IMF-supported or other monetary program. A dagger (†) indicates that the country adopts more than one nominal anchor in conducting monetary policy (it should be noted, however, that it would not be possible, for practical reasons, to include in this table which nominal anchor plays the principal role in conducting monetary policy). 3 The ECCU has a currency board arrangement. 4 These countries have no explicitly stated nominal anchor, but rather monitor various indicators in conducting monetary policy. 5 The printing of new colones, the domestic currency, is prohibited, but the existing stock of colones will continue to circulate along with the U.S. dollar as legal tender until all colón notes wear out physically. 6 In the Republika Srpska, the Serbian dinar circulates. 7 The member participates in the ERM II of the European monetary system. 8 The member maintains an exchange arrangement involving more than one foreign exchange market. The arrangement shown is that maintained in the major market. 9 The regime operating de facto in the country is different from its de jure regime. 10 Comoros has the same arrangement with the French Treasury as the CFA franc zone countries. 11 The band widths for these countries are as follows: Cyprus ±15%, Denmark ±2.25%, Hungary ±15%, Slovenia (unannounced), and Tonga ±5%. 12 The band widths for this country are adjusted frequently. 13 The description of the exchange rate regime applies to the Republic of Serbia only, which accounts for about 93% of the economy of Serbia and Montenegro; in the Republic of Montenegro, the euro is legal tender. In the UN-administered province of Kosovo, the euro is the most widely used currency. 14 Insufficient information on the country is available to confirm this classification, so the classification of the last official consultation is used. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Exchange Rate Arrangements and Anchors of Monetary Policy 17 Classification of Exchange Rate Arrangements and Monetary Policy Frameworks The classification system is based on the members’ actual, de facto, regimes, which may differ from their officially announced arrangements. The scheme ranks exchange rate regimes on the basis of the degree of flexibility of the arrangement. It distinguishes among the more rigid forms of pegged regimes (such as currency board arrangements), other conventional fixed peg regimes against a single currency or a basket of currencies, exchange rate bands around a fixed peg, crawling peg arrangements, and exchange rate bands around crawling pegs, in order to help assess the implications of the choice of exchange rate regime for the degree of independence of monetary policy. This includes a category to distinguish the exchange arrangements of those countries that have no separate legal tender. The system presents members’ exchange rate regimes against alternative monetary policy frameworks with the intention of using both criteria as a way of providing greater transparency in the classification scheme and to illustrate that different forms of exchange rate regimes could be consistent with similar monetary frameworks. The categories are explained in the compilation guide. Members’ exchange rate regimes are presented against alternative monetary policy frameworks in order to present the role of the exchange rate in broad economic policy and help identify potential sources of inconsistency in the monetary–exchange rate policy mix. The monetary policy frameworks listed are as follows: Exchange rate anchor The monetary authority stands ready to buy or sell foreign exchange at given quoted rates to maintain the exchange rate at its predetermined level or range (the exchange rate serves as the nominal anchor or intermediate target of monetary policy). These regimes cover exchange rate regimes with no separate legal tender, currency board arrangements, fixed pegs with or without bands, and crawling pegs with or without bands, where the rate of crawl is set in a forward-looking manner. Monetary aggregate target The monetary authority uses its instruments to achieve a target growth rate for a monetary aggregate (reserve money, M1, M2, etc.), and the targeted aggregate becomes the nominal anchor or intermediate target of monetary policy. Inflation targeting framework This involves the public announcement of medium-term numerical targets for inflation, with an institutional commitment by the monetary authority to achieve these targets. Additional key features include increased communication with the public and the markets about the plans and objectives of monetary policymakers and increased accountability of the central bank for obtaining its inflation objectives. Monetary policy decisions are guided by the deviation of forecasts of future inflation from the announced inflation target, with the inflation forecast acting (implicitly or explicitly) as the intermediate target of monetary policy. IMF-supported or other monetary program This involves implementation of monetary and exchange rate policy within the confines of a framework that establishes floors for international reserves and ceilings for net domestic assets of the central bank. As the ceiling on net domestic assets limits increases in reserve money through central bank operations, indicative targets for reserve money may be appended to this system.

Not for Redistribution ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN (Position as of December 31, 2004) Status Under IMF Articles of Agreement Article XIV Yes. Currency Exchange rate structure Unitary Classification Managed floating with no pre- determined path for the exchange rate Exchange tax Exchange subsidy Forward exchange market Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan is the Afghani. Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB), the central bank, maintains a daily official rate defined in terms of the dollar and based on the average of the opening quotations of a number of important and reputable money traders operating in a free market in the form of a money bazaar. In principle, the DAB’s buying and selling rates for foreign cash are within margins of ±1%; in practice, however, the DAB’s transactions have been limited to buying and thus have little impact on the exchange rate movements in the market. A second exchange rate—the official rate—is applied to certain transactions of the central government (mainly debt-service payments) and certain foreign currency income earned in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Most convertible currency transactions are effected at the free market exchange rate. The DAB posts rates for dollars, euros, Indian rupees, Pakistan rupees, pounds sterling, and Swiss francs. These rates are calculated using the IMF’s daily SDR rates for these currencies. n.a. n.a. There are no arrangements for forward cover against exchange rate risk in operations in the official market or the commercial banking sector. Prescription of currency requirements Controls on the use of domestic currency Payments arrangements Bilateral payments arrangements Operative Inoperative Administration of control International security restrictions Arrangements for Payments and Receipts Settlements with countries with which the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan maintains bilateral payments agreements are made in bilateral accounting dollars, in accordance with the procedures set forth in these agreements. Exchange rates for trade under bilateral payments agreements are specified in each agreement. The proceeds from exports of karakul to all countries must be obtained in convertible currencies. There are no other prescriptions of currency requirements. The Afghani is used for all transactions and settlements of accounts unless the use of another currency is specified by the parties concerned. The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan maintains bilateral payments agreements with Bulgaria, China, and Russia; however, some of these have been inoperative for several years. Yes. Yes. Foreign exchange transactions are controlled by the government through the DAB. No restrictions apply to transactions in the free exchange market. n.a. 25 ©International Monetary Fund.

Imports and reexports of gold are permitted, subject to regulations. Exports of gold bullion, silver, and jewelry require permission from the DAB and the MOF. Commercial exports of gold and silver jewelry and other articles containing small quantities of gold or silver do not require a license. Customs duties are payable on imports and exports of silver in any form, unless the transaction is made by, or on behalf of, the monetary authorities. Travelers may take out up to Af 2,000 in domestic banknotes and Af 50 in coins. Travelers entering the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan are required to spend a minimum of the equivalent of $26 a day in foreign exchange. They may take any amount out of the country that was declared upon arrival, subject to this minimum conversion requirement.

Payments through the banking system for imports to countries with which the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan has payments agreements may be made only through LCs. Payments to other countries may be made through LCs, against bills for collection, or under an arrangement in which the importer imports goods of at least an equivalent value to the payment made through the banking system. Except for public sector imports under the government budget, all importers are required to provide minimum import deposits with banks when they open LCs. The deposit ratios, based on the c.i.f. value of imports, are 20% for essential products, and range from 30% to 60% for other products. All importers must obtain a license from the Ministry of Commerce for statistical purposes. A license is issued on the basis of appropriate documents that have been approved by the Chamber of Commerce. For imports of nonessential goods, a 1% fee, based on the import value, is levied and is payable in dollars. The Chamber of Commerce charges a 2% fee to members and a 2.5% fee to nonmembers. The fee is based on the value of the imports. Most bilateral agreements specify quantities (and sometimes prices) for the products to be traded. The importation of certain drugs, liquor, arms, and ammunition is prohibited on grounds of public policy or for security reasons; in some instances, however, special permission to import these goods may be granted.

These retained proceeds may be used either directly by the original exporter or sold to other importers. In either case, the retained proceeds are converted at the clearing rate applicable to that particular bilateral arrangement. In the case of exports to countries trading in convertible currencies, export proceeds may be retained abroad for three, six, or twelve months, depending on the country of destination. During the relevant period, the exporter may use these funds to import any goods not included on the list of prohibited goods. Alternatively, at the end of the relevant holding period, foreign exchange holdings abroad must be repatriated and held in a foreign currency account with a bank in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan or sold at the commercial exchange rate. Proceeds from exports of raisins, fresh fruits, animal casings, skins, licorice roots, medicinal herbs, and wool must be surrendered immediately at the commercial exchange rate. n.a. n.a.

New financing in the form of financial credits to or bond issues by private borrowers must be matched by foreign exchange sales to the MULC. The prior approval requirement for servicing nonfinancial and financial private debt is applicable only for debts of financial institutions that have opted for the BCRA’s refinancing mechanism (matching). In these cases, the financial institutions must present a restructuring plan for their external liabilities to the BCRA for approval. Once approved, payments may be made in accordance with the schedule agreed to with the creditors without further BCRA approval. Effective December 31, 2004, the monthly ceiling for purchases of foreign exchange by residents for various transactions, across all financial institutions, was raised to the equivalent of US$2 million from US$500,000 or the peso amount paid by customers to purchase foreign exchange for these various transactions, which must not exceed the peso equivalent of the sum of export duty payments plus three times the taxes on bank current account credits and debits paid by taxpayers to the Federal Public Revenue Administration during the second to last calendar month before the reporting month. The transactions covered are real estate investments abroad, loans to nonresidents, direct investment abroad by residents, portfolio investments abroad by individuals, other investments abroad by residents, portfolio investments abroad by legal entities, purchases of foreign banknotes for domestic holdings, and purchases of traveler’s checks. The exceptions to the ceilings are purchases of foreign assets for use in the restructuring of residents’ external debts or for debt service payments within 90 days of the date of the entry of the foreign assets into the market. Sales of foreign exchange to nonresidents exceeding US$5,000 a calendar month are subject to prior approval by the BCRA. This limit does not apply to international organizations. This limit is no longer applicable to the repatriation of foreign exchange proceeds collected domestically from the principal of national public bonds (issued either in domestic or foreign currency, provided that proof is submitted for the surrender on the exchange market of the foreign exchange received in payment). Effective December 31, 2004, this limit ceased to apply to the external debt of residents importing into Argentina goods, services, and financial items derived from external loans to nonresidents and validated by an external debt declaration; loans collected after domestic bankruptcies; and credits to the accounts of domestic institutions of export proceeds from transactions through payment and reciprocal loan agreements with the LAIA and the Dominican Republic, and bilateral arrangements with Malaysia and the Russian Federation. These loans were discounted by foreign institutions because the exporter joined the MULC and surrendered the funds received abroad from the discount. Also, effective December 31, 2004, a monthly cap of US$2 million was placed on purchases of foreign exchange by nonresidents for the following transactions: sales of direct investments in the private sector and servicing or sale of other inward portfolio investments in foreign exchange for periods of no less than 180 consecutive days (and their rents).

The components of the overall foreign exchange position of institutions are as follows: freely usable gold holdings, foreign exchange and foreign currency banknotes in the country and abroad; holdings of deposits and investments at all terms in banks abroad; investments in foreign private and public bonds; other liquid investments abroad; and debit and credit balances in correspondent accounts. Also included are purchases and sales of these assets arranged and pending settlement through foreign exchange purchases and sales to customers at terms of no more than 48 business hours. Not included in the overall foreign exchange positions are the foreign assets third parties hold in custody, correspondent balances as a result of transfers by third parties pending settlement, forward sales and purchases of foreign exchange or foreign securities, and direct investments abroad. The upper limit of the overall foreign exchange position is recalculated monthly and the update takes effect on the first business day of each month. The upper limit is set at 10% of the U.S. dollar equivalent of the bank’s net worth at the end of the second-to-last month preceding the month of the deadline for submission of the foreign exchange to the BCRA, under the rules of the corresponding reporting regime. It will be increased by the U.S. dollar amount equivalent to 5% of the institution’s turnover of foreign exchange purchases and sales to customers in the second-to-last preceding calendar month, and to 2% of total demand and term deposits established and payable domestically in foreign exchange, excluding deposits held in custody, reported by the institution at the close of the second-to- last preceding calendar month. If the maximum calculated is less than US$1.5 million, this latter amount will be considered the lower limit of the established maximum. The limit on banks’ U.S. dollar exposure is 10% of a bank’s net worth. The absolute value of the overall net position in foreign exchange—as a monthly average of daily balances converted to pesos at the reference exchange rate—may not exceed 30% of the net liabilities of the preceding month. When the net foreign exchange position is positive, the amount may not exceed that proportion of liquid own resources. Excesses may be subject to a charge of up to the ©International Monetary Fund.

Status Under IMF Articles of Agreement Currency Exchange rate structure Classification Independently floating Exchange tax Exchange subsidy Forward exchange market Prescription of currency requirements Use of foreign exchange among residents Exchange Arrangement The currency of Armenia is the Armenian dram. Unitary. Armenia has adopted an independently floating exchange rate regime. The Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) pursues a policy of monetary targeting, for which it manages the reserve money as its operational target and intervenes in the foreign exchange market only to smooth the fluctuations of reserve money. Foreign exchange transactions take place predominantly in the interbank market, in which the CBA also participates. Foreign exchange auctions in the stock exchange are not yet carried out, although the stock exchange infrastructure is in place. Purchases and sales of foreign currency may be implemented through foreign exchange entities licensed by the CBA, including banks, foreign exchange dealers, credit institutions, and foreign exchange bureaus; or, in the case of the government, through the CBA itself, which acts as the government’s financial agent. Foreign exchange entities carry out foreign exchange transactions by setting their own buying and selling rates for major currencies against the dram without any restrictions. The exchange rate of the dram against the U.S. dollar is determined on the basis of exchange rates prevailing in the interbank market on the previous day. The official exchange rate is set as the average (midpoint) of the CBA’s buying and selling rates. The official exchange rate is used for accounting purposes and in daily operations with the treasury. Foreign exchange entities use the official exchange rate of the CBA for bookkeeping and revaluation purposes. Foreign exchange entities and other business entities determine exchange rates for their operations independently. No. No. Residents and nonresidents may negotiate freely forward exchange contracts for both commercial and financial transactions in all leading convertible currencies in the domestic exchange market and at major international foreign exchange markets. However, for the time being, the forward exchange market in Armenia is still undeveloped, although some banks sign forward contracts in small amounts. The CBA conducts foreign exchange swaps as a short-term instrument. Arrangements for Payments and Receipts Effective June 28, 2005, under the new foreign exchange law, prices of and payments for goods, services, wages, and investments in statutory and share capital of legal entities are quoted and made, respectively, in dram only; prizes are advertised and paid out in dram also.

Previously, residents were prohibited from using foreign exchange as a means of payment within Armenia. Armenia maintains agreements with Russia and Turkmenistan. Armenia is a signatory of the 1993 Treaty of Economic Union (with Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan), which provides for the eventual establishment of a customs union, a payments union, cooperation on investment, industrial development, and customs procedures. Armenia also joined the Agreement on the Establishment of a Payments Union of CIS member countries. Armenia is a member of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation, together with Albania, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, Moldova, Romania, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine. Bilateral free trade agreements have been signed with Georgia, the Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, and Ukraine, though only the agreement with Russia is in operation. Armenia is an observer of the European Asian Economic Community. There is an arrangement with Turkmenistan for the importation of natural gas. In addition, bilateral clearing agreements with the Baltic countries, Russia, and the other countries of the FSU exist, but all have become largely inoperative. The CBA is the main body that formulates and administers exchange rate policy and that may issue foreign exchange regulations within Armenia. The CBA also has the overall responsibility for currency control, in close collaboration with the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE). In general, the MOFE exercises authority over ministries and other administrative authorities, municipal authorities, budgetary organizations, and state funds. The CBA exercises authority over the activities of all other agents.

Among the goods subject to control are narcotic, psychotropic, and therapeutic substances; firearms and certain weapons; certain chemicals and primary commodities; some glazed ceramicware; rough diamonds; and various dangerous goods. These controls are maintained mainly to meet health and safety requirements; to meet certain requirements for labeling, packaging, or technical specifications; and to satisfy certain obligations arising from Australia’s membership in international commodity agreements or to meet obligations under international trade embargoes. A general tariff of 5% applies to many manufactured goods, with the following exceptions. The tariff on passenger motor vehicles and certain automotive components is 10% and is scheduled to be reduced to 5% by 2010. Textiles, clothing, and footwear are subject to tariffs ranging from zero to 17.5%. Under the government’s post-2005 assistance arrangement for the textile, clothing, and footwear industry, tariffs on these products will be reduced to levels of 5% and 10% by January 1, 2010, and to 5% by January 1, 2015. Tariffs for a large range of goods have been abolished. Tariff concessions are available under the Tariff Concession System (TCS) for most goods subject to a tariff, where it can be substantiated that there is no domestic manufacturer of substitutable goods. However, a general revenue duty of 3% applies to all industrial inputs that are eligible for a tariff concession under the TCS.

Licenses are required for exports of unprocessed wood, including wood chips. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF) administers export control powers in relation to regulated dairy products under the provisions of the Dairy Produce Act. The DAFF also administers quotas for beef and sheep meat into the restricted U.S. and EU markets. This system allows the management of exports to some markets where quantitative restrictions apply. Cattle, sheep or goat meat, and livestock may be exported only by persons or firms licensed by the DAFF. If other countries impose quantitative restrictions on imports of meat or livestock, the DAFF may, in conjunction with industry, introduce measures to control Australian exports to conform with those restrictions. There are also a number of WTO-notified state trading enterprises in Australia that have export control powers, including Horticulture Australia Limited, the Australian Wheat Board International (AWBI), and the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. The AWBI has veto power over licenses for the export of bulk wheat. Australia has a complete ban on the export of merino ewes, their genetic material, ova, and embryos to any country other than New Zealand. However, merino breeding rams purchased at designated export auctions and semen from rams included in the National Register of Semen Export Donors (administered by the Australian Association of Stud Merino Breeders) may be exported. Sales are subject to DAFF approval and an annual quota of 800 rams a year, with a provision for up to 100 rams to be placed on a semen donor register. No ram nominated for collection of semen for export may be physically exported. The export restrictions do not apply to merino rams intended for slaughter; however, the export of these rams is subject to controls to ensure that they do not enter breeding stocks, and a legal undertaking by the exporter to ensure that these exported merino rams will be slaughtered.

The U.S. dollar circulates concurrently with the Bahamian dollar. In addition to the official exchange market, there is a market in which investment currency may be negotiated among residents through the Central Bank of The Bahamas (CBB); the current premium bid and offer rates are 20% and 25%, respectively. The use of investment currency is prescribed for the purchase of foreign currency securities from nonresidents and direct investments outside The Bahamas. In certain circumstances, the CBB may also permit residents to retain and use foreign currency from other sources to make such outward investments. Certain external investments (including investment in foreign stocks by company-based retirement funds) may be effected at the official exchange rate without paying the investment currency premium. The Bahamian dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at par. Buying and selling rates for the pound sterling are also officially quoted, with the buying rate based on the rate in the New York market; the selling rate is 0.5% above the buying rate. The CBB deals only with commercial banks. For transactions with the public, commercial banks are authorized to charge a commission of 0.50% buying and 0.75% selling per US$1, and 0.50% buying or selling per £1. A stamp tax of 1.5% is applied to all outward remittances.

Amounts in nonresident taka accounts covering unapproved payments may be blocked by the BB. Imports and Import Payments No. A margin requirement of 50% applies on 55 goods. Effective January 1, 2005, advance payments for permissible imports of goods and services may be effected by ADs without prior BB permission against a repayment guarantee acceptable to the ADs from a bank abroad. This guarantee is to be invoked for refund of the amount paid in advance in the event of the supplier’s default in delivering the goods or services as per contract. However, advance payments of up to $2,500 for imports of books, journals, or lifesaving medicines will not require any repayment guarantee. Previously, advance payments for up to the equivalent in value of $2,500 could be made for certain imports. The BB also allowed other advance payments covering imports of specialized or capital goods, usually against a guarantee from a first-class overseas bank.

Recognized export-oriented units operating under the bonded warehouse system may import up to four months’ requirements of their raw and packing materials by establishing import LCs without reference to any export LC. They may also effect such imports by opening back-to-back LCs (either on a sight basis under the Export Development Fund, or for up to 180 days on a usance basis) against export LCs received by them. ADs may establish LCs on an f.o.b. basis without the approval of the BB, subject to certain conditions. Foreign exchange for authorized imports is provided automatically by ADs when payments are due. All importers (including all government departments, with the exception of the Ministry of Defense) are required to obtain LCAFs for all imports.

Firms in the industrial sector are assigned an import quota for specified raw materials and packing materials, and LCAFs are issued on the basis of the quota. The quota system does not apply to raw materials and packing materials that may be imported freely but applies to items appearing on the control list. Separate LCAFs may be issued to industrial consumers of machinery parts and accessories. Goods imported against LCAFs issued to industrial consumers must be used in the industry concerned and may not be sold or transferred without prior approval.

Exchange control is administered jointly by the MOF and the BCEAO. Regulations governing the external financial relations of WAEMU member states delegate the approval process for most foreign exchange transactions to authorized banks. The only transactions that remain subject to the prior authorization of these institutions relate to outward investment, the domestic and foreign currency accounts of residents, and resident accounts abroad.

Status Under IMF Articles of Agreement Currency Exchange rate structure Dual Classification Crawling peg Exchange tax Exchange subsidy Forward exchange market Official cover of forward operations Prescription of currency requirements Payments arrangements Bilateral payments arrangements Exchange Arrangement The currency of Botswana is the Botswana pula. Some external loans undertaken by parastatals before October 1, 1990, are protected from exchange rate movements under a Foreign Exchange Risk-Sharing Scheme (FERSS). Under the scheme, risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations up to 4% are borne fully by the borrower, while the next 6% and the following 5% of fluctuations are shared between the borrower and the government in ratios of 50:50 and 25:75, respectively. Risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations in excess of 15% are borne fully by the government. The scheme is symmetrical in that the borrower and the government share any gains from an appreciation in the external value of the pula on the same basis. Under the FERSS, borrowers obtain foreign exchange for servicing their external debt at exchange rates that may differ from the market rate by more than 2%. No new loans will be issued under this scheme, and the scheme is to be phased out by 2006, once the existing loans are fully repaid by 2006. The exchange rate of the pula is determined with reference to a weighted basket of currencies comprising the SDR (approximately 30%) and the South African rand (approximately 70%). On February 6, 2004, the Bank of Botswana (BOB) devalued the pula by 7.5% against this basket. Effective May 31, 2005, the pula was further devalued by 12%. The BOB announced that from that date, the pula would be adjusted continuously against the basket on the basis of the differential between expected inflation in Botswana and that in major trading partner countries. As a result, the exchange arrangement of Botswana was reclassified, effective May 31, 2005, to the category crawling peg from the category conventional pegged arrangement. Also effective this date, the spread between the buying and selling rates of the pula was widened to 0.5% from 0.125%. The BOB deals in the following currencies: the dollar, the South African rand, the euro, the pound sterling, and the yen. Foreign exchange bureaus are licensed to deal in foreign currencies on a spot basis only. No. No. Forward exchange cover is offered by the commercial banks, and the maturity dates of forward exchange contracts and transactions are not restricted. Yes. Arrangements for Payments and Receipts Residents are permitted to make payments for goods and services from outside sources using pula-denominated checks, provided that traders outside Botswana are willing to accept their collection by banks outside Botswana. Such transactions are subject to supporting documentation for checks in amounts exceeding P 10,000.

Unitary. The exchange rate of the real is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. Transactions in the exchange markets are carried out by banks, brokers, tourist agencies, and providers of accommodation for tourists that are authorized to deal in foreign exchange. Brokers and tourist agencies deal only in banknotes, bank drafts, and traveler’s checks. Providers of accommodation for tourists may only buy banknotes, bank drafts, and traveler’s checks. A 5% tax is applied to inflows related to external loans with a minimum maturity of up to 90 days. A 2% tax is applied to remittances related to obligations of credit card administration companies to pay for purchases by their clients. The tax is zero for other foreign exchange transactions. No. Banks are permitted to trade foreign exchange on a forward basis within statutory limits (bought and sold) of the exchange position; such transactions must be settled within 360 days. Arrangements for Payments and Receipts Prescription of currency is required only in foreign exchange transactions related to the LAIA covenant. These transactions must be made in dollars. The use of foreign exchange for pricing or settlement of transactions among residents is prohibited. All interbank transactions and clearinghouse operations must be effected through the Central Bank of Brazil’s (CBB) real-time gross-settlement payments system. Brazil is a member of the LAIA. Payments between Brazil and Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and República Bolivariana de Venezuela may be made through special central bank accounts within the framework of the multilateral clearing system of the LAIA. The National Monetary Council (NMC) is responsible for formulating the overall foreign exchange policy. In accordance with the guidelines established by the NMC, exchange control regulations affecting foreign capital and the management of international reserves are under the jurisdiction of the CBB. Foreign trade policy is formulated by the Chamber of Foreign Trade, which consists of the minister of development, industry, and foreign trade (head); the minister of the civil house; the minister of finance; the minister of planning, budget, and administration; the minister of foreign affairs; and the minister of agriculture and supply. The Ministry of Development, Industry, and Foreign Trade is in charge of implementing trade policy, through the Secretariat of Foreign Trade (SECEX).

Transactions that occur in the financial market are regulated by the CBB. The first domestic transaction of newly mined gold on this market is subject to a financial transactions tax of at least 1%. Rules regarding gold transactions for industrial purposes are defined separately by the federal states, which also establish different rates for the commercial tax levied thereon. Yes. The CBB and authorized institutions may buy and sell gold for monetary use on the international market. Imports and exports of gold for nonmonetary use are subject to the same procedures as those that are applied through the SECEX with respect to other products. Travelers may take out or bring in domestic or foreign banknotes, checks, or traveler’s checks without restriction but must declare to customs any amount over R$10,000 or its equivalent. Resident Accounts Foreign exchange accounts permitted These accounts may be held by authorized foreign exchange dealers, tourist agencies not authorized to deal in foreign exchange, Brazilian citizens living abroad, the Brazilian Post Office Administration, credit card administration companies, companies responsible for the development and execution of projects in the energy sector, and insurance and reinsurance companies and reinsurance brokers.

Imports must be registered in the import subsystem of the Integrated Foreign Trade System (SISCOMEX/IMPORT), which allows importers, carriers, banks, and brokers to register the various stages of an import process directly through the interlinked computers of the SECEX, customs, and the CBB. Imports are grouped into the following three categories: (1) imports that do not require automatic licenses, (2) imports that are subject to automatic import licenses, and (3) prohibited imports. Federal ministries and subordinate agencies and public enterprises are required to submit for approval an annual investment program specifying their expected import requirements. There is a simplified arrangement for foreign exchange transactions related to imports of small amounts. These are required for imports originating or proceeding from countries under restrictions determined by the UN Security Council. Drafts or LCs must be settled on maturity against the presentation of the appropriate documents by the importer. Exchange contracts for imports financed under LCs must be closed on the date of settlement or two working days before the maturity date of the LCs. In general, imports are exempt from prior approval requirements. However, some imports require prior approval (i.e., an import license) from the SECEX or other government agency. This approval is promptly given to importers whenever the licensing requirements are fulfilled. As a rule, licenses are valid for 60 days, except for imports of custom-made capital goods. The Secretariat of Federal Revenue issues clearance certificates for certain groups of commodities to special bonded warehouse importers. Import licenses for a number of specified imports may be obtained after the commodities have been landed and customs clearance obtained. The importation of certain products requires approval of the Ministry of Science and Technology. For some products, eligibility for exemption from import duties may be precluded by the existence of a satisfactory domestic equivalent. Imports of agrochemical products not authorized under Brazilian regulations; weapons; and certain drugs that are not licensed for reasons of security, health, or morals are prohibited. In addition to imports under Brazilian concessions covered by the LAIA agreement, goods imported through the Manaus and Tabatinga free zones are subject to an annual quota. Foreign goods up to the equivalent of US$2,000 imported into the Manaus free trade zone may be transferred to other parts of Brazil (as a passenger’s baggage) free of import taxes. The tariff rate on imports of toys is 20% plus a possible safeguard extension of 9% for 2005 and 8% for 2006. Sanitation and measurement requirements must be observed. The MERCOSUR Customs Union agreement stipulates a CET ranging from zero to 20%, though higher rates may be exceptionally applied in particular cases, such as 53 products pertaining to the automotive sector, on which a rate of 35% applies. Additionally, the MERCOSUR countries have approved the use of temporary national tariff exceptions, according to which Brazil exempts from the CET 100 tariff lines until December 31, 2005. Exemptions for 302 tariff lines pertaining to information and technology goods will expire on the same date. Foreign exchange transactions related to imports of goods are exempt from the tax on financial operations, and foreign exchange transactions related to imports of services have a tariff of zero. Imports of petroleum and derivatives are subject to prior disclosure from the National Petroleum Agency.

Exports of wild animals and their hides, hair, feathers, or eggs in any form; jacaranda-da- Bahia wood; ipecacuanha plants; amber and white varieties of honey; and antiques older than 100 years are prohibited. Exports of certain goods require prior approval of the SECEX, including those effected through bilateral accounts, exports without exchange cover, exports on consignment, reexports, and exports requiring prior authorization from government agencies. The SISCOMEX integrates the activities related to the registration, monitoring, and control of foreign trade operations into a single computerized flow of information. The SISCOMEX comprises two subsystems (exports and imports). The exports subsystem allows exporters, carriers, banks, and brokers to register the various stages of an export process directly through the interlinked computers of the SECEX, customs, and the CBB. Exports of sawed or cut pine woods, mahogany, Brazilian walnut, and virola are subject to quotas. For exports of ethyl alcohol and sugar in any form, including sugarcane syrup unsuitable for human consumption, the eligibility for exemption from the export tax of 40% is subject to quotas on the basis of an annual quantity exceeding domestic necessity authorized by the Industry, Trade, and Tourism Minister and the MOF. An annual quota is in place for imports under Brazilian concessions, subject to quotas due to agreements with the LAIA member countries and for goods imported into the Manaus and Tabatinga free zones. Foreign goods up to the equivalent of US$2,000 imported into the Manaus free trade zone may be transferred to other parts of Brazil (as a passenger’s baggage) free of import taxes. In general, exports are exempt from export taxes or are subject to a tax of zero. However, export duty applies to the following: (1) cashew nuts with husk, 30% whenever the amount of exports exceed 10,000 tons; (2) fume products exported to Paraguay and Uruguay, 105%; (3) cigarettes to Central America, the Caribbean, and South America, 150%; (4) raw hides, 9%; (5) tanned leather and skins, 7% for 2005 and 4% for 2006; (6) cylinders for cigarette filters to Central America, the Caribbean, and South America (except Argentina, Chile, and Ecuador), 105%; and (7) weapons and ammunition to Central America, the Caribbean, and South America (except Argentina, Chile, and Ecuador), 150%.

Under the terms of a 1967 Currency Interchangeability Agreement (CIA) between the BCMB and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the Singapore dollar is customary tender in Brunei Darussalam and the Brunei dollar in Singapore. The BCMB and MAS have accepted each other’s currency and have agreed to mutual exchange at par and without charge. They have instructed their banks to do the same with their customers. Any excess Brunei or Singapore currency is repatriated regularly, with the issuing institution bearing the costs, and settlements are made in the other country’s currency. The BCMB deals only in Singapore dollars and does not quote rates for other currencies. Banks, however, are free to deal in all currencies, with no restrictions on amount, maturity, or type of transaction. The Brunei Association of Banks fixes daily buying and selling rates for electronic transfers and sight drafts in 17 other currencies on the basis of the interbank quotations for these currencies in relation to the Singapore dollar. Banks in Brunei Darussalam must apply these rates for transactions with the general public for amounts up to B$100,000.

Unitary. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris foreign exchange market vis-à-vis the euro. Effective April 1, 2005, a symmetrical bank commission of 0.3% (previously, 0.25%) applies to transfers to all countries outside the WAEMU. The proceeds of this commission must be surrendered in its entirety to the treasury. In addition, banks are allowed to charge an exchange commission of up to 2% on over-the-counter exchange for euros. No. Residents are authorized to contract forward exchange cover to effect payments related to imports and exports of goods and services. Arrangements for Payments and Receipts Burkina Faso is linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account; therefore, settlements with France, Monaco, and other Operations Account countries (WAEMU and CAEMC members and the Comoros) are made in CFA francs, euros, or the currency of any other Operations Account country. Certain settlements are channeled through special accounts. Settlements with all other countries are usually effected through correspondent banks in France in the currencies of those countries or in euros through foreign accounts in euros. Residents must surrender all foreign exchange earned abroad or domestically to an authorized intermediary bank within eight days of receipt. Yes. An Operations Account is maintained with the French Treasury that links Operations Account countries. All purchases or sales of foreign currencies or euros against CFA francs are ultimately settled through a debit or credit to the Operations Account. A multilateral clearing agreement exists between the WAEMU members and Cape Verde, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. Exchange control is administered jointly by the MOF and the BCEAO. Most of the authority to supervise foreign exchange transactions is delegated to authorized banks, which are required to report these operations to the MOF. The only operations that require prior approval from the MOF or the BCEAO involve residents’ investments abroad, domestic accounts in foreign exchange, and resident accounts abroad. The BCEAO is also authorized to collect—either directly or through banks, financial institutions, the postal administration, or judicial agents—any information necessary to compile balance of payments statistics. 172 ©International Monetary Fund.

Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Exports of gold have been liberalized. The exportation of CFA franc banknotes by nonresident travelers is not prohibited. However, repurchases by the BCEAO of exported banknotes are suspended. In addition, shipments of BCEAO banknotes among authorized intermediaries and their correspondents situated outside the WAEMU are officially prohibited. The reexportation of foreign banknotes by nonresident travelers is allowed up to the equivalent of CFAF 500,000; the reexportation of foreign banknotes above this ceiling requires documentation demonstrating either the importation of the foreign banknotes or their purchase against other means of payment registered in the name of the traveler or through the use of nonresident deposit accounts in local banks. There are no restrictions on the importation by resident or nonresident travelers of banknotes and coins issued by the BCEAO. Residents and nonresidents may bring in any amount of foreign banknotes and coins (except gold coins) of countries outside the Operations Account area. Residents bringing in foreign banknotes and foreign currency traveler’s checks exceeding the equivalent of CFAF 300,000 must declare them to customs upon entry and sell them to an authorized intermediary bank within eight days.

Unitary. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange transactions in euros between the BEAC and commercial banks take place at this rate. Buying and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also set officially on the basis of the fixed rate for the euro and the rates for the other currencies concerned in the Paris exchange market. Commercial banks collect commissions at a rate they each set freely. However, such commissions are not levied on the following: (1) government exchange transactions, (2) transfers linked to import settlements covered by import declarations by domicile banks, (3) payments due on debt regularly contracted, (4) travel allowances, and (5) representation expenses during official missions.

Previously, imports of foreign exchange by ADs were subject to a stamp duty of 0.01% of face value; the duty did not apply to imports by the BEAC. No. Yes. Arrangements for Payments and Receipts Because Cameroon is linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account, settlements with France, Monaco, and other Operations Account countries (WAEMU and CAEMC members and the Comoros) are made in CFA francs, euros, or the currency of any other Operations Account country. Settlements with all other countries are usually made through correspondent banks in France in the currency of these countries or in euros through foreign exchange accounts denominated in euros. An Operations Account is maintained with the French Treasury that links all Operations Account countries. All purchases and sales of foreign currencies and euros against CFA francs are ultimately settled through a debit or credit to the Operations Account. Exchange regulations of CAEMC member countries are harmonized. There are clearing arrangements in the framework of the CEEAC. Exchange control is administered by the Directorate of Financial Cooperation, Money, and Insurance, in the Ministry of Finance and Budget (MOFB), which delegates its authority to authorized intermediaries. The BEAC monitors exchange regulations, evaluates foreign exchange risk coverage, approves the opening of resident foreign exchange accounts, and monitors the repatriation of export proceeds. Authorized intermediaries verify that transactions conform to regulations, and collect statistics and applicable taxes. On May 30, 2005, Cameroon notified the IMF that financial transactions by individuals and organizations associated with terrorism were restricted and blocked, in accordance with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and pursuant to the list of terrorist organizations maintained by the U.S. State Department. 190 ©International Monetary Fund.

Effective January 1, 2005, import controls imposed under the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing no longer apply because of the agreement’s expiration. As a result of the commitments made under the Uruguay Round Agreement, Canada replaced all agricultural import restrictions with tariff rate quotas to ensure import access levels as negotiated in the Uruguay Round (or under the NAFTA). Measures consistent with international trade obligations (e.g., countervailing duties) are in effect. Antidumping duties are imposed, taking into consideration competition policy factors as well as other economic costs. On average, import tariff rates are low. The highest tariff rates are applied to over-quota, supply-managed agricultural products. Certain monopolies exist at the federal level. ©International Monetary Fund.

The Export Control List identifies all goods that are controlled in order to implement intergovernmental arrangements, maintain supplies, or ensure security. It includes all items identified in the International Munitions List, the International Dual Use List, and the International Atomic Energy List. In addition, controls are maintained for supply reasons to ensure the orderly export marketing of certain products that are subject to import limitations by other countries; to promote further processing in Canada (e.g., of logs and herring roe); and for nonproliferation purposes (i.e., chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons and their delivery systems). The Area Control List includes a limited number of countries to which all exports are controlled. At present, Myanmar is on the Area Control List. Permits are required for the exportation of listed goods to all countries except, in most cases, the United States, as well as for all goods destined to countries on the Area Control List, unless otherwise exempted.

In addition, under provisions of the Investment Canada Act (ICA), new foreign investments are generally subject to notification requirements but not to review requirements. Except in sensitive sectors, where the non-Canadian investor or vendor is ultimately subject to the legislation of a WTO country other than Canada, only direct acquisitions of control of a Canadian business that has assets equal to or greater than Can$223 million are subject to review. This amount is adjusted annually to reflect economic growth in Canada. The acquisition of control of a Canadian enterprise is considered direct investment when it involves the acquisition of control of a corporation conducting business in Canada. It is considered indirect investment when it involves the transfer of control by share acquisition of a non-Canadian corporation that controls a Canadian corporation conducting business in Canada. These provisions were multilateralized as part of Canada’s implementation of the Uruguay Round. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CANADA 201 Different thresholds apply in the case of investments made by non-WTO investors and in culturally sensitive sectors. Canada applies a “net benefit” test to determine whether a proposed investment will provide economic benefits domestically. Where the non- Canadian investor and vendor are ultimately subject to the legislation of a non-WTO country, the direct acquisition of control of a Canadian business that has assets greater than Can$5 million or the indirect acquisition of control of a Canadian business with assets greater than Can$50 million (or Can$5 million if 50% or more of the total assets of the business acquired are located in Canada) is subject to review. The acquisition of a Canadian business involved in cultural industries, financial services, transportation services, or uranium production is subject to a limit of Can$5 million regardless of the nationality of the investor or vendor. Acquisitions in cultural industries may be subject to review, if the government so decides. The complete list of cultural activities is contained in schedule IV of the ICA. Investments that are generally subject to review are allowed if they are likely to be of net benefit to Canada. Cases that are subject to review must be resolved within 75 days, unless the investor agrees to a longer period of time. In practice, most cases are resolved within 45 days. No. There are no controls; however, withholding taxes apply. No. Banks are generally free to make investments in financial entities, subject to approval. However, certain limitations apply to the types of commercial entities in which they may invest, both domestically and abroad. No controls are placed on the ownership of banks that specifically preclude nonresident ownership. Although the shares of large banks must remain widely held, new legislation allows fit and proper investors to own up to 20% of voting shares or 30% of any class of nonvoting shares, provided that no single shareholder or group of shareholders controls the bank.

Unitary. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange transactions in euros between the BEAC and commercial banks take place at that rate, free of commission. Buying and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also officially posted, with quotations based on the fixed rate for the euro and the rates in the Paris exchange market for the currencies concerned. A commission of 0.5%, excluding VAT, is levied on all capital transfers to countries that are not members of the BEAC, except those made for the account of the treasury and for the expenses of students. No. No. There are no forward exchange markets. However, as allowed by the fixed peg with the euro, exporters and importers may cover their position on the Paris foreign exchange market. Arrangements for Payments and Receipts Because the Central African Republic is linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account, settlements with France, Monaco, and other Operations Account countries (WAEMU and CAEMC members and the Comoros) are made in euros or the currency of any other Operations Account country. Settlements with all other countries are usually made in the currencies of those countries or in euros. An Operations Account is maintained with the French Treasury that links Operations Account countries. All purchases and sales of foreign currencies and euros against CFA francs are ultimately settled through a debit or credit to the Operations Account. Exchange regulations of member countries in the CAEMC are harmonized. All draft legislation, directives, correspondence, and contracts having a direct or indirect bearing on the finances of the state require the prior approval of the Ministry for the Economy, Finance, Planning, and International Cooperation (MEFPIC). The Debt Directorate of the MEFPIC supervises borrowing abroad. The Office of Foreign Financial Relations of the same ministry supervises (1) lending abroad; (2) the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in the Central African Republic; and (3) inward and outward direct investment. Exchange control is administered by the MEFPIC, which has delegated some approval authority to the BEAC (i.e., control over the external position of the banks, granting of exceptional travel allocations in excess of the basic allowances, and control over the repatriation of net export proceeds), to authorized banks, and to the Postal Administration. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through authorized banks.

The currency unit is the yuan. Unitary. The exchange rate of the renminbi is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), which is managed by the People’s Bank of China (PBC), announces a benchmark rate for the renminbi against the Hong Kong dollar, the U.S. dollar, the euro, and the yen, based on the weighted average exchange rate that prevailed in foreign exchange transactions on the previous day. In the interbank foreign exchange market, daily changes in the value of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar are limited to 0.3% on either side of the benchmark rate announced by the PBC. The daily movement of the renminbi against the euro, the Hong Kong dollar, and the yen is limited to 1% on either side of the benchmark rate. If special circumstances require that these limits be exceeded, the matter should be reported to the SAFE. The U.S. dollar spot exchange bid-offer rate between designated foreign exchange banks and their customers may not exceed 0.17% of the benchmark rate, and those for Hong Kong dollars, yen, and euros may not exceed 1% of the benchmark rate on either side; under specific circumstances, these limits may be exceeded, subject to SAFE notification. Banks may set limits on the fluctuations of other currencies on their own, but the bid-offer spread may not exceed 0.5%. The selling rate for cash and the spot exchange rate must be the same for all currencies. The spot buying rate for Hong Kong dollars, Macao patacas, and U.S. dollars may not exceed 0.75% of the mid-rate for the spot exchange bid-offer rate, and the spot buying rate for euros and yen must not exceed 1% of the mid-rate for the spot exchange bid-offer rate. The cash spot buying rate for other currencies in cash may not exceed 2.5% of the mid-rate for the spot exchange bid-offer rate. Effective July 21, 2005, the PBC announced that the renminbi would be revalued to RMB 8.11 per US$1 and that the exchange rate of the renminbi will be determined with reference to an undisclosed basket of currencies. Daily fluctuations in the renminbi-U.S. dollar exchange rate will remain limited, as before, to ±0.3% around a central rate set by the PBC based on the market closing rate of the previous day.

The monetary base includes the amount of notes and coins issued, the balance of clearing accounts of banks held with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) (i.e., the aggregate balance), and the outstanding amount of exchange fund bills and notes. Operating under the rule-based currency board system, the HKMA has undertaken to issue additional exchange fund paper only when there is an inflow of funds, but the size of the program is allowed to expand along with the interest payments on such papers. The issue and redemption of Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide backing for banknotes issued by the note-issuing banks, are required to be made against U.S. dollars at the fixed exchange rate of HK$7.80 per US$1. The issue and withdrawal of coins and government-issued notes are settled against the U.S. dollar at the same fixed rate. Effective May 18, 2005, the HKMA established a trading band of HK$7.75 to HK$7.85 per US$1.

For subsidiaries of foreign banks, when the parent bank consolidates the foreign exchange risk on a global basis and for which there is adequate home supervision, the HKMA may accept higher limits. For branches of foreign banks, the foreign exchange limits are monitored by their head offices and home supervisory authorities. The HKMA will assess the expertise of any branch that has an aggregate overnight limit that appears large, i.e., in excess of 5% of the relevant bank’s capital base. In addition to these limits, locally incorporated institutions are required to provide regulatory capital for foreign exchange risk such that their adjusted capital adequacy ratio (incorporating market risk) is above the respective statutory minimum ratios.

The Central Bank of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (BCC) publishes the daily exchange rate, which is based on the combined average of the amounts and rates applied in transactions, as reported by exchange bureaus and banks. The BCC, while observing the international reserves target in the monetary program, intervenes to smooth exchange rate fluctuations, but not against market fundamentals. Charges or commissions are not assessed on interbank market transactions. In their transactions with customers, commercial banks and financial institutions may charge an exchange commission not exceeding 1%. The spread between the buying and selling rates for foreign banknotes set by the commercial banks and financial institutions in the foreign exchange market must not exceed 5%. A charge of 0.2% is levied on any exchange operation of licensed banks. No. Exchange market participants may engage in spot or forward operations. Forward operations are completed upon contract maturity. Congo franc equivalents for exchange transactions are calculated at rates agreed between contracting parties. They are paid on the agreed date and, by choice of the contracting parties, through the clearing house, credit to an account, or cash payment. The contractual maturity of forward operations must take account of holidays in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and abroad. Arrangements for Payments and Receipts Transactions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo may be expressed and carried out in domestic currency, or in one of nine currencies and units of account listed by the BCC. There are no restrictions on the holding of foreign currency. The provision of services can be valued and remunerated in either domestic or foreign currency. However, residential rent, education, health-related expenditures, and the costs of water and electricity consumption are set and paid only in domestic currency when they relate to transactions between residents. There is an inoperative agreement with Zimbabwe. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is a member of the COMESA, SADC, CEPGL, and CEEAC. In the CEPGL context, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has concluded agreements for payments using the clearing mechanism.

Forward exchange cover must be denominated in the currency of settlement prescribed in the contracts. Arrangements for Payments and Receipts Because the Republic of Congo is linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account, settlements with France, Monaco, and other Operations Account countries (WAEMU and CAEMC members and the Comoros) are made in CFA francs, euros, or the currency of any other Operations Account country. Settlements with all other countries are usually made in any of the currencies of those countries or in euros through foreign accounts in CFA francs. An Operations Account is maintained with the French Treasury. All purchases or sales of foreign currencies or euros against CFA francs are ultimately settled through a debit or credit to the Operations Account. Exchange regulations of member countries in the CAEMC are harmonized. Yes. Payments to CAEMC countries are unrestricted. Settlements and investment transactions with all other foreign countries, however, are subject to control. The General Directorate of Credit and Financial Relations (DGCRF) in the Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Budget (MEFB) supervises borrowing and lending abroad. Exchange control is administered by the MEFB, which has delegated approval authority to the DGCRF. All exchange transactions with foreign countries must be effected through authorized intermediaries. 259 Exchange tax Exchange subsidy Forward exchange market Prescription of currency requirements Payments arrangements Regional arrangements Clearing agreements Administration of control ©International Monetary Fund.

The prior authorization of the MEFB is required to import or export gold in any form. Exempt from the authorization requirement are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the treasury or the BEAC and (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a small quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles). Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. There are no official exports of gold. There is no limit on the amount of banknotes that residents or nonresidents may export from any member country of the BEAC area, but exports of banknotes outside the CAEMC area are prohibited. However, a limit of CFAF 100,000 is granted to resident travelers on their departure and arrival. Residents traveling for tourist or business purposes to France or the Operations Account countries are allowed to take out an unlimited amount in banknotes or other payment instruments in euros. The reexportation of foreign banknotes is allowed up to the amount declared at the time of entry; the reexportation of foreign banknotes exceeding this limit requires documentation demonstrating either the importation of foreign banknotes or their purchase against other means of payment registered in the name of the traveler, or through the use of nonresident deposits lodged in local banks. The reexportation by nonresident travelers of means of payment other than banknotes issued abroad and registered in the name of the nonresident traveler is not restricted, subject to documentation that these had been purchased with funds drawn from a foreign account in CFA francs or with other foreign exchange. There is no limit on the amount of banknotes that residents and nonresidents may import from a member country of the BEAC. However, imports of banknotes from outside the BEAC are prohibited.

Unitary. The external value of the colón is determined in the interbank market. Foreign exchange trading occurs in the organized electronic foreign exchange market (MONED) among authorized traders, where the Central Bank (CB) carries out its intervention operations. Foreign exchange trading also takes place directly among authorized institutions outside the MONED. Government and public sector institutions conduct foreign exchange transactions with the state commercial banks and the CB at the official reference exchange rate, which is calculated at the close of each business day as the weighted average of the exchange rates used in the market during the previous business day; the rate of crawl is adjusted on the basis of the differential between the rates of inflation in Costa Rica and in its main trading partners. During 2004, the annual rate of crawl was 9.6%. A tax, calculated as the average daily spread between buying and selling rates multiplied by the transaction amount, is applied to all transactions in the exchange market.

Unitary. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at a fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market vis-à-vis the euro. Authorized banks charge a proportional commission of 0.25% on transfers to all countries outside the WAEMU, which must be surrendered to the treasury, and a fixed commission, which they may set freely. Banks are authorized to charge a maximum commission of 2% on nonelectronic exchange transactions in euros. No. Residents are authorized to contract foreign exchange cover to settle payments related to imports and exports of goods and services.

Settlements outside the Operations Account area are allowed freely for current account transactions. Capital transactions are subject to exchange authorization (which must be filed with the Ministry of State, Ministry of Economy and Finance— MSMEF), except in the following cases: (1) transfers of the amounts required for contractual settlements of debts or for repayments of short-term loans granted for financing commercial and industrial operations; (2) transfers of proceeds from the liquidation of investments or the sale of foreign securities by nonresidents; and (3) payments for purchases of options. The CFA franc is the only legal tender and use of foreign exchange among residents is not permitted. An Operations Account is maintained with the French Treasury that links Operations Account countries. Most purchases or sales of foreign currencies or euros against CFA francs are ultimately settled through a debit or credit to the Operations Account. A clearing agreement exists among the WAMA members and Cape Verde, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. Exchange control is administered jointly by the Directorate of the Treasury in the MSMEF and the BCEAO. Since the regulations governing external financial relations of WAEMU member countries came into force (on February 1,1999), most of the supervisory authority has been delegated to authorized intermediary banks, which are required to report on the transactions carried out under their supervision.

The export of CFA franc banknotes by travelers is allowed. However, repurchase of exported banknotes by the BCEAO remains suspended. The shipment of BCEAO banknotes between authorized banks and their correspondents located outside the WAEMU zone is strictly prohibited. The reexportation of foreign banknotes by nonresident travelers is allowed up to the equivalent of CFAF 500,000; the reexportation of foreign banknotes above this ceiling requires documentation demonstrating either the importation of the foreign banknotes or their purchase against other means of payment registered in the name of the traveler or through the use of nonresident deposits at local banks. Residents traveling outside the BCEAO zone are allowed to take out foreign currency up to the equivalent of CFAF 2 million a person. Larger amounts may be exported in the form of traveler’s checks, bank drafts, or other means of payment. Imports of domestic currency by resident travelers are permitted freely.

All investments abroad by residents require prior MSMEF authorization, and at least 75% of the financing of such investments must be effected by borrowing from abroad. Transfers of capital abroad are subject to controls. In accordance with the new direction of economic policy aimed at attracting foreign investment, foreign exchange laws currently in force in WAEMU member countries do not control capital inflows. Under the new foreign exchange laws, the term “foreigner” refers to countries that are not members of the CFA franc zone. However, with respect to the local issue and offer for sale of foreign securities, the term “foreigner” means all countries outside the territory of the member country concerned. With the exception of the issue and sale of foreign securities in Côte d’Ivoire, operations in securities are not covered explicitly by specific laws. By their nature, however, these operations are still subject to the provisions governing foreign investment and lending. There are no controls on transfers related to the sale of foreign securities by residents and to the proceeds of disinvestments by nonresidents. Foreign investments in WAEMU countries are subject to reporting for statistical purposes. The prior authorization of the RCPSFM is required for the issuance and marketing of securities and capital assets of foreign entities, as well as for publicity and advertising of investments abroad.

Settlement of securities transactions by transfer abroad or by credit to a nonresident account requires an exchange authorization to be submitted to the MSMEF for approval, accompanied by supporting documentation. These purchases and the transfer abroad of funds associated with them require the prior authorization of the MSMEF. Residents may sell local corporate securities abroad. If these operations result in foreign control of Ivoirien corporations, foreign investors are required to make a prior declaration to the MSMEF. The sale of securities to liquidate an investment abroad is subject to prior declaration to the MSMEF. The proceeds in foreign exchange from the sale or liquidation must be surrendered to an authorized intermediary bank. Residents may also issue securities abroad, except for those constituting a loan. Issuance of the latter to nonresidents must be made through an authorized bank and must be reported to the MSMEF for statistical purposes. The regulations governing shares or other securities of a participating nature apply. Nonresidents may acquire money market instruments through local banks.

On January 1, 2004, the process of unifying the foreign exchange market was completed. The reference rate used by the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (CBDR) for its operations is set as the weighted average of daily rates reported by authorized exchange intermediaries. Previously, there were three exchange rates: the official exchange rate set by the CBDR, the rate used by commercial banks for foreign exchange transactions with the public, and the extrabank market rate used by exchange houses. All private sector transactions were settled at the market rate. In January 2004, the authorities unified the exchange rate market and ceased their policy of intervening in the foreign exchange market to manage the exchange rate. Intervention is geared instead to attaining the goals of monetary policy and to preventing undue exchange rate volatility. As a result, effective January 31, 2004, the exchange rate arrangement of the Dominican Republic has been reclassified to the category independently floating from the category managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate.

Exchange Arrangement The currency of Equatorial Guinea is the CFA franc. Unitary. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange transactions in euros between the BEAC and commercial banks take place at the same rate. Buying and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also officially posted, with quotations based on the fixed rate for the euro and the rates for the currencies concerned in the Paris exchange market. A commission of 0.5%, excluding VAT, is levied on transfers to countries that are not members of the BEAC. This commission is not levied on transfers relating to central and local government operations, payments for imports covered by a duly issued license and domiciled with a bank, scheduled repayments on loans properly contracted abroad, travel allowances paid by the government and its agencies for official missions, and payments of insurance premiums. No. No. No. Arrangements for Payments and Receipts Because Equatorial Guinea is linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account, settlements with France, Monaco, and other Operations Account countries (WAEMU and CAEMC members and the Comoros) are made freely in CFA francs, euros, or the currency of any other Operations Account country. Settlements with all other countries are usually made through correspondent banks in France in the currencies of those countries or in euros through foreign accounts. Since September 1993, the BEAC has suspended the repurchase of its bank notes circulating outside the territories of the CFA franc zone.

Newly mined gold must be declared to the Ministry of Mining (MM), which authorizes either its exportation or its sale in the domestic market. Imports or exports of gold from or to countries outside the CAEMC are subject to authorization by the MM. Exports are allowed only to France and countries that maintain an Operations Account with the French Treasury. Exports of gold to other countries require prior authorization from the MM. Exempt from the requirement of MM authorization are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, and (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a small quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles). Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Residents traveling for tourism or business purposes to countries in the CFA franc zone are allowed to take out BEAC banknotes in unlimited amounts. All travelers crossing the CAEMC border must declare to customs all foreign exchange and securities exceeding the equivalent of CFAF 1 million. Residents may reexport foreign banknotes up to the amount declared at the time of entry; the reexport of foreign banknotes above this ceiling requires documentation demonstrating their origin. Resident travelers may take with them foreign exchange without authorization, according to preestablished schedules based on the reason for travel; amounts in excess of the schedule require authorization. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of banknotes and coins issued by the BEAC, the Bank of France, the ECB, or any bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign banknotes and coins (except gold coins) of countries outside the Operations Account area.

Exchange transactions in euros between the BEAC and commercial banks take place at the same rate. Buying and selling rates for certain foreign currencies are also officially posted, with quotations based on the fixed rate for the euro and the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market, and include a commission. Commissions are levied at the rate of 0.5% on transfers made by the banks for their own accounts and on all private capital transfers to countries that are not members of the BEAC, except those made for the account of the treasury, national accounting offices, and private entities granted exemption by the Ministry of Economy, Finance, Budget, and Privatization (MEFBP) because of the nature of their activities.

Previously (between end-July 2004 and mid-January 2005) the official exchange rate was determined in weekly foreign exchange auctions managed by the CBRG. Guinea participates in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which limits the fluctuations of the Guinean franc to ±15% around a central rate vis-à-vis the dollar.

Certain settlements are channeled through special accounts. Settlements with all other countries are usually effected either through correspondent banks in France in the currencies of those countries or in euros through foreign accounts in euros. Yes. An Operations Account maintained with the French Treasury links Operations Account countries. All purchases or sales of foreign currencies or euros against CFA francs are ultimately settled through a debit or credit to the Operations Account. A multilateral clearing agreement exists within the WAMA, between the WAEMU members and Cape Verde, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. Exchange control is administered by the Directorate of the Treasury in the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF). The approval authority for exchange control (except for imports and exports of gold, forward exchange cover, and the opening of external accounts in foreign currency) has been delegated to the BCEAO, which also is authorized to collect—either directly or through banks, financial institutions, the postal administration, or government officials—any information necessary to compile the balance of payments statistics. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through authorized banks, the postal administration, or the BCEAO. Settlements with a country outside the Operations Account area must be formally approved by the customs administration.

The exportation of CFA franc banknotes by nonresident travelers is not prohibited; however, repurchases by the BCEAO of exported banknotes are suspended. In addition, shipments of BCEAO banknotes between authorized intermediaries and their correspondents situated outside the WAEMU are officially prohibited. The reexportation of foreign banknotes by nonresident travelers is allowed up to the equivalent of CFAF 500,000; the reexportation of foreign banknotes above this ceiling requires documentation demonstrating either the importation of the foreign banknotes or their purchase against other means of payment registered in the name of the traveler or through the use of nonresident deposits held in local banks. Residents traveling to non- WAEMU countries may carry up to the equivalent of CFAF 2 million in foreign currency a person. Amounts above this limit may be carried in the form of traveler’s checks or other means of payment. Residents and nonresidents may bring in any amount of foreign banknotes and coins (except gold coins) of countries outside the Operations Account area. Residents bringing in foreign banknotes and foreign currency traveler’s checks exceeding the equivalent of CFAF 300,000 must declare them to customs upon entry and sell them to an authorized intermediary bank within eight days of their return.

Status Under IMF Articles of Agreement Currency Exchange rate structure Classification Crawling peg Exchange tax Exchange subsidy Forward exchange market Prescription of currency requirements Use of foreign exchange among residents Payments arrangements Bilateral payments arrangements Inoperative Regional arrangements Exchange Arrangement The currency of Honduras is the Honduran lempira. Unitary. The exchange rate of the lempira is determined in foreign exchange auctions. Banks and exchange houses are required to sell all of their daily foreign exchange purchases to the Central Bank of Honduras (CBH). Participants in auctions (banks, exchange houses, and private individuals) bid at a price that may not differ from the base price set by the CBH by more than ±7%. The base exchange rate is adjusted every five auctions by the CBH in accordance with the inflation differential between Honduras and its main trading partners and the exchange rates of its main trading partners’ currencies vis-à-vis the dollar. The amount of foreign exchange offered at each auction must be at least 60% of the CBH’s purchase of foreign exchange from its agents. The minimum amount of foreign exchange to be offered and the base price are announced before the auction. Individuals wishing to purchase foreign exchange must make offers in lempiras for amounts ranging between $5,000 and $300,000 or the equivalent. Foreign exchange agents may make purchases for their own accounts to meet private demands of less than the equivalent of $5,000; the maximum amount of foreign exchange that may be purchased for this purpose is $50,000 or its equivalent for commercial banks and $15,000 for foreign exchange houses. Foreign exchange agents may charge up to 1.5% commission on sales to the public of less than $5,000 or its equivalent and up to 1.2% for larger sales. Because the authorities are maintaining a policy of satisfying every admissible bid within the band, the exchange rate is effectively pegged at the most appreciated side of the band. As a result, the exchange regime has been reclassified, effective January 1, 2004, to the category crawling peg from the category exchange rate within crawling band.

Unitary. The exchange rate of the rupee is determined in the interbank market. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which intervenes periodically in the interbank market, purchases and sells spot and forward U.S. dollars from and to ADs in the interbank market at the market exchange rate. No. No. ADs are allowed to deal forward in any permitted currency. The RBI may enter into swap transactions with ADs, under which it buys or sells spot U.S. dollars and sells or buys forward dollars for maturities available in the market. A resident may enter into forward contracts with ADs to hedge against exchange risks. Forward contracts of importers and exporters booked and outstanding must not exceed at any point in time 100% of the eligible limit, provided that any amount in excess of 25% of the eligible limit shall be only on a deliverable basis. The eligible limit is defined as the last three years’ average of import or export turnover, or the previous year’s turnover, whichever is higher. A resident with an underlying contract may enter into a forward contract with an AD in India to hedge exposure to exchange risk to the full extent of such a contract. ADs may provide forward exchange cover to foreign institutional investors (FIIs) up to the full extent of their investments in debt instruments and equities. FIIs may hedge the entire market value of their investments in equities. ADs may also provide forward cover not exceeding six months to foreign direct investors to hedge their currency risk arising from proposed direct investments in India after ensuring that the foreign entity involved has completed all formalities and obtained the necessary approvals (where applicable) for the investment in India. Nonresident Indians (NRIs) may enter into forward contracts with ADs to hedge the amount of dividends due them or the balances held in their foreign currency nonresident (FCNR) accounts or nonresident external (NRE) accounts. They are also eligible to have forward cover with respect to their investments in portfolio investment schemes. ADs may offer plain vanilla European forward options to customers who have genuine foreign currency exposures. All conditions applicable for booking, rolling over, and canceling forward contracts are applicable to options contracts. Only one hedge transaction can be booked against a particular exposure or part thereof for a given time period. Options contracts also cannot be used to hedge contingent or derived exposures, with the exception of exposures arising from the submission of tender bids in foreign exchange. Residents with overseas direct investments in equities and loans may hedge against exchange risks arising from such investments. The Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India, Ltd. (ECGCI) provides protection against exchange fluctuation with respect to deferred receivables from the date of a bid up to 15 years after the award of a contract. Exchange cover is offered in Australian dollars, euros, Japanese yen, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, U.A.E. dirhams, and U.S. dollars. For payments specified in other convertible currencies, cover is provided at the discretion of the ECGCI. 437 ©International Monetary Fund.

For the first group, all payments for eligible current international transactions, except payments relating to travel, must be settled through the ACU arrangement. In other cases, payments may be settled in any permitted currency. Export-import transactions financed with loans from international financial institutions are settled outside the ACU mechanism. Trade settlements are made through ACU dollar accounts, which are replenished through the RBI. Payments to countries in the second group may be made in Indian rupees to the account of a resident of any of these countries or in any permitted currency, and receipts from these countries may be obtained in Indian rupees from accounts of a bank situated in any of these countries or in any permitted currency. However, special rules may apply to exports under lines of credit extended by the government of India to the governments of certain foreign countries. India is a member of the ACU. Although Bhutan and Nepal are members of the ACU, trade with Bhutan and Nepal is settled outside the ACU mechanism. Subject to permission from the Nepal Rastra Bank, Nepalese residents may import from India against payment in freely convertible currency, in addition to the existing system of payment in Indian rupees; such payments must be effected through the ACU mechanism. Transactions with all other ACU member countries are settled through ACU dollar accounts.

A commercial credit of up to six months is allowed for exports on documents-against- acceptance terms. Contracts for exports involving payments to be realized beyond the normal period of six months, or one year as the case may be, are treated as deferred payment exports. Such exports are permitted, depending on the credit terms offered, the commodity to be exported, and other related considerations. This applies for turnkey, construction, and service contracts undertaken by Indian exporters on credit terms. Under the Buyer’s Credit Scheme, the Export-Import Bank (EXIM Bank) offers credits to foreign buyers in connection with the export of capital goods and turnkey projects in India in participation with commercial banks in India. An Indian exporter may lend without restriction from the funds held in an EEFC account for trade-related purposes to an overseas importing customer against a bank guarantee. Other transactions require prior permission from the RBI. Effective April 17, 2004, trade credits up to one year for noncapital goods and less than three years for capital goods are available up to US$20 million a transaction; ADs are permitted to guarantee such trade credits. Trade credits (buyer’s credits, supplier credits or lines of credit from firms or companies) exceeding US$20 million for financing imports of goods and services for a period less than three years are considered by the RBI, subject to certain conditions. An Indian entity may lend in foreign exchange to its wholly owned subsidiary abroad. Effective February 20, 2004, Indian companies are permitted to extend foreign currency loans for personal purposes for employees of their branches outside India. The maximum amount of ECB that a corporation can engage in under the automatic route is US$500 million in a financial year. All corporations registered under the Companies Act (except banks, financial institutions, housing finance companies, and NBFCs) may borrow abroad up to the equivalent of US$20 million for loans of three to five years’ average maturity and up to US$500 million loans of more than five years’ average maturity under the automatic route without RBI approval. The borrowing with an average maturity of three to five years is subject to a maximum spread of 200 basis points over the six-month LIBOR of the currency in which the loans are raised or the applicable benchmark(s), and borrowing with more than five years’ average maturity is subject to a maximum spread of 350 basis points. ADs are allowed to give performance bonds or guarantees in favor of overseas buyers in connection with bona fide exports from India, as well as guarantees in the ordinary course of business with respect to missing documents, authenticity of signatures, and for other similar purposes. The RBI has granted general permission to agents of foreign shipping and airline companies to give guarantees on behalf of their companies with respect to any debt or other obligation—such as income tax, customs, or postage—to any central or state government agency in India. Banks are not permitted to issue a guarantee, standby LC, or a letter of comfort of undertaking on behalf of their constituents in favor of an overseas lenders, to access external commercial borrowings or financial credit. However, banks are permitted to issue the same instruments in favor of an overseas lender on behalf of their importer constituents for trade credits, i.e., buyers’ or suppliers’ credit for import of noncapital goods for up to a year and capital goods for a period of less than three years and up to US$20 million an import transaction, without prior RBI approval. The RBI has permitted ADs to grant loans to residents against guarantees from nonresidents, subject, among other things, to the condition that no direct or indirect payment is made abroad by way of guarantee, commission, or otherwise. ©International Monetary Fund.

Previously, the exchange rate of the new sheqel was managed against a basket of currencies comprising the dollar, the euro, the pound sterling, and the yen. The market exchange rate fluctuated within a crawling band in response to market forces. The upper and lower limits of the band, which had been adjusted daily, were originally derived to reflect the annual difference between the domestic inflation target and the projected inflation of the main trading partners. In the past few years, however, the practice changed, such that only the slope of the lower limit has been reduced, whenever warranted, while the upper limit has remained unchanged at a steeper slope. The slope of the upper limit has been 6% on an annual basis since July 26, 1993; the lower limit has been flat since December 23, 2001.

Status Under IMF Articles of Agreement Currency Other legal tender Exchange rate structure Classification Managed floating with no pre- determined path for the exchange rate Exchange Arrangement The currency of Jamaica is the Jamaica dollar. Commemorative gold coins in denominations of J$100 and J$500 and souvenir coins in denominations of J$5, J$10, J$25, J$50, and J$100 are legal tender but do not circulate. Unitary. The exchange rate of the Jamaica dollar is determined in the domestic foreign exchange market. This market is operated by ADs, cambios, bureaux de change, and the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ). The ADs include all commercial banks, select merchant banks, and the two largest building societies. ADs engage in (1) the purchasing and selling of foreign currency in the form of cash, drafts, traveler’s checks, and other instruments; (2) the granting of loans and the taking of deposits; and (3) the making of other international payments. Cambios are allowed to purchase and sell unlimited amounts of foreign exchange in any form to any person. However, unlike ADs, cambios are not permitted to grant loans or accept deposits. The main function of bureaux de change is the exchange of currency for hotel guests. ADs and cambios are required to sell to the BOJ a minimum of 5% and a maximum of 10% of their daily foreign exchange purchases from commercial clients, excluding purchases from ADs, cambios, and the BOJ. Excess foreign exchange may be sold without restriction to commercial banks, other ADs, and the general public. Proceeds from official loans, divestment of government assets, and taxes on the bauxite sector payable in foreign currency are sold directly to the BOJ. While there is no restriction on transactions in any currency, the principal foreign currencies accepted in the exchange market are the Canadian dollar, the pound sterling, and the U.S. dollar. Surrenders may be made in any of these three major currencies. Surrenders in Canadian dollars and pounds sterling may be made in U.S. dollars and must be covered at the cross-currency rate derived from their respective weighted-average buying rates in the local market on the day of purchase. The BOJ purchases foreign exchange from ADs and cambios under the following terms: (1) purchases are made in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, pounds sterling, and euros; (2) the minimum amount that the BOJ will purchase in a single transaction is 50,000 units of the foreign currency; and (3) the exchange rates for these currencies are negotiated by the BOJ. No. No. This market is currently inactive. Arrangements for Payments and Receipts Payments to all countries may be made by crediting Jamaica dollars to an external account or a foreign currency account. Receipts from all countries must be debited to an external account in any foreign currency. Economic agents are free to settle all transactions with domestic currency.

Unitary. The exchange rate of the tenge is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The foreign exchange market includes the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange (KASE), which conducts daily trading online using an electronic trading system, an over-the-counter interbank market, and a network of about 2,600 exchange bureaus handling foreign exchange cash transactions. Banks may participate in trading sessions on their own account or on behalf of their clients. Banks may also trade in an over-the-counter interbank market at freely negotiated rates. The official exchange rate of the tenge against the dollar is determined daily on the basis of the weighted average rate at 11:00 a.m. the previous day on the KASE. The rates for other currencies are calculated on the basis of their cross rates against the dollar. The National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) publishes daily exchange rates of certain currencies against the tenge for accounting and customs payments computation purposes. Commercial banks set their own exchange rates without restrictions. No. No. Foreign exchange futures are quoted on the KASE. Forward exchange operations are also conducted in the interbank market. Arrangements for Payments and Receipts Payments and transfers in transactions between residents must be effected only in tenge unless provided otherwise by the NBK’s regulations and tax and customs laws. Payments and transfers between residents and nonresidents may be conducted in any currency as long as they comply with the requirements of foreign exchange laws. Resident and nonresident natural persons may use foreign cash in Kazakhstan to conduct transactions through authorized banks, credit their own foreign exchange accounts, make transfers through authorized banks (including transfers not associated with accounts) in cases specified by legislation, and effect settlements of goods and services sold by residents possessing the appropriate NBK license.

Payments or transfers between residents must be effected in tenge unless provided otherwise by the NBK regulations or tax and customs laws. No. The NBK is the principal agency for foreign exchange regulation and control. The NBK (1) establishes procedures for foreign exchange transactions and monitors compliance therewith; (2) issues licenses for conducting transactions involving the use of foreign exchange assets; (3) issues licenses for conducting foreign exchange transactions with institutions that are engaged in certain types of banking operations; and (4) establishes procedures, forms, and deadlines for submitting reports pertaining to foreign exchange control and regulation. For the purpose of national economic security, the NBK has the right to impose restrictions on the form of settlement for certain export-and-import transactions and on the currency of payment in residents’ export transactions, and to introduce export proceeds surrender regime. For the purpose of fulfilling international obligations and in the event of emergencies, the president of Kazakhstan is empowered to restrict or suspend foreign exchange transactions. The MOF ensures monitoring and control over the government’s borrowing, control over the earmarked and efficient use of government-guaranteed borrowing, and monitoring of government and government-guaranteed debt. The Ministry of Industry and Trade issues licenses to import and export goods and services and to perform other activities within the scope of its authority, and it also monitors licensees’ compliance with qualification requirements and licensing regulations. The Customs Control Committee of the MOF performs customs control and, within the scope of its authority, foreign exchange control. Authorized banks and authorized institutions engaged in certain types of banking operations, and other institutions with a responsibility under their license to monitor compliance with foreign exchange legislation in the course of their transactions, are foreign exchange control agents.

Exchange Arrangement The currency of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is the Macedonian denar. Unitary. The exchange market operates at two levels: wholesale (enterprises, commercial banks, and the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (NBRM)) and retail (foreign exchange bureaus and natural persons). The NBRM participates in the wholesale market to maintain the value of the denar against the euro at a level that meets balance of payments objectives. Buying and selling rates for transactions between authorized banks and enterprises have to be reported to the NBRM, which calculates an average daily rate. Based on this rate and cross rates on the international market, the NBRM publishes rates for 12 currencies and deals at the buying and selling rates (i.e., midpoint rates plus or minus a margin of 0.5%). Foreign exchange bureaus, owned and operated by banks, enterprises, and natural persons, may hold foreign exchange in cash up to the specified maximum level, and must keep the balances above this level in a special account with the commercial banks of their preference. No. No. Forward foreign exchange operations are allowed for all residents.

An agreement is maintained with Slovenia. The NBRM controls foreign exchange operations of banks, savings institutions, foreign exchange bureaus, and the entities providing prompt money transfer services. The MOF controls foreign exchange and trade operations and credit operations of natural and juridical persons for transactions not controlled by the NBRM.

The threshold level that requires approval under the FIC guidelines is RM 10 million for the acquisition of property by a non-Bumiputera interest from a Bumiputera interest; RM 20 million for acquisition of property by a local interest. The threshold level for the acquisition of property by a foreign interest, including permanent residents, would depend on the type of property acquired with no limit on the number of properties. In addition, the permitted percentage of equity held by foreigners also depends on the percentage of production exported, whether high-technology products are purchased or priority products are produced for the domestic market. For projects involving extracting, mining, and processing mineral ores, a majority foreign equity participation of up to 100% is permitted. Companies with Multimedia Super Corridor status are allowed to have 100% foreign equity. Foreign equity holdings in manufacturing projects are allowed up to 100% for all types of investments.

Previously, credit institutions other than ADs and approved merchant banks required approval to maintain these accounts. The regulations governing financial credits apply. ADs and approved merchant banks are allowed to lend in foreign currency to residents. A resident borrower, however, must obtain prior approval if total aggregate borrowing exceeds the permitted amount, i.e., equivalent to RM 50 million for resident companies and RM 10 million for resident individuals. Purchases are allowed, provided that the issuance of the securities has been approved and the investment is subject to the net open position limits of ADs and approved merchant banks. Investment abroad by ADs and approved merchant banks is subject to net open position limits.

Insurers are required to support their margin of solvency (which is defined to include liabilities) with documented assets, as specified by the BNM. Insurance regulations allow a licensed insurer to hold for investment purposes with respect to its Malaysian insurance fund up to a maximum of 5% of its margin of solvency in assets of a foreign jurisdiction with a sovereign rating that is not lower than the sovereign rating of Malaysia. However, investment in any one foreign jurisdiction is restricted to 2% of its margin of solvency. A licensed insurer is also allowed to hold assets of a foreign jurisdiction where it is conducting business to enable it to meet its foreign liabilities in that jurisdiction. As of April 1, 2005, licensed insurers and takaful (Islamic insurance) operators may also invest abroad up to 5% of their margins of solvency and total assets, respectively. These entities may also invest up to 30% of net asset value of investment-linked funds. The guidelines on unit trust funds issued by the SC in 1997 and revised in 2003 allow unit trust schemes to include investments in foreign securities traded in or under the rules of a foreign market, although this requires prior approval from the BNM, the SC, and other relevant authorities. Effective April 1, 2005, resident unit trust management companies are allowed to invest abroad up to 30% and 100% of net asset value (NAV) attributable to resident and nonresident subscribers, respectively.

Unit trust schemes—as prescribed in the guidelines on unit trust funds—are subject to certain rules regarding diversification of assets, including limits on investments in unlisted securities, other collective investment schemes, and participation in futures contracts, warrants, and options. In addition, there are provisions concerning investment limits— including rules on investments in securities of single issuers and of groups of companies, as well as in classes of securities—to ensure that the schemes have adequate spread and concentration of investments. Under FIC guidelines, there are no controls on foreign firms trading in the corporate debt, equity, and derivative markets. However, the following require approval: (1) any proposed acquisition of 15% or more of the voting power by any one foreign interest or associated group, or foreign interests in the aggregate of 30% or more of the voting power of a Malaysian company or business; (2) acquisition of assets or interests, mergers, and takeovers of companies and businesses in Malaysia, whether by Malaysian or foreign interests; or (3) any other proposed acquisition of assets or interests exceeding RM 10 million in value, whether by Malaysians or foreign interests. Foreign incorporated companies may seek listing on MSEB subject to meeting certain criteria that looks into, among others, the level of foreign operations, level of Malaysian ownership, and the benefits gained by Malaysia.

Malta has 25 denominations of gold coins, 53 silver coins, and 3 cupronickel coins that are legal tender but do not circulate. Unitary. The exchange rate of the Maltese lira is determined on the basis of a weighted basket of currencies. The basket consists of the dollar (10%), the euro (70%), and the pound sterling (20%). A fixed spread of approximately 0.125% is applied to the middle rate to compute the buying and selling rates for transactions between the Central Bank of Malta (CBM) and credit and financial institutions. These transactions may be conducted in dollars, euros, or pounds sterling, normally in amounts of not less than the equivalent of Lm 150,000. The CBM also quotes indicative rates for other currencies based on international market rates. There is no limit on the spread between the buying and selling rates that ADs may quote in the foreign exchange market. No. No. The CBM may provide forward cover directly to government departments and public sector agencies.

Status Under IMF Articles of Agreement Currency Exchange rate structure Classification Managed floating with no pre- determined path for the exchange rate Exchange Arrangement The currency of Mauritania is the Mauritanian ouguiya. Unitary. Effective August 1, 2004, the Central Bank of Mauritania (CBM) discontinued the foreign exchange auctions held under the Extended Exchange Market (EEM) mechanism and adopted a direct intervention system accompanied by rationing of foreign exchange. Previously, the daily official exchange rate was determined in the EEM session of the previous day, and the CBM decided the extent of its intervention in the EEM based on observed and foreseeable market pressures; the reserve accumulation target; and the actual rates observed in transactions recorded in the preceding days by banks and exchange bureaus. Based on the central rate, the CBM used a fixed margin of ±0.375% to obtain bid and offer rates, which were used in all CBM foreign exchange–ouguiya transactions with the treasury. All CBM foreign exchange transactions with banks and foreign exchange bureaus were carried out in the EEM sessions. In addition to the CBM and the National Industry and Mining Society, which participated only through sell orders, the EEM was open to banks and exchange bureaus that had paid a guarantee deposit. In addition, exchange bureaus had to deposit 2.5% of the amount of any buy order exceeding the equivalent of $20,000. This deposit was paid to the counterparty if the order was accepted; otherwise, it was refunded to the exchange bureau. A bank was not allowed to buy or sell for its own account more than the equivalent of 8% of its net capital and reserves in dollars at any one session of the EEM. Banks and exchange bureaus were allowed to freely determine the bid and offer rates and commissions they used in transactions with their customers and among themselves. The average exchange rate was applied to foreign clearing transactions of the Postal Administration; this exchange rate was applied also to remittances through the Postal Administration by Mauritanian workers residing abroad. The CBM requires banks to report on a weekly basis purchases and sales of foreign exchange equivalent to $10,000 or higher. No. No. No. Arrangements for Payments and Receipts n.a. Yes.

The change in the mechanism began to apply from the May–July 2004 sales period onward. The total amount of dollars to be sold will equal 50% of the net international reserves accumulated during the previous quarter, with one-fourth of the established amount being auctioned each quarter (previously, this distribution did not apply) not including the cumulative amount of dollars sold through the auction mechanism during the same period.

Arrangements for Payments and Receipts All transactions between Morocco and foreign countries—regardless of the type of transactions—must be settled in foreign currencies that are quoted by the BAM or in convertible dirhams. Transactions among residents in Morocco must be denominated and settled in domestic currency. A regional payments arrangement among the central banks of Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia governs payment operations among those countries. Exchange control is administered by the Foreign Exchange Office (FEO), an agency under the MOF. This office has delegated the execution of the main exchange control measures to authorized banks. Import and export licenses, which are required for some products, are issued by the Department of Foreign Trade (DFT). In accordance with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, prior FEO authorization is required to conduct financial transactions with nonresident individuals or entities associated with suspected links to terrorism. Morocco maintains restrictions against certain countries pursuant to UN Security Council resolutions. No. 648 ©International Monetary Fund.

In addition to the official exchange rate, an unofficial rate is determined on an officially tolerated parallel foreign exchange market. Foreign exchange certificates (FECs) are issued by the Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM) in denominations of 1, 5, 10, and 20 units and are exchangeable with euros, yen, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, and dollars or with authorized traveler’s checks at the rate of FEC 1 per $1. FECs are widely used and serve the needs of visitors and investors in Myanmar. FECs may be exchanged for kyats at a fixed rate at FEC exchange centers. There is also an illegal parallel market that exchanges dollars with kyats at a premium over the parallel market FEC rate. Holders of FECs may open foreign currency accounts and/or deposit their FECs into their foreign exchange accounts. The kyat is officially pegged to the SDR at K 8.50847 per SDR 1 within margins of ±1%. The exchange rates of the kyat for the euro, Bangladesh taka, Indian rupee, yen, Pakistan rupee, pound sterling, Sri Lanka rupee, Swiss franc, and the dollar are determined on the basis of the daily calculations of the value of these currencies against the SDR.

There are three exchange rates: (1) the official exchange rate, which results from auctions of foreign exchange by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN); (2) the interbank market exchange rate, at which commercial banks transact among themselves using proceeds from non-oil exports and personal transfers; and (3) the exchange bureau rate. During 2004, the average premium between the exchange bureau rate and the official rate was 5.5%. The official exchange rate of the naira is determined in the twice-weekly Dutch auctions, in which banks bid on behalf of legitimate users to purchase foreign exchange from the CBN with requests supported by the required documentation. The auction is a sealed bid– multiple price system, with the marginal exchange rate being the rate that clears the market. The CBN announces the amount on offer the day before the auction, and the auction results the day after. Funds purchased from the CBN must be used for eligible transactions only, subject to stipulated documentation requirements. Such funds are not transferable in the interbank foreign exchange market. The interbank rate is freely negotiable among ADs, including commercial banks. Funds obtained through the Dutch auction system are not eligible for utilization at the interbank market. Effective January 1, 2004, Nigeria participates in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires that the spot exchange rate between the Nigerian naira and the dollar be maintained within margins of ±15% around the central rate. However, the CBN has not yet implemented these measures.

Unitary. Exchange rates are determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. However, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) acts to limit sharp fluctuations in the exchange rate and intervenes when necessary to maintain orderly conditions in the foreign exchange market. Commercial banks trade in foreign exchange through the Philippine Dealing System (PDS), an electronic screen-based network. The PDS allows trading between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. daily among Bankers Association of the Philippines member banks and the BSP. The system allows participants to electronically share information and transact business. The exchange rate of the peso vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar at the beginning of the trading day represents the weighted average of all transactions in the PDS during the preceding day. The amount of foreign exchange that may be sold over the counter without documentation and prior BSP approval is the equivalent of US$5,000. No. No. All forward contracts to sell (i.e., excluding purchases) foreign exchange to nonresidents with no full delivery of principal, including cancellations and rollovers/renewals, require prior BSP clearance. All long-term (exceeding one year) foreign exchange forward contracts and nondeliverable forward (NDF) contracts (whether with residents or nonresidents) may only be undertaken by banks with expanded derivatives licenses. The BSP authorizes the rollover, without prior approval, of short-term deliverable forward contracts with nonresidents at every maturity during the course of the underlying long-term Philippine government securities, provided that (1) the underlying transactions for each short-term deliverable foreign exchange forward contract are BSP-registered foreign investments in government securities, (2) the actual delivery or settlement of the forward contract coincides with the date of the repatriation of the BSP-registered investments, (3) the value of the forward contract does not exceed the foreign currency equivalent of the maturity value or net proceeds of the BSP-registered investments computed on the basis of the agreed forward exchange rate, (4) the repatriation and remittance out of the country of the BSP-registered investments comply with the documentary requirements under existing BSP rules, and (5) the bank concerned submits to the BSP a weekly report on forward contracts with nonresidents. The maturity of all forward contracts—i.e., outright forward and forward swap contracts to cover long-term foreign currency requirements—may not exceed six months. The maturity of foreign exchange forwards (whether deliverable or nondeliverable) and swaps (sale of foreign exchange at the first leg and purchase of foreign exchange at the second leg) must not be longer than (1) the maturity of the underlying foreign exchange obligation or (2) the approximate due date or settlement of the foreign exchange exposure. However, for foreign currency loans, the maturity of deliverable foreign exchange forwards must be coterminous with the maturity of the underlying obligation. The maturity of the above-mentioned swap contracts may not be less than 30 calendar days and not longer than (1) the maturity of the underlying foreign exchange obligation or (2) the approximate due date or settlement of the foreign exchange exposure. 752 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PHILIPPINES 753 Official cover of forward operations Through the Currency Rate Risk Protection Program (CRPP Facility), the BSP provides a mechanism for hedging the foreign exchange risk exposure of local companies by means of a NDF U.S. dollar/peso contract between the BSP and universal and commercial banks. At the maturity of the contract, only the net difference between the contracted forward rate and the prevailing spot rate is settled in pesos.

The Monetary Board of the BSP sets an annual ceiling for approvals of commercial medium- and long-term foreign loans to the public sector, as well as those to the private sector that are publicly guaranteed or intended to be serviced with foreign exchange purchased from the domestic banking system. The Monetary Board also sets a limit on the stock of short-term public sector debt. Pursuant to the Philippines Constitution and existing BSP rules, all public and private sector publicly guaranteed obligations from foreign creditors, including offshore banking units (OBUs), must be referred to the BSP for prior approval and subsequent registration. This registration of investments is required to purchase foreign exchange from the domestic banking system for the servicing of capital repatriation or outward remittance of earnings. Other private sector loans from foreign creditors, including OBUs and other financing schemes or arrangements, require prior approval and/or registration by the BSP if they are covered by any guarantee from local banks or are intended to be serviced using foreign exchange purchased from the domestic banking system. Foreign currency borrowings from foreign currency deposit units (FCDUs) with a maturity exceeding one year are governed by the same guidelines. Short-term FCDU loans, including those obtained by the public sector, do not require prior BSP approval, provided that the borrower or project qualifies for foreign financing. However, those obtained by the private sector are subject to prior BSP approval. OBUs may hold peso-denominated assets (i.e., bonds or other certificates of indebtedness, shares of stocks, and other properties) arising from restructuring or other repayment schemes of outstanding loans, subject to the terms and conditions of the approval of such schemes. Bonds or other certificates of indebtedness issued by a third party, as well as shares of stocks and other properties acquired as a result of these schemes, must be booked at their appraised value or the loan balance, whichever is lower. Shares of stocks and other properties acquired as a result of these schemes must be sold or disposed of within a period of five years from the acquisition date. Booking of bonds, other certificates of indebtedness, and shares of stock acquired must be adjusted in cases of decline in their market value, while other properties must be subject to regular provisioning within three years of the contract date.

Commercial banks, which are authorized to operate under the expanded foreign currency deposit system, may grant foreign currency loans, irrespective of maturity, to nonresidents without prior approval by the BSP. It is required that the loans are serviced using foreign exchange purchased from outside the domestic banking system, and all applicable banking rules and regulations are complied with, including all limits on lending to a single borrower, which are defined to include loans and guarantees issued to companies and their subsidiaries, affiliates, and major stockholders all over the world. To curb undue speculation in the foreign exchange market and to further reinforce the provision that peso deposits should be funded from inward foreign exchange remittances, banks are prohibited from extending peso loans to nonresidents. In the case of short-term FCDU loans, including those obtained by the private sector, no prior BSP approval is required, provided that the borrower or project qualifies for foreign financing. These short-term FCDU loans must, however, be reported by the creditor banks to the BSP to be eligible for servicing with foreign exchange purchased from the domestic banking system. Medium- and long-term FCDU loans are subject to prior approval and registration with the BSP to be eligible for servicing with foreign exchange purchased from the domestic banking system. FCDU and EFCDU funds of universal and commercial banks may lend to their regular banking unit (RBU) to fund the latter’s on–balance sheet foreign exchange trade transactions, provided that the FCDU or EFCDU has fully complied with the requirement of 100% asset cover and 30% liquidity cover on FCDU or EFCDU liabilities. FCDU and EFCDU lending to the RBU must be at prevailing market interest rates and capped at the lower of total outstanding balance on the RBU’s on–balance sheet foreign currency trade assets or 30% of the level of FCDU or EFCDU deposit liabilities, computed at the average daily balance (using two-month rolling data) as of the second week prior to the reference week; the maturity of such loans must be less than one year. Effective February 10, 2004, FCDU and EFCDU loans may be transferred to their RBU without prior BSP approval, subject to conditions that apply to such transfers.

Effective January 28, 2004, universal banks and commercial banks with expanded derivatives authority are permitted to invest in credit-linked notes (CLNs) and credit-linked deposits (CLDs). Universal banks and commercial banks without such authority may however, invest in single-name CLNs where the reference asset is a direct government obligation or an obligation fully guaranteed by the government. Investments in securities or debt instruments where the principal and revenue streams are linked to market risk factors (e.g., interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, or commodity price) may only be undertaken by banks with expanded derivatives authority. Effective January 5, 2005, EFDCUs of universal or commercial banks without expanded derivatives authority are permitted to invest, for their own account, in foreign currency– denominated structured products issued by banks and special purpose vehicles of high credit quality, provided (1) the revenue streams are linked only to interest rate indices and/or foreign exchange rates other than those that involve the peso, and (2) the minimum all-in return of such investments may not be lower than zero. ©International Monetary Fund.

Universal banks and commercial banks without expanded derivatives authority are permitted to invest only in securities overlying tranches of securitization structures that were rated at least A, or its equivalent, by a BSP-recognized credit rating agency. Effective February 6, 2004, the liquidity reserve requirement for peso demand, savings, and time deposits, and deposit-substitute liabilities of universal and commercial banks, is 10% (previously, 8%). The regular reserve requirement was maintained at 9%. As a result, the total reserve requirement applied to peso deposits and deposit-substitute liabilities of universal and commercial banks increased to 19% (previously, 17%). A reserve requirement is not applied to deposit accounts in foreign exchange. The required liquidity reserves may be maintained in the form of short-term government securities that bear market-level yields and are purchased directly from the BSP. At least 25% of the regular reserve requirement must be maintained in the form of deposits with the BSP and the remaining in the form of cash and nonnegotiable BSP-supported government securities bearing interest rate not exceeding 4%. Depository banks with FCDUs and EFCDUs must maintain at all times 100% asset cover for their foreign currency liabilities. At least 30% of the cover requirement for these liabilities must be in the form of liquid assets. The investment of a bank subsidiary in the equity of a subsidiary located abroad is subject to prior BSP approval provided that (1) the bank subsidiary meets certain prequalification and documentary requirements, and (2) the applicant parent subsidiary complies with the licensing requirements of the host country and secures the necessary license to operate. The proposed subsidiary may also invest in another subsidiary with prior BSP approval and is subject to the applicable BSP reporting, supervision, and examination requirements. Any outward investment representing initial capital and other outlays is subject to BSP regulations. At least 50% of the yearly net profits of the proposed subsidiary must be declared and paid as cash dividends to the parent subsidiary. Any additional funding or advances of the parent bank in the Philippines to its subsidiaries abroad or the subsidiary requires prior BSP approval. Foreign ownership of domestic banks is allowed up to 100%. Foreign juridical and natural persons may own 40%. However, banks that are majority foreign owned may not account for more than 30% of the total reserves of the banking system. For FCDUs of commercial banks and expanded commercial banks, at least 70% of the cover must be maintained in the same currency as the liability and up to 30% may be denominated in other acceptable foreign currencies. FCDUs of thrift banks must maintain foreign currency cover in the same currency as that of the corresponding foreign currency deposit liability. The limit on a bank’s long (overbought) foreign exchange position is 2.5% of its unimpaired capital or the equivalent of US$5 million, whichever is smaller. No limit applies on short (oversold) foreign exchange positions. Any excess above the overbought limit must be settled daily. The BSP imposes sanctions for the violation of open-position limits. No differential treatment is ascribed to resident and nonresident deposit accounts with respect to liquid asset requirements, as all depository banks within the foreign currency deposit system are required to maintain at all times a 100% asset cover for their foreign currency liabilities, of which 30% must be liquid. Yes. Except as may be authorized by the Monetary Board, total equity investments in and/or loans to any single enterprise abroad by an investment house with quasi-banking functions may not at any time exceed 15% of its net worth.

As a general rule, no securities may be sold or offered for sale to the public within the country unless such securities have been registered and are permitted to be sold by the SEC. A foreign corporation whose securities are listed and traded on a local stock exchange must designate a transfer agent and registrar in the Philippines. As a general rule, a broker, dealer, or salesperson must register with the SEC to do business in the country. Changes During 2004 February 26. The BSP began buying gold from producers in pesos on the basis of the average of live gold and silver prices quoted simultaneously between 8:00 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. by the London Bullion Market Association market-making members, excluding the highest and lowest quotes and rounding to the nearest US$0.05. February 16. The BSP registration requirements for DA and OA imports were replaced by a reporting requirement to the BSP. April 27. If at least one of the parties in the securities transaction was a bank or an NBFI under BSP supervision, securities purchased were required to be held by a BSP-accredited securities custodian or registry that must be an unaffiliated third party. However, if the purchaser was a nonresident with an existing global custody agreement governed by foreign laws and conventions wherein the bank or NBFI was designated as custodian or subcustodian, the requirement for a third party BSP-accredited custodian did not apply. January 28. Universal banks and commercial banks with expanded derivatives authority were permitted to invest in CLNs and CLDs. Universal banks and commercial banks without such authority could invest in single-name CLNs where the reference asset is a direct government obligation or an obligation fully guaranteed by the government.

The transferable ruble continues to be used as a unit of account for outstanding balances of the former CMEA. Unitary. The exchange rate of the leu is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market. Since November 2, 2004, the National Bank of Romania (NBR) limited the degree of its intervention in the foreign exchange market to allow more flexibility in the exchange rate movements. As a result, the exchange rate regime of Romania has been reclassified to the category managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate from the category crawling band. Previously, the NBR intervened in the foreign exchange market to guide the exchange rate in line with the annual inflation objective which allowed modest real appreciation of the leu vis-à-vis the euro; this policy was aimed at using the exchange rate as an implicit nominal anchor. Effective March 1, 2005, dealings in the foreign exchange market may take place without supporting documents. Credit institutions require NBR authorization to participate in the interbank market as intermediaries. Juridical persons other than authorized credit institutions may purchase or sell foreign exchange through authorized credit institutions. Natural persons may purchase or sell foreign currency either through authorized credit institutions or through foreign exchange offices authorized by the NBR. The NBR quotes rates for 17 foreign currencies based on the rates for these currencies against the euro in the countries concerned. Foreign exchange offices conduct transactions with banknotes of all the above foreign currencies and accept traveler’s checks denominated in those currencies. No. No. The forward market is not yet developed. Arrangements for Payments and Receipts Payments to and from countries with which Romania has bilateral payments arrangements are made only in convertible currencies and in accordance with the procedures set forth in those arrangements. Normally, the use of foreign exchange among residents is not permitted, except for certain categories of residents and situations. There are arrangements with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, and some former CMEA members, aimed at liquidating the balance of the CMEA accounts. There are arrangements with Albania, Algeria, Costa Rica, Egypt, and Greece. Effective April 25, 2005, Romania joined the EU.

Unitary. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at the rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market and the fixed rate between the euro and the CFA franc. Authorized banks charge an exchange commission of 2% on purchases and sales of euros and a freely determined commission on purchases and sales of foreign currencies not directly related to transactions abroad. In addition, a commission of 0.25% (all of which must be surrendered to the treasury) is levied by banks on transfers to all countries outside the WAEMU. No. Residents are authorized to contract forward exchange cover for payments related to imports and exports of goods and services. Forward cover may be contracted only in the currency of settlement stipulated in the commercial contract.

All payments related to current transactions between member countries’ banks may be effected under the clearing arrangement, except transactions specified by the committee of governors of ECOWAS countries or payments related to the exportation between members of finished products originating in countries that are not WAMA members. Exchange control is administered by the MEF, which partially delegates its approval authority to the BCEAO and to authorized banks. The Directorate of Money and Credit examines exchange authorization requests relating to nondelegated operations. Customs offices monitor outflows of foreign exchange and confirm imports and exports of goods.

Currency Exchange rate structure Classification Managed floating with no pre- determined path for the exchange rate Exchange tax Exchange subsidy Forward exchange market Exchange Arrangement The currencies of Serbia and Montenegro are the dinar in the Republic of Serbia and the euro in the Republic of Montenegro. Unitary. In the Republic of Serbia, the exchange rate of the dinar against the euro is set at the fixing session held at the inter-bank foreign exchange market on the basis of supply and demand. This rate represents the official rate of the dinar against the euro, and it applies to transactions conducted at the fixing session. The National Bank of Serbia (NBS) may intervene in the fixing session for the purpose of influencing the movement of the exchange rate. The official rate of the dinar vis-à-vis other currencies traded in the domestic foreign exchange market is determined on the basis of their cross rates vis-à-vis the euro. NBS purchases and sales of foreign exchange outside the fixing session take place within margins of ±0.3% for noncash transactions and, effective February 25, 2004, ±0.7% (previously, ±0.6%) for cash transactions. The NBS charges a commission of 0.5% on sales of foreign exchange. There is a commission of 0.15% on sales of convertible foreign currencies (banknotes), except for dollars, for which the commission is 2%. The NBS conducts trade in Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible marka, Czech koruny, Hungarian forint, Polish zlotys, and Slovenian tolars on the foreign exchange cash market, with a commission of 2.5% on purchases only. Banks are free to fix their own buying and selling rates for foreign exchange on the basis of supply and demand, but must observe the rates prevailing in the international market. Authorized banks may buy and sell foreign exchange on the interbank market outside the fixing session at mutually agreed rates, and they may set the commissions for these services freely. n.a. If exports of goods or services are contracted, and payments are made in convertible foreign currency, juridical persons are entitled to a refund of customs and other import duties, as well as to other incentive payments. For exports of goods, the calculation is based on the free Serbia and Montenegro border parity; for exports of services, the calculation is based on the amount after deduction of foreign costs. The rates applied for the refund of customs duties vary for different types of economic activities, but range from 0.4% to 4.5%. An enterprise that has collected payment for exports of merchandise is entitled to a partial refund of freight paid for rail, maritime, or air transportation from the Serbia or Montenegro border to the destination at rates ranging from 1.5% to 2.5%. Additional incentives are offered for certain agriculture and food industry exports, at rates ranging from 5% to 20%. No exchange subsidy applies in the Republic of Montenegro. Forward purchases and sales of foreign exchange are permitted, provided that their terms of delivery are more than two working days but no more than 365 days from the contract date.

Various commemorative gold coins issued on several occasions since 1976 are also legal tender. Unitary. The Seychelles rupee is pegged to a weighted basket of currencies of Seychelles’ main trading and tourism partners, with the weights as follows: the euro (37.7%), the yen (2.7%), the pound sterling (15.7%), the Singapore dollar (7.7%), the South African rand (10.5%), and the U.S. dollar (25.7%). However, the Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS) pegs de facto the rupee to the U.S. dollar at SR 5.50 per US$1 when calculations based on the basket indicate a rate that is more appreciated against the U.S. dollar. Exchange rates for various currencies are quoted on the basis of their New York closing rates for the U.S. dollar on the previous day, using the dollar rate for the Seychelles rupee as derived from the fixed parity to the currency basket or the appreciation limit of the rupee. The CBS circulates these rates daily to the commercial banks. The CBS charges a commission of 0.125% on purchases and 0.875% on sales of euros, pounds sterling, and U.S. dollars. The commercial banks are authorized to deal in pounds sterling and other currencies at rates based on the exchange rates circulated daily by the CBS. Other ADs include casinos, guest houses, hotels, restaurants, self-catering establishments, tour operators, travel agents, car rental services, boat charters, shipping agents, and ship chandlers.

Unitary. The exchange rate of the Solomon Islands dollar is determined on the basis of the value of a trade-weighted basket of the currencies of the Solomon Islands’ four major trading partners as a guide to daily variations of the parity. These variations, however, are programmed to yield modest weekly depreciations of the currency against the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, with daily variations limited to an undisclosed narrow band. The Central Bank of the Solomon Islands (CBSI) provides the commercial banks with daily limits on the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar in transactions with the CBSI and the public. Commercial banks in the Solomon Islands are free to determine their exchange rates for all other foreign currencies. A tax of SI$3 is levied on sales of foreign exchange exceeding SI$3,000. No. Commercial banks may enter into forward contracts with residents of the Solomon Islands in any currency. Arrangements for Payments and Receipts Contractual commitments in a foreign currency to nonresidents may be met by payments only in the currency specified in the contract. Export proceeds may be received in any foreign currency or in Solomon Islands dollars from an account of an overseas bank with a branch in the Solomon Islands. The Solomon Islands participates in the Melanesian Spearhead Group Trade Agreement, PACER, and PICTA. Exchange control is administered by the CBSI through the Foreign Exchange Control Regulations. The CBSI delegates extensive powers to commercial banks, which have been appointed ADs in foreign exchange and may approve certain transactions. Effective May 4, 2005, the limit on payment applications that may be approved by commercial banks is SI$50,000 (previously, SI$25,000) or the equivalent, with the CBSI approving all other bona fide requests for foreign exchange. On May 4, 2004, payments that commercial banks may approve were raised to SI$25,000, or its equivalent, from SI$5,000; and the remaining delays in internal payments that were introduced in June 2000 were lifted. No. No. Only Solomon Islands nationals may be granted a license to pan for alluvial gold. The CBSI is authorized to buy, sell, and hold gold but has not yet undertaken any such transactions.

However, effective February 18, 2004, nonresident wholly owned subsidiaries may borrow locally up to 300% (previously, 100%) of the total shareholders’ investment (i.e., the paid-up equity capital; preference shares; undistributed profits; shareholders’ loans from abroad; and, in certain instances, the hard core of shareholders’ trade credit). To finance a foreign direct investment into South Africa, nonresidents are allowed to borrow up to 300% of the rand value of the funds originating from abroad and invested locally. This does not apply to emigrants or to the acquisition of residential properties by nonresidents or affected persons, or any other financial transactions, such as portfolio investments by nonresidents, securities lending, hedging, or repurchase agreements. The ability to borrow locally, which is generally granted, increases with the size of local participation by a set formula. Prior approval, which is generally granted, is required to ensure that the repayment and servicing of loans do not disrupt the balance of payments and that the level of interest rates paid is reasonable in terms of prevailing international rates. Effective October 26, 2004, firms may borrow abroad to finance approved offshore investments using their South African balance sheets as collateral. Guarantees or sureties for financial loans require approval but not those for trade transactions. Performance bonds may be issued.

Consideration was also given to requests from domestic corporations to utilize their local cash holdings to finance up to 20% of the excess costs of the new investment when the overall cost of the investment exceeds the respective limits. The remainder was financed through foreign borrowing, the terms of which must be disclosed to the SARB. The SARB reserves the right to intervene in capital outflows for very large foreign investments in order to manage any potential impact on the foreign exchange market. With regard to foreign investments authorized before October 26, 2004, corporations may utilize their domestic resources to repay offshore loans raised after February 18, 2004, to finance or partly finance new approved investments. Such transfers are, however, limited to the greater of R 1 billion (or R 2 billion in the case of investments outside Africa) or 20% of the total outstanding loan capital per investment in any given year, provided that, during the first two years of the loan’s term, total funds transferred from South Africa do not exceed R 2 billion for each new investment, or R 1 billion for investments outside Africa. Individuals over 18 years of age may invest up to R 750,000 overseas or in a foreign currency account in South Africa, provided they obtain a tax clearance certificate from the South African Revenue Service.

Prior approval, which is generally granted, is required to ensure that the repayment and servicing of the loan do not disrupt the balance of payments and that the level of interest paid is reasonable in terms of prevailing international rates. ADs may allow the transfer of monetary gifts, including loans referred to above, within a limit of R 30,000 an applicant during a calendar year. Cash bequests and the cash proceeds of legacies and distributions from estates may be remitted abroad. ADs may provide immigrants with foreign exchange to repay loans received in their previous country of domicile for the specific purpose of financing their relocation to South Africa, provided documentary evidence of the debt is available and the immigrant is not in possession of foreign currency to repay the debt. Emigrants may transfer up to R 1.5 million a family unit or R 750,000 an individual, inclusive of any assets previously transferred abroad. Emigrants are also allowed to transfer abroad funds in excess of the aforementioned limits, subject to a transfer tax of 10% of the amount in excess of the limit. All other assets remain blocked in South Africa. The emigrant may subsequently repatriate the annual income from those blocked assets, but is prohibited from disposing of the assets, either by sale to South African residents or by asset swaps with either a foreign or a South African counterpart.

Previously, the currency was the Suriname guilder. The conversion between the two currencies is effected at a rate of SRD 1 per Sf 1,000. Sixteen gold coins are legal tender. In addition to the official exchange rate, there is a commercial bank/cambio rate at which most private sector transactions take place. Special exchange rates of SRD 1.4 per US$1 apply to imports of infant formula and SRD 2.0 per US$1 to imports of milk powder. The official exchange rate has remained constant at SRD 2.75 per US$1 since January 2004. Effective June 1, 2004, the Central Bank of Suriname (CBS) abolished the ceiling and floor of the market-determined exchange rate that is used for most private transactions. (Previously, the market-determined exchange rate, set by commercial banks and cambios, was subject to a ceiling of SRD 2.8 and a floor of SRD 2.6 per US$1.) Since then, the market exchange rate has moved very closely around the official rate.

Currency Exchange rate structure Multiple Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Syrian Arab Republic is the Syrian pound. The exchange rate system consists of several rates: First, the legally designated official rate of LS 11.20/11.25 per $1 applies to the repayment of loans and interest arising from bilateral payments agreements. Second, effective January 1, 2005, the exchange rate for the state and public sector was devalued to LS 50 per $1. Previously, from January 3, 2004, this exchange rate was LS 48.50/48.65 per $1. This rate unified (1) the budget accounting rate that applied to public sector exports of petroleum, all government imports (including essential subsidized products and invisibles), and repayment of loans and interest payments not related to bilateral payments agreements; and (2) the “rate in neighboring countries” (the commercial rate) that applied mainly to public commercial transactions, including (a) remittances abroad and payments by the public sector that are approved by the Committee for Foreign Exchange; and (b) all public sector enterprise foreign exchange transactions. Third, the “free exchange rate for private sector transactions” is an official exchange rate that is set to reflect developments in the free market exchange rates in Beirut, Lebanon, and Amman, Jordan. This rate is used for foreign exchange sales by the Commercial Bank of Syria (ComBS) and, effective January 7, 2004, by all authorized banks, for limited noncommercial transactions (e.g., medical, student, religious, and travel expenses); the extension of credit to importers of raw materials needed for exports; salaries of staff of UN and diplomatic missions in the Syrian Arab Republic; and domestic expenses of foreign oil companies. All noncommercial transactions may be effected at this rate. Fourth, the unofficial rate is the “free market rate,” which is the rate in certain cities in the region (mainly Amman and Beirut) and in Syria that applies to (1) private sector import payments; (2) private sector remittances and services receipts and payments; and (3) private capital flows. The free market rate is determined by private supply and demand, with market participants matching their needs through brokers or dealers in the offshore market.

Imports and Import Payments Foreign exchange budget The foreign exchange requirements of the state trading agencies are met from the annual foreign exchange budget; these agencies automatically receive import licenses upon submission of documentation of their import requirements. Financing requirements for imports When foreign exchange is not made available, private imports must be financed with the importers’ own resources through external credit arrangements, foreign currency deposits maintained in the Syrian Arab Republic by nonresidents, or foreign exchange purchased from other private or mixed enterprises through the intermediation of the ComBS at the free market rate. Imports of many goods are restricted to specific methods of financing. A non–interest bearing advance deposit is required for public sector imports in an amount equal to 100% of the value of the imports. Private sector imports are not subject to this requirement if they are financed from abroad. If authorized banks require an LC, an import deposit is required in the amount of 100% (10% in the case of manufacturers importing raw materials) of the value of the import plus a 3% fee.

All imports valued at more than the equivalent of LS 2,000 (LS 1,000 for imports from Lebanon) require licenses, which are provided on proof of foreign exchange availability. A fee ranging from LS 104 to LS 454 is charged on issuance of an import license. Imports are regulated through three lists: (1) the “restricted list” for products whose imports are a monopoly of the public sector; (2) the “negative list,” comprising imports that are prohibited for security, health, or religious reasons or prohibited for the protection of domestic industries; and (3) the “permitted list,” with goods whose import by the private sector is permitted, subject to the restrictions on their financing. Imports must come directly from the country of origin, but the MOET has the authority to permit certain goods to be imported from countries other than the country of origin. There is a general list of goods that may not be imported from non-Arab countries. A separate list of prohibited imports from member countries of the Arab Free Trade Area includes only goods prohibited for health, safety, religious, or environmental reasons. Imports from the Syrian free zones are allowed for certain industrial goods and for goods imported directly from the country of origin. Imports of commodities originating in Israel are prohibited. An import surcharge of 2% is applied to all imports; government imports and imports of certain essential items are exempted. Effective January 1, 2005, imports for customs duty purposes are valued at LS 50 per $1 (LS 48.65 per $1 in 2004). Import tariffs range up to 200%. All previous special levies on imports have been replaced by a unified import surcharge scheme with rates ranging from 6% to 35%. Effective September 9, 2004, Syrian nationals working abroad were no longer allowed import duty exemptions on luxury items valued between the equivalent of $500 and $7,000.

Currency Exchange rate structure Classification Exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender Exchange tax Exchange subsidy Forward exchange market Exchange Arrangement The currency of Togo is the CFA franc. Unitary. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at the rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1, which is the official buying and selling rate. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris foreign exchange market and the fixed rate between the euro and the CFA franc. There is a bank commission of 0.25% on transfers to all countries outside the WAEMU, which must be surrendered to the treasury. No. Residents are authorized to contract forward exchange cover to settle payments related to imports and exports of goods and services. Forward exchange cover is required to be in the currency of payment stipulated in the contract. The maturity is required to be no later than the import or export payment due date stipulated in the contract. Prescription of currency requirements Use of foreign exchange among residents Payments arrangements Regional arrangements Clearing agreements Administration of control International security restrictions In accordance with UN sanctions Arrangements for Payments and Receipts Togo is linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account; therefore, settlements with France, Monaco, and other Operations Account countries (WAEMU and CAEMC members and the Comoros) are made mainly in euros, but may also be made in other foreign currencies. Settlements outside the Operations Account area may be conducted freely. Foreign exchange held in a WAEMU member state is required to be transferred or deposited with an authorized intermediary or, where appropriate, with the BCEAO, whether the assets belong to a resident or a nonresident. An Operations Account is maintained with the French Treasury that links Operations Account countries. Most purchases or sales of foreign currencies or euros against CFA francs are ultimately settled through a debit or credit to the Operations Account. A multilateral clearing agreement exists between the WAEMU members and Cape Verde, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. Exchange control is administered jointly by the MOF and the BCEAO. Regulations governing the external financial relations of WAEMU member states delegate the approval process for most foreign exchange transactions to authorized banks, which must report on operations conducted under their authority. The only transactions that remain subject to the prior authorization of the MOF and the BCEAO relate to outward direct investment, domestic foreign exchange accounts, and accounts of residents abroad. Within the framework of the regional financial market, the issue, soliciting, and sale of foreign or domestic securities in Togo is subject to the prior approval of the RCPSFM. In accordance with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, the WAEMU adopted measures to freeze funds and financial assets of individuals and entities associated with terrorism. 956 ©International Monetary Fund.

The export of CFA franc banknotes by travelers is allowed. However, repurchase of exported banknotes by the BCEAO remains suspended. Furthermore, the shipment of BCEAO banknotes between authorized intermediaries and their correspondents located outside the WAEMU is strictly prohibited. The reexportation of foreign banknotes by nonresident travelers is allowed up to the equivalent of CFAF 500,000; the reexportation of foreign banknotes above these ceilings requires documentation demonstrating either the importation of the foreign banknotes or their purchase against other means of payment registered in the name of the traveler or through the use of nonresident deposits in local banks. Residents traveling to non-WAEMU countries are allowed to take out foreign currency up to the equivalent of CFAF 2 million a person. Larger amounts may be exported in the form of traveler’s checks, bank drafts, or other means of payment. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of foreign banknotes and coins (except gold coins) of countries outside the Operations Account area. Nonresidents bringing in foreign banknotes and foreign currency traveler’s checks exceeding the equivalent of CFAF 1 million must declare them to customs when entering Togo.

Currency Exchange rate structure Classification Managed floating with no pre- determined path for the exchange rate Exchange tax Exchange subsidy Forward exchange market Official cover of forward operations Exchange Arrangement The currency of Tunisia is the Tunisian dinar. Unitary. The exchange rate of the Tunisian dinar is determined in the interbank market in which commercial banks, including offshore banks acting on behalf of their resident customers, conduct transactions at freely negotiated rates. There is no limit on the spread between the buying and selling rates. The Central Bank of Tunisia (CBT) intervenes in the market and publishes an indicative interbank exchange rate for foreign currencies and banknotes by the following day. The CBT pursues a real effective exchange rate rule. Resident banks trade freely in foreign currencies in the spot market among themselves, with their foreign correspondents, and with nonresident banks in Tunisia. No. No. Importers and exporters are authorized to obtain forward exchange cover on the interbank market as of the date the contract is signed or the date on which the foreign commercial paper is domiciled, depending on the arrangements for the product concerned. Forward rates are freely negotiated by the authorized counterpart bank. Forward cover may be established for up to 12 months for imports and up to 9 months for exports. Persons who provide services are eligible for exchange cover for up to 12 months, to be provided within 30 days of the date on which the claim originated. Resident enterprises may purchase, in the forward market, futures maturing in up to 12 months to hedge against exchange risks related to the repayment of their foreign currency loans. They may also sell, for terms of up to 12 months, the foreign currency from drawings on external loans or from foreign currency investments. Nonresidents may enter into contracts with resident authorized intermediaries for forward purchases of convertible dinars, maturing in up to 12 months. Resident authorized intermediaries may engage in, among themselves or with resident enterprises, foreign currency/convertible dinar swaps, maturing in up to 12 months. They may also engage in foreign currency/convertible dinar swaps with nonresident banks operating in Tunisia, their foreign correspondent banks, and nonresident enterprises operating in Tunisia, to make spot purchases and forward sales of convertible dinars. For the purposes of hedging against foreign currency interest rate risks, forward rate agreements may be signed for terms of 12 months by resident banks with foreign correspondent banks and by resident enterprises with resident banks and nonresident banks operating in Tunisia. Residents contracting such foreign currency loans may also purchase 3-, 6-, and 12-month foreign currency options in dollars or euros. Call options in other currencies may be listed on request. Authorized intermediaries may set the forward exchange rates for foreign currencies against dinars applied to customers’ forward transactions in accordance with the procedures followed in international markets. The national reinsurance company manages this exchange cover mechanism for banks and financial institutions with respect to their borrowing abroad.

The daily ratio may exceed the maximum level by 2% at most, provided that the weekly net foreign exchange position is ±20%. If the ratio exceeds this limit, the BRSA will require the bank to comply with a ±20% level within six months. This limit is the same as that stipulated by the previous regulation, except that the net foreign exchange position is now compared to own funds instead of the capital base. The definition of own funds is provided in the Regulation on Establishment and Operations of Banks, and covers the sum core capital and supplementary capital from which some items are deducted. The same definition is used in the capital adequacy ratio. The provisions of these regulations are also applied to special financial institutions.

Private pension funds, as well as insurance companies, are regulated separately. Although private pension funds must hold a minimum percentage of 30% in the form of government securities, transitional time deposits with the CBU are permitted without limitations. In the public sector, the type of transaction authorized depends on the type of institution. Public institutions are bound by their own regulations, and the central and sub-departmental governments use their own more restrictive procedures.

The mandatory reserve requirements on foreign currency interest-bearing deposits are 25% for maturities of less than 180 days and 19% for longer maturities. In addition, a mandatory minimum interest–bearing reserve requirement of 15% is applied to total deposits in foreign currency. Certain banks are subject to higher reserve requirements. Until January 1, 2004, banks were required to partially satisfy this requirement by holding ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution URUGUAY 1029 dollar-denominated certificates of deposit issued by the CBU in an amount equal to at least 6% of total deposits. The remaining reserve requirement is met with deposits in the CBU. Reserves are computed on the basis of daily deposits, including weekends. For foreign currency deposits, at least 90% of the required reserves need to be complied with on a daily basis. For peso deposits, reserve balances are allowed to be less than the required level for up to four days a month without incurring a fine. Foreign currency deposits of nonresidents are exempt from the foreign currency reserve requirement. At least 30% of nonresident deposits are required to be held in a high-quality asset portfolio with a minimum of 15% in liquid assets. A ceiling is placed on foreign or local currency asset positions of 150% of the book value equity less administrative fixed assets (i.e., nonperforming loans that are two years or more overdue, fixed assets, investments, and deferred charges). The ceiling on the long or short asset-liability positions in foreign currency–denominated “operations to be settled” (i.e., future contracts and sales of securities subject to repurchase agreements) is 150% of the book value equity less administrative fixed assets. In addition, a ceiling applies on the foreign currency position (after deduction of the operations to be settled position) of 170% of the book value equity less administrative fixed assets. For foreign currency, the same day buy/sell ceiling for pension funds is 0.4% of assets or the equivalent of $2 million. However, if 0.4% of assets is less than $1 million, it may trade up to that absolute amount daily. Further, there is a limit on trading the same instrument on the same day of up to 1.5% of the pension fund assets for the previous day. Insurance companies may invest abroad a maximum of 30% of total assets used for covering technical provisions and required capital. Private pension funds must hold a minimum of 30% and a maximum of 60% of total assets in the government securities. In the public sector, the type of operation permitted depends on the type of institution. Public institutions are bound by their own by-laws, and the central government and sub-governments use their own procedures, which are more restrictive. Effective August 24, 2004, pension funds are required to hold 40% (previously, 30%) of their assets in peso-denominated instruments. With respect to this limit, private issue securities and personal loans to affiliates and social security beneficiaries are calculated at 1.8% of their value.

Currency Exchange rate structure Classification Managed floating with no pre- determined path for the exchange rate Exchange tax Exchange subsidy Forward exchange market Exchange Arrangement The currency of Zambia is the Zambian kwacha. Unitary. The official foreign exchange rate is determined in the interbank market. The market relies on primary dealers as market makers to provide two-way bid/offer prices during business hours with the spread based on market fundamentals and with trades quoted in lots of $50,000. All foreign currency trades are required to pass through the interbank market. The Bank of Zambia (BOZ) intervenes in the market primarily through transactions with the primary dealers but may also transact with market makers (i.e., other banks). The interbank rates provide the basis for determining the BOZ exchange rates: the BOZ’s buying rate is the simple average of the primary dealers’ low bid rates while the BOZ’s selling rate is the simple average of the primary dealers’ high offer rates.

Status Under IMF Articles of Agreement Currency Exchange rate structure Multiple Classification Managed floating with no pre- determined path for the exchange rate Exchange Arrangement The currency of Zimbabwe is the Zimbabwe dollar. Yes. On January 12, 2004, the rate of Z$55 per US$1 was eliminated; foreign exchange transactions of the government and NOCZIM—the national oil company—previously conducted at that rate are effected at the Z$824 per US$1 rate. Previously, the exchange rate of the Zimbabwe dollar was pegged de facto to the U.S. dollar at the rate of Z$55 per US$1 and this rate applied to official and some private transactions. Also effective January 12, 2004, all other transactions are effected through a tender system, which operates three times a week. Transactions under these two rates are effected through a carrot and stick retention based export incentive scheme (Exchange Control Directive RE 511, December 24, 2003) operated by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ). Under the tender system, ADs submit detailed bids on behalf of their customers. An RBZ committee then examines the bids and eliminates those that are for nonpriority purposes. Successful bidders are allocated foreign exchange on the basis of their bids and pay the amount bid. The tender rate is calculated as the weighted average of the prices offered to the successful bidders. As a result of these developments, the exchange arrangement of Zimbabwe was reclassified, effective January 31, 2004, to the category managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate from the category conventional pegged arrangement. Effective November 1, 2004, an enhanced carrot-and-stick framework for horticulture was introduced since this sector has a shorter export marketing cycle compared to other goods. Only banks are licensed to deal in foreign exchange with the public. Effective July 21, 2005, a floor exchange rate of Z$17,500 per US$1 is applied for inward remittances. Previously, this rate was set at Z$6,200 per US$1 on November 1, 2004 and Z$9,000 per US$1 on May 19, 2005. Effective July 21, 2005, the exchange rate of Z$17,500 per US$1 is applied at the tobacco auction floor. Previously, on January 17, 2004, the RBZ purchased 75% of foreign exchange receipts from the tobacco auction at the tender rate at Z$824 per US$1. Effective February 1, 2005, tobacco producers are treated as direct exporters for purposes of exchange rate administration and access to foreign exchange. No. The following export subsidies apply: (1) Z$5,000 a kilogram of cotton and (2) Z$5,000 a gram of gold. The government does not purchase foreign exchange at the rate of Z$824 per US$1. No. Arrangements for Payments and Receipts All payments by nonresidents to residents must be effected in any of the 17 currencies freely convertible through ADs, with the exception of payments otherwise specified or effected through nonresident accounts. 1059 Exchange tax Exchange subsidy Forward exchange market Prescription of currency requirements Controls on the use of domestic currency ©International Monetary Fund.

No person, either as principal or agent, may deal in or possess gold unless that person is (1) the holder of a license or permit; (2) the holder or distributor of a registered mining location from which gold is being produced; or (3) the employee or agent of any of the persons mentioned in (1) and (2) above and authorized by an employer or principal to deal in or possess gold that is already in the lawful possession of the employer or principal. A mining commissioner may issue to any person a permit authorizing the acquisition, possession, or disposal of any gold, provided the quantity does not exceed one troy ounce. In all other cases, permission may be issued by the Secretary for Mines only. Under the terms of the Gold Trade Act, three types of licenses may be issued: a gold dealing license, a gold recovery works license, and a gold assaying license. All gold obtained from a registered mining location must be lodged with the holder of its gold dealing license no later than the tenth day of every month unless specific permission has been granted by the mining commissioner or the appropriate minister. Any person intending to smelt gold or any article containing gold must first obtain a license issued by a district commissioner under the terms of the Secondhand Goods Act, which authorizes the possession of smelting equipment. The exportation of gold in unmanufactured form is controlled and licensed by the Ministry of Mines; these controls do not apply to the RBZ. No export licenses for gold are issued. The importation of gold is controlled by the Gold Trade Act, which requires those intending to import gold into Zimbabwe to meet certain requirements.

Gold producers and tobacco farmers may maintain FCAs, which are credited with, effective December 31, 2004, 40% (previously, 20%) of their export receipts in foreign currencies and which they may use to purchase imports. Gold producers sell 60% of their output at a fixed support price—effective July 21, 2005, Z$230,000 a gram—and sell the remaining 40% on the international market. The proceeds from the latter are deposited in the producers’ FCAs, which are subject to the same retention periods as such accounts of other exporters.

Previously, the RBZ bought the foreign exchange from exporters and sold the proceeds to ADs to finance market requirements. Sixty percent of export receipts for gold are paid by the RBZ to gold producers in convertible currency, which they may place in FCAs. Effective July 21, 2005, the price of gold was raised to Z$230,000 a gram. A waiver of the surrender requirement is granted to exporters and is applicable to the incremental portion of their export, calculated on a quarterly basis.
