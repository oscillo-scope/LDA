PREFACE
　　　　The Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions has been published by the IMF since 1950. It draws on information available to the IMF from a number of sources, including that provided in the course of official staff visits to member countries, and has been prepared in close consultation with national authorities. The information is presented in a tabular format.
　　　　This project was coordinated in the Monetary and Capital Markets Department by a staff team directed by Karl F. Habermeier and comprising Judit Vadasz, Annamaria Kokeny, Jahanara Zaman, and Maria Zenaida M. de Mesa. It draws on the specialized contribution of that department (for specific countries), with assistance from staff members of the IMF’s five area departments, together with staff of other departments. The report was edited by Linda Griffin Kean of the External Relations Department and produced by Mrs. de Mesa and the IMF Multimedia Services Division.

INTRODUCTION
　　This volume (the fifty-eighth edition) of the Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER) provides a description of the foreign exchange arrangements, exchange and trade restrictions, and relevant prudential measures of individual IMF member countries.1 Publication of the AREAER is based on Article XIV, Section 3, of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, which mandates annual reports on the restrictions in force, as well as on the Review of the 1977 Surveillance Decision that requires IMF staff to review “(a) the introduction, substantial intensification, or prolonged maintenance, for balance of payments purposes, of restrictions on, or incentives for, current transactions or payments, or (b) the introduction or substantial modification for balance of payments purposes of restrictions on, or incentives for, the inflow or outflow of capital.”
　　The 2007 edition attempts to provide a full and complete description of exchange and trade systems, going beyond exchange restrictions or exchange controls. To this end, a few changes have been made to the structure and content of the report in order to provide a more accurate and up-to-date description of the regulatory framework for current and capital account transactions.2 In general, the descriptions relate to exchange and trade systems as of end-2006, but in some cases reference is made to significant developments that occurred through mid-July 2007. As in the 2006 AREAER, this year’s report provides information related to restrictions on current international payments and transfers and multiple currency practices (MCPs), other than those imposed solely for international security considerations.3 This information consists of verbatim quotes from the latest IMF staff reports issued as of December 31, 2006, and represents the views of IMF staff, which may not necessarily have been endorsed by the IMF Executive Board.4
　　The report also includes a De Facto Classification of Exchange Rate Regimes and Monetary Policy Framework (Table 5). The classification is based on the information available on members’ de facto arrangements, as analyzed by IMF staff, which may differ from countries’ officially announced arrangements. The table on Summary Features of Exchange Arrangements and Regulatory Frameworks for Current and Capital Transactions in Member Countries (which appears at the end of this Introduction) provides an overview of the characteristics of the exchange and trade systems of IMF member countries. The Country Table Matrix (which comprises the Appendix) provides a complete listing of the categories used in the database, and the Compilation Guide (which follows this Introduction) includes definitions and explanations for the consistent application and interpretation of the categories.
I. OVERALL DEVELOPMENTS
　　This report documents a continuing trend toward liberalization of controls on current and capital account transactions during 2006 and until mid-July 2007 and toward a strengthening of prudential rules. In general, few countries introduced new controls or limitations on foreign exchange transactions during this period. The major trends and significant overall developments highlighted in this report are the following:
● One country became an IMF member and notified the IMF of its acceptance of the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, bringing the number of IMF member countries to 185 and the number of countries covered by this report accepting these obligations to 166.
● Following the trend observed in previous years, exchange rate arrangements continued to become less flexible, with an increase in arrangements such as conventional pegs or crawling pegs. A number of countries used interventions to control appreciation pressures on exchange rates stemming primarily from foreign exchange inflows.5 As a result, excluding changes in methodology, the number of independent and managed floats declined by end-April 2007 compared with end-April 2006, respectively, by four and eight countries. The change in the approach to monetary unions, as explained below, resulted in a structural break in the data. A backward revision of the database using the new definition is being implemented.
● Other changes in exchange arrangements not related to exchange rate regimes (such as rules for the operation of markets or taxes levied on exchange transactions) moved generally in the direction of liberalization, by simplifying the exchange rate structure and developing forward exchange markets.

● The number of exchange restrictions, other than those imposed solely for security reasons, continued to decline, with an increase in the number of countries that do not maintain any exchange restrictions or MCPs to 148 from 143 at end-2005. Only 34 countries reported exchange restrictions and/or MCPs at end-2006.
● Among controls on the current account, both trade-related measures and controls on invisible transactions were liberalized to a significant extent.
● In the area of capital account transactions, changes reported by countries until mid-July 2007 show a general trend toward easing of controls. However, a few countries introduced market-based capital controls mainly to stem capital inflows (the topic of the
Introduction).
● A significant portion of the measures introduced in the financial sector were of a prudential nature,6 while some affected capital controls. Whereas the majority of the changes in this category affecting capital account transactions aimed at relaxing rules and controls, the prudential measures for banks and other credit institutions were primarily geared toward tightening them.
The sections below highlight developments in the major areas covered in this edition. Details of the exchange arrangements and
A. Developments in Exchange Arrangements
　　The exchange arrangements maintained by members are classified into eight categories.7 These categories are based on the flexibility of the arrangement and how it operates in practice—i.e., the de facto regime is described instead of following the de jure or official description of the arrangement. The individual categories are defined in detail in the Compilation Guide.
● In 2006, there was a continuing shift to tighter control of nominal exchange rates in several member countries. Table 1 shows the change in exchange rate arrangements of IMF members since 2006, and Table 5 provides the current classification of countries and their monetary policy framework. There was an increase in less flexible exchange rate arrangements, such as conventional pegs, while the number of independent and managed floaters decreased. The list of countries and the changes observed in 2006
monetary unions discussed below) encompassed the increase in the number of conventional pegs to 56 countries, mainly reflecting tighter control over the exchange rates of countries previously classified as managed floating (e.g., Argentina), and the decrease in the rate of crawl of some crawling pegs (e.g., Bolivia and the Islamic Republic of Iran). In most of these cases, the authorities have not made official commitments to maintaining the exchange rate level, and the de facto peg arose because the authorities resisted appreciation pressures while managing their currency with reference to the U.S. dollar.
● The 2007 report implements a new treatment of monetary unions. They are now classified based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. As a result, members of the European Union became independent floaters (13 countries), members of the CAEMC (6 countries) and members of the WAEMU (8 countries) became conventional fixed pegs, and members of the ECCU became currency boards (6 countries). For the latter three monetary unions, the reclassification emphasized the external anchors and the specificities of the monetary regime (the currency board).
● The dollar remained the most common reference currency for pegs. The SDR is now rarely used. The role of the euro remains limited to countries with historical (CFA franc zone) or geographic links with the EMU. Some members began to rely more heavily on the euro in their foreign exchange reserves management and their exchange rate policy (Kuwait, Russia, and Tunisia). This has not yet amounted to an observable classification trend, but the reason some members aim to shift to such an arrangement anchor.
● The number of crawling pegs increased with the addition of countries that decided to let their exchange rate appreciate but, at the same time, wanted to closely control the pace of the appreciation and limit volatility (Azerbaijan, China). Appreciation pressures can be explained for the most part by large external inflows. These inflows, in conjunction with relatively thin foreign exchange markets, can lead to disruptive fluctuations of the exchange rate.
● Against the backdrop of strong external pressures (most often for appreciation), several independent floaters, such as Armenia, Tanzania, and Uganda, used intervention policies that go beyond limiting very short-run volatility in the exchange rate.
Accordingly, their exchange rate arrangements have been reclassified from independent to managed float.
　　Other exchange rate arrangements did not change much during the period April 2006–April 2007. On balance, the changes tended to ease controls (Table 2).
● On January 1, 2007, Slovenia adopted the euro as its sole legal tender.
● The most noticeable change in exchange rate structure is the increase in the number of countries maintaining dual or multiple exchange rates. Four countries were reclassified to having dual or multiple exchange rate structures because they introduced exchange measures that may lead to spreads exceeding 2% between exchange rates applied for different transactions. Conversely, the Syrian Arab Republic reduced the number of its exchange rates, and hence the exchange rate structure has been reclassified to dual from multiple. In addition, the exchange rate structure in some countries was reclassified as of January 1, 2006. The new classification reflects only a technical correction and does not imply that there has been a significant change in the exchange rate regime of these countries affecting the exchange rate structure.8
● Finally, Brazil, China, India, Malaysia, and Vietnam changed their regulations to facilitate the development of their forward exchange markets.

ChangesType of ChangeArgentinaThe exchange rate structure became dual in 2006 as a result of an exchange measure that applied different exchange rates for the surrender of certain foreign exchange proceeds. The measure was meanwhile eliminated.Tightening of controlsAzerbaijanThe old banknotes are out of circulation from the beginning of 2007.Neutral/institutional changeThe BahamasCommercial banks’ open spot or forward positions may not exceed 10% of the respective bank’s capital base instead of the previous limit of B$500,000.Neutral/institutional changeBrazilBanks are permitted to trade on a forward basis. Such transactions must be settled within 750 days instead of 360 days as it was previously.Neutral/institutional changeBurundiEffective July 5, 2006, the exchange rate structure was reclassified to multiple, because the exchange rates at the auction, the official exchange rate, and the market exchange rate may differ by more than 2%.

II. ACCEPTANCE OF ARTICLE VIII OBLIGATIONS AND EXCHANGE MEASURES
　　This section provides a brief overview of the status in accepting Article VIII obligations and describes the recent developments in exchange measures, including exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices (MCPs) subject to the provisions of Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. In addition, this section also covers the restrictions that countries impose to protect national and international security.
A. Article VIII Obligations
　　Accepting the obligations of the IMF’s Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, members commit to refrain from imposing restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions and from engaging in discriminatory currency arrangements or MCPs, except with IMF approval. The continued trend toward acceptance of Article VIII obligations observed until December 2005 came to a halt in 2006. In early 2007, the Republic of Montenegro became an IMF member9 and accepted the obligations of Article VIII. As a result, since 2005 the number of IMF member countries increased to 185, and the number of countries in Article VIII status increased by one to 166 (out of the 188 in this report). The number of countries that have not yet accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and continue to avail themselves of the transitional arrangements of Article XIV remained unchanged at 19.
B. Exchange Measures
Restrictions and/or Multiple Currency Practices
Major findings on the existence of exchange restrictions during 2006 are the following:
● The number of countries that do not maintain any restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions or do not engage in discriminatory currency arrangements or MCPs increased to 148 (79%) from 143 (76%) in 2005.10
● Out of the 34 countries that maintain some type of exchange restrictions,11 the majority have already accepted the obligations of Article VIII, while a few of the countries are under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV.
● Among countries maintaining exchange restrictions, the most widely used restrictions are different types of controls on the making of payments and transfers for current invisible transactions (Tables 3 and 7). In general, most countries that maintain restrictions apply quantitative limits (for example, Mozambique and Myanmar) and documentary requirements on foreign exchange allowance for certain current international transactions, including payments for travel and profit remittances (for example, Ethiopia and Lao P.D.R. require tax certification for these transactions). In total, 16 countries (including Botswana, Burundi, Colombia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and São Tomé and Príncipe) also maintained MCPs in 2006. In addition, a few countries maintained restrictions in the form of frozen foreign currency deposits (for example, Bosnia and Herzegovina and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia), margin deposit requirements for certain imports (for example, Sri Lanka), or as evidenced by the accumulation of private external payment arrears (for example, Malawi).

　　Countries continued to eliminate exchange restrictions in 2006 in order to gain the benefits of liberalization.12 For example, Burundi eliminated an exchange restriction on May 30, 2006. Mauritania removed an exchange restriction under Article VIII arising from foreign exchange rationing and thus maintains an exchange system free of restrictions.
● The number of countries (such as Iraq and Nigeria) for which sufficient information was not available in 2006 to assess the existence of exchange restrictions has been reduced to six from nine in 2005.13 For three countries in this category (including Egypt), staff review of the foreign exchange system concluded that the relevant exchange system was free of exchange restrictions and MCPs as of December 31, 2006.
● Only two countries introduced new exchange restrictions or MCPs during the reporting period.
International Security Restrictions
　　The trend toward more regularly notifying the IMF of restrictions introduced for national and international security reasons continued in 2006. Exchange restrictions have to be reported to the IMF, irrespective of their purpose.14 In 2006 and early 2007, 16 country authorities fulfilled this obligation and notified the IMF of security-related restrictions. All these countries (consisting mostly of developed industrial countries) reported that they imposed financial sanctions and restrictions to fight against financial terrorism, in accordance with relevant UN Security Council resolutions and EU regulations.
III. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS
　　This section documents the major developments and changes in a large number of categories, including arrangements for payments and receipts, trade-related (export/import) measures, payments for invisible transactions and current transfers, regulations on resident and nonreside
A. Trade Measures
　　The category of trade-related measures covers exchange and trade restrictions on exports and imports. Overall, there was an easing of trade-related measures during 2006 and until mid-July 2007. Out of the 140 measures reported by 52 countries in the category of imports and import payments, the majority aimed at liberalization of controls, by lifting import bans on certain goods, reducing tariff rates, and eliminating documentation requirements for certain imports. Tightening of measures on imports and import payments mostly took the form of import prohibitions and increases in import duty rates on certain goods. A similar easing of controls was observed in the category of exports and export proceeds. Most changes in this category in 2006 were in repatriation and surrender requirements of export proceeds. Out of 30 countries reporting changes in this category, 12 countries relaxed the repatriation and surrender requirements and only 3 countries introduced or increased controls on these transactions.
B. Regulations Related to Current Invisible Transactions
　　In general, the extent of exchange controls on current invisible transactions declined during 2006 and until mid-July 2007. Out of 50 countries that liberalized controls on payments and transfers for current account transactions, the majority either abolished or raised the quantitative limits on the availability of foreign exchange for making payments for these transactions. A number of countries in this category also relaxed the documentation and/or approval requirements for current invisible transactions. With respect to regulations related to resident and nonresident accounts, countries most often moved to ease controls, allowing residents and nonresidents more access to foreign currency accounts to facilitate their current international transactions.
C. Capital Controls
　　As in 2005 and as in other categories, during 2006 and until mid-July 2007 the general trend toward easing of controls was also seen in controls on capital transactions. Sixty-five countries informed the IMF of about 200 changes in different categories of capital controls, including controls on capital and money market instruments, credit operations, foreign direct investment (FDI), real estate, and personal capital transactions. Of these changes, only 38 entailed the introduction of limitations on some capital transactions. A few countries introduced market-based capital controls mainly to stem capital inflows. For example, Colombia introduced a 40% unremunerated reserve requirement (URR) on portfolio inflows. Similarly, effective December 19, 2006, Thailand imposed a 30% URR on certain types of capital inflows.15 Among the measures intended to liberalize capital controls, the majority eased controls on capital and money market and derivatives instruments. The controls on FDI were also liberalized in several members. For example, India allowed FDI inflows up to 100% in certain sectors, while Korea raised the limit on outward FDI to US$10 million from US$3 million. In addition, several members eased controls on real estate transactions, allowing residents (nonresidents) to acquire real estate abroad (locally). In contrast, as part of
IV. PROVISIONS FOR COMMERCIAL BANKS AND INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS
　　This section reviews the major developments related to provisions specific to commercial banks and institutional investors. with a focus on some prudential measures which are in the nature of capital controls.16 The category "Provisions specific to the financial sector" describe monetary, prudential, and foreign exchange controls.17 For example, some of these items (among others, borrowing abroad, lending to nonresidents, purchase of locally issued securities denominated in foreign exchange, and investment regulations) may be similar or identical to the entries under respective categories of controls on capital and money market instruments, credit operations, or direct investments, if the same regulations apply to commercial banks as to other residents. In such case, the entry also appears in the respective category in the Section “Capital Transactions.”
　　The main changes in the measures under this category during 2006 and until mid-July 2007 are presented in Table 4 and can be summarized as follows:
● For provisions specific to commercial banks and other credit institutions, the majority of the changes reported by 55 countries were prudential-type controls (79 of the total 106 measures in this category could be categorized as prudential controls). Although most countries moved toward liberalization of capital controls in this category, the changes in the prudential regulations were primarily geared toward tightening. The most important types of tightening include increases in reserve requirements for commercial banks and other credit institutions (for example, Botswana, India, and Georgia); limits on loans in foreign currency (for example, Lebanon), and tighter limits on foreign exchange positions (for example, Kazakhstan and the Philippines).
● As with changes in the provisions specific to commercial banks and other credit institutions, the majority of changes in the p
undertaken, only 12 were capital controls). However, the direction of changes in these measures was different from those in commercial banks, with 17 measures (6 prudential controls and 11 capital controls) moving toward easing. The most notable of these was the easing of controls on unit trust management companies and insurers, allowing them to invest abroad a larger proportion of the assets under their management. For example, Malaysia increased the investment limit for resident institutional investors in foreign currency assets. Similarly, Thailand allowed selected institutional investors to invest without limits in securities issued abroad by Thai juridical persons.
　　A number of reported changes in the provisions specific to the financial sector could not be linked directly to the easing or tightening of rules because they were made mainly to allow the creation or development of instruments and institutions of prudential oversight. These changes are recorded as neutral and institutional changes and include most of the changes to the methods of calculating net open positions of banks, setting limits on securities exposure, and establishing prescriptions for determining the technical provisions of insurance companies. Some other measures simply reflect new circumstances, most notably changes in the remuneration of reserves (except when the remuneration was eliminated, which was considered tightening).

In recent years, capital inflows in emerging market economies have once again been on the upswing, reflecting both domestic and global developments. While capital inflows are often beneficial to recipient countries and an indicator of increased integration of these economies in the g some co in short-term and more volatile flows, particularly portfolio equity investment flows, and in certain countries, banks’ foreign borrowings.
The policy response to increasing capital inflows has focused on macroeconomic measures, such as fiscal consolidation, reserve accumulation, greater exchange rate flexibility, and monetary easing. In addition, countries have adopted prudential measures to affect the magnitude and composition of flows and mitigate financial sector risks.
Capital consi information on capital controls and their use, with a special emphasis on indirect controls on inflows.
Capital Controls—An Overview
The aim

Capital controls can take two main forms: direct or administrative controls and indirect or market-based controls.17
Direct controls
Direct or administrative controls usually take the form of regulations on cross-border financial transactions. Typically, they restrict capital transactions and/or the associated payments and transfers of funds through outright prohibitions, explicit quantitative limits, or an approval p
obligations on the banking system to control transactions and often involve significant documentation requirements. Enforcement of direct controls also requires adequate administrative capacity in the foreign exchange authority (usually the central bank). The specific categories of administrative controls correspond to the balance of payments categories in the AREAER’s Country Table Matrix (Appendix) and are not repeated here.
Indirect controls

In dual (two-tier) or multiple exchange rate systems, different exchange rates apply to different types of transactions. In essence, the twotier market attempts to raise the cost of certain outward or inward investments by applying a more depreciated (appreciated) exchange rate to such t to establ
satisfied at a more favorable exchange rate. Two-tier foreign exchange markets have typically been established when the authorities have seen 
financial institutions not to lend to borrowers engaged in speculative activity, leading to the development of another market with different exchange r app

insofar as they cover transactions defined as current in the IMF’s Articles of Agreement,19 as explained in the Annex to the Introduction of the 2006 AREAER.
Explicit taxation of cross-border flows similarly aims at limiting the attractiveness of external financial transactions by reducing their rate of return or r cons

proportion of the inflows or net positions in foreign currency at zero interest.20 Because the structure of the AREAER is based on capital account transactions as they appear in the balance of payments, and URRs usually cover several transactions at the same time, they appear in more than one category of capital transactions.
URRs may function as a selective exchange tax that may be differentiated to discourage particular types of transactions. The effective rate of the 
Because the duration of the investment is inversely related to the implied tax rate, URRs represent a higher burden on short-term investments than on those with a longer term. Hence, URRs were often applied to discourage short-term capital flows, thereby tilting the composition of the flows to long-term investments, which are considered to be more stable.
Frequently, URRs are applied in conjunction with minimum holding periods, during which the capital may not be repatriated without what would often be a stiff penalty. Country practices vary on the possibility of transferring the income from the investment during the holding period. Residents or nonresidents participating in certain external financial transactions may be required to channel the transactions through dedicated accounts. The mandatory use of the accounts allows the authorities to monitor the amount and composition of capital flows and facilitates the administration of the URR.
The co exter encompassed all capital transactions, the rules might be relaxed to exempt certain favored categories of inflows (like FDI or trade credits). If thi derivatives strategies based on exempted inflows to circumvent the controls. As a result, similarly to other capital controls, URRs tend to lose their effectiveness over time and in many cases become ever more complicated.

or prudential rules. The key criterion for distinguishing them is that capital controls are applied asymmetrically to residents and nonresidents. Measures differentiating between domestic and foreign currency transactions are usually understood to be prudential or monetary in nature. Thus, if a central bank does not pay interest on the compulsory reserves of deposit-taking institutions, this does not necessarily mean that the measure is a URR, even though it might still be considered an indirect tax. However, if reserve requirements on nonresidents’ deposits are unremunerated, while those on residents’ deposits bear interest or are exempted from the reserve requirement altogether, the measure would be considered a capital control.
Other indirect regulatory controls have the characteristics of both price- and quantity-based measures and involve discrimination between different types of transactions or investors. Although they may influence the volume and nature of capital flows, such regulations may at net ex or betwe strict sense, reporting requirements for specific transactions have also been used to monitor and control capital movements (for example, derivative transactions and non-trade-related transactions with nonresidents).

Classification of Exchange Rate Arrangements and Monetary Policy Frameworks
The classification system is based on the members’ actual, de facto regimes, which may differ from their officially announced arra informal commitments to exchange rate path. It distinguishes among the more rigid forms of pegged regimes (such as currency board arrangements), other conventional fixed peg regimes against a single currency or a basket of currencies, exchange rate bands around a fix choice of exchange rate regime for the degree of independence of monetary policy. This includes a category to distinguish the exchange arrangements of those countries that have no separate legal tender. The system presents members’ exchange rate regimes against alternative monetary policy frameworks in order to present the role of the exchange rate in broad economic policy and to illustrate that different forms of exchange rate regimes could be consistent with similar monetary frameworks. The monetary policy frameworks listed are as follows:
Exchange rate anchor
The monetary authority stands ready to buy or sell foreign exchange at given quoted rates to maintain the exchange rate at its predetermined level or within a range (the exchange rate serves as the nominal anchor or intermediate target of monetary policy). These r and crawling pegs with or without bands, where the rate of crawl is set in a forward-looking manner. Monetary aggregate target

a de jure crawling peg arrangement, the rate of crawl of the exchange rate has been near zero vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar from January 2006 to January 2007 because of appreciation pressures from hydrocarbons exports. Starting January 2007, the central bank gradually appreciated the currency but at a very moderate pace until end-April 2007. As a result, the exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified, effective January 1, 2006, to the category conventional pegged arrangement from the category crawling peg.

Costa RicaOn October 17, 2006, the central bank of Costa Rica replaced the crawling peg with a crawling band. The edges of the band are periodically adjusted. On January 31, 2007, the rate of crawl of the band’s floor was reduced by C 0.06 a day to zero and that of the ceiling by C 0.03 a day to C 0.11, allowing for a faster widening of the band.

Table 7. Type of Restrictions and/or Multiple Currency Practices Maintained by Countries, December 31, 2006 (Based on information in published IMF staff reports)1
CountryRestrictions and/or Multiple Currency PracticesAlbaniaThe staff report for the 2006 Article IV consultation with Albania states that as of July 10, 2006, Albania’s exchange rate arrangement was free from exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII. However, the country still availed itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV and maintained exchange restrictions in the form of outstanding debit balances on inoperative bilateral payment agreements, which were in place before Albania became a Fund member. These relate primarily to debt in nonconvertible and formerly nonconvertible currencies, which the authorities are working to resolve by mid-2007 for official creditors, and by end-2007 for private sector creditors. (Country Report No. 06/286)ArubaThe staff report for the 2005 Article IV consultation with the Kingdom of the Netherlands-Aruba states that as of April 11, 2005, Aruba maintained a foreign exchange restriction arising from the foreign exchange tax on payments by residents to nonresidents. This tax, which amounts to 1.3% of the transaction value, was introduced when Aruba was part of the Netherlands Antilles, to generate revenue for the government. Aruba adopted it after gaining autonomy (status aparte) in 1986. Since then, it has served as a source of general tax revenue for the central government of Aruba. (Country Report No. 05/204)BangladeshThe staff report for the fifth review under the Three-Year Arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility with Bangladesh states that as of October 10, 2006, Bangladesh maintained a restriction on the convertibility and transferability of proceeds from nonresident taka accounts. (Country Report No. 06/406)Bosnia and HerzegovinaThe staff report for the 2006 Article IV consultation with Bosnia and Herzegovina states that as of September 29, 2006, Bosnia and Herzegovina maintained restrictions arising from measures taken with respect to frozen foreign currency deposits, mainly on the transferability of balances and interest accrued for nonresidents. (Country Report No. 06/371)BotswanaThe staff report for the 2006 Article IV consultation with Botswana states that as of December 4, 2006, Botswana maintained a multiple currency practice subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3, arising from the Foreign Exchange Risk-Sharing Scheme (FERSS) applicable to outstanding external loans obtained by certain public enterprises before October 1, 1990. (Country Report No. 07/227)BurundiThe staff report for the 2006 Article IV consultation with Burundi states that as of July 5, 2006, Burundi maintained two multiple currency practices inconsistent with Article VIII, Section 3, arising from or in connection with the current Dutch auction system, and one exchange restriction inconsistent with Article VIII, Section 2 (a), resulting from the authorization process that is applied to certain current international transactions. One multiple currency practice results from the fact that no mechanism limits the potential variation of winning bids from differentiating from each other by more than 2 percent. The other multiple currency practice results from the fact that the exchange rate used for government transactions takes place at a rate that may differ by more than 2 percent from market exchange rates. The exchange restriction results from the central bank having discretion to refuse to authorize the sale of foreign exchange for reasons other than in connection with verifying the bona fide nature of the transaction. An exchange restriction was eliminated on May 30, 2006. (Country Report No. 06/311)ColombiaThe staff report for the 2006 Article IV consultation with Colombia states that as of October 16, 2006, Colombia maintained the following two exchange measures subject to Fund approval under Article VIII: (a) an exchange restriction arising from a special foreign exchange regime for the hydrocarbon sector that limits the availability of foreign exchange for branches of foreign corporations that choose to participate in the regime and (b) a multiple currency practice and an exchange restriction arising from a tax on remittances abroad of nonresident income which is withheld when the foreign exchange is purchased. (Country Report No. 06/408)Congo DRThe staff report for the Staff Monitored Program states that as July 5, 2006, the Democratic Republic of the Congo maintained measures that give rise to one restriction and one multiple currency practice (MCP) subject to Fund approval under Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. The exchange restriction involves an outstanding net debit position vis-à-vis other contracting members under the inoperative regional payments agreement with the Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries (CEPGL). The multiple currency practice involves a fixed exchange rate set on a quarterly basis applying to transactions through the bilateral payments agreement (BPA) with Zimbabwe. (Country
Report No. 06/259)EcuadorThe staff report for the 2005 Article IV consultation with Ecuador states that as of January 5, 2006, Ecuador maintains an exchange restriction subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2 (a), in the form of a freeze on demand and savings deposits held in closed banks managed by the Deposit Guarantee Agency. (Country Report No. 06/98).Table 7 (Continued)
CountryRestrictions and/or Multiple Currency PracticesEthiopiaThe staff report for the 2005 Article IV consultation with the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia states that as of March 6, 2006, Ethiopia maintained exchange restrictions relating to (a) the tax certification requirement for repatriation of investment income; (b) restrictions on repayment of legally entered into external loans and supplies and foreign partner’s credits; (c) rules for issuance of import permits; and (d) the requirement to provide a clearance certificate from the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) to obtain import permits. (Country Report No. 06/159)GuineaThe staff report for the 2005 Article IV consultation with Guinea states that as of December 5, 2005, Guinea maintained a multiple currency practice arising from the potential divergence of the official reference rate and the interbank market rate of more than 2%. (Country Report No. 06/37)IndiaThe staff report for the 2006 Article IV consultation with India states that as of November 29, 2006, India maintained the following restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, which are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a): restrictions related to the non-transferability of balances under the India-Russia debt agreement; restrictions arising from unsettled balances under inoperative bilateral payments arrangements with two Eastern European countries; and a restriction on the transfer of amortization payments on loans by non-resident relatives. (Country Report No. 07/63)Iran, I. R. ofThe staff report for the 2005 Article IV consultation with the Islamic Republic of Iran states that as of March 8, 2006, the Islamic Republic of Iran maintained one exchange restriction and two multiple currency practices subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3. The exchange restriction arises from limitations set out in the bylaws adopted to implement the Foreign Investment and Promotion Act on the transferability of (periodic) rial profits from certain foreign direct investments. The multiple currency practices arise from: budget subsidies for foreign exchange purchases in connection with payments of certain letters of credit opened prior to March 21, 2002, under the previous multiple exchange rate system; and obligation of entities that had received allocation of foreign exchange for payments based on subsidized “allocated rates” under the previous multiple exchange rate system to surrender unused allocations to the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) at the allocation rate. (Country Report No. 06/154)Lao P.D.R.The staff report for the 2005 Article IV consultation with the Lao People’s Democratic Republic states that as of February 22, 2006, the Lao P.D.R. maintained a restriction subject to Fund approval under Article VIII (tax payment certificates are required for some transactions). (Country Report No. 06/399)Macedonia, FYRThe staff report for the 2006 Article IV consultation with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia states that as of July 14, 2006, FYR Macedonia maintained an exchange restriction subject to the Fund’s approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a), arising from restrictions imposed on the transferability of proceeds from current international transactions contained in the former frozen foreign currency savings deposits. (Country Report No. 06/344)MalawiThe staff report for the second review under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility and Request for Waiver of Performance Criteria with Malawi states that as of August 16, 2006, Malawi maintained an exchange restriction (as evidenced by the private external payment arrears) and a multiple currency practice under Article VIII (arising from the significant spread between the commercial bank exchange rate and the rates at foreign exchange bureaus). (Country
Report No. 06/445)MozambiqueThe staff report for the fifth review under the Three-Year Arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility with the Republic of Mozambique states that as of December 4, 2006, Mozambique maintained restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions subject to Fund approval under Article VIII as evidenced by: (i) the discretionary prior approval for remittances of family living expenses; (ii) the authorization for the purchase of foreign exchange in excess of US$5,000 for certain transactions; (iii) the prohibition for the conversion of balances of nonresidents’ domestic currency accounts into foreign currency or transfer abroad; and (iv) the need for proof of performance of a service prior to authorizing its payment. (Country Report No. 07/36)MyanmarThe staff report for the 2006 Article IV consultation with Myanmar states that as of September 20, 2006, Myanmar maintained exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval under Article VIII. These include (i) limits on the availability of foreign exchange for foreign travel by residents, (ii) limits on remittances of wage income by nonresidents, and (iii) limits on payments and transfers for certain other invisible transactions, and a multiple currency practice resulting from the divergence between the official exchange rate and the parallel marketdetermined FEC rate.PakistanThe staff report for the 2006 Article IV consultation with Pakistan states that as of November 1, 2006, Pakistan maintained an exchange restriction on payments for current international transactions subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2a, resulting from limitations on advance payments for certain imports. (Country Report No. 06/426)Table 7 (Continued)
	Country	Restrictions and/or Multiple Currency PracticesSão Tomé and	The staff report for the third review of the Three-Year Arrangement with São Tomé and Príncipe states that as of
Príncipe	December 29, 2006, São Tomé and Príncipe maintained exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval under Article VIII. The authorities intend to remove the exchange restriction on transfers abroad of dividends with the new Investment Code. The remaining exchange restriction and multiple currency practice is related to the possibility of rationing at the auctions by the central bank, and of commercial bank rates deviating, temporarily, by more than 2 percent from the Banco Central de São Tomé and Príncipe reference rate in-between auctions. In 2006, the multiple currency practice spread between the central bank buying and selling rate was eliminated and the spread was set at 2 percent. (Country Report No. 07/102)Sri Lanka	The staff report for the 2006 Article IV consultation with Sri Lanka states that as of November 2, 2006, Sri Lanka maintained an exchange restriction inconsistent with Article VIII, Section 2(a), of the Fund’s Articles by requiring importers to deposit with commercial banks margins of 50% of the total invoice value with respect to the import of certain goods (and 100% with respect to certain vehicles). In particular, these measures restrict current payments due in connection with letters of credit (which are normal short-term banking and credit facilities under Article XXX(d)). (Country Report No. 06/466)Suriname The staff report for the 2005 Article IV consultation with Suriname states that as of February 8, 2006, Suriname maintained multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval arising from (i) the absence of a mechanism to prevent a possible deviation of more than 2 percent between the official exchange rate used for government transactions and the market-determined bank/cambios rate and (ii) the preferential exchange rate for infant formula imports. (Country
Report No. 06/135)Syrian Arab The staff report for the 2006 Article IV consultation with the Syrian Arab Republic states that as of July 14, 2006, Syria Republic maintained under Article XIV restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions, including administrative allocation of foreign exchange. Syria also maintains exchange measures that are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII: (i) a prohibition against purchases by private parties of foreign exchange from the banking system for some current international transactions; (ii) a multiple currency practice resulting from divergences of more than 2% between the official exchange rate and officially recognized exchange rates; (iii) a non-interest-bearing advance import deposit requirement of 75% to 100% for public sector imports as well as private sector imports which are not financed from abroad; and (iv) an exchange restriction arising from the net debt under inoperative bilateral payments arrangements with the Islamic Republic of Iran and Sri Lanka. (Country Report No. 06/294)Tunisia	The staff report for the 2006 Article IV consultation with Tunisia states that as of May 10, 2006, Tunisia maintained a multiple currency practice resulting from honoring exchange rate guarantees extended prior to August 1988 to development banks, which will automatically expire after the existing commitments have matured. (Country Report
No. 06/207)Zimbabwe	The staff report for the 2005 Article IV consultation with Zimbabwe states that as of August 1, 2005, Zimbabwe maintained restrictions on the making of transfers and payments for current international transactions, and multiple currency practices, inconsistent, respectively, with Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3, of the Fund’s Articles of
Agreement. Zimbabwe maintains multiple currency practices (MCP) arising from the lack of a mechanism to prevent a divergence of more than 2 percent between (i) the exchange rates in the official and parallel markets, (ii) the exchange rates applicable for private sector imports and government imports, (iii) the exchange rates paid by successful bidders in the same tender, (iv) the exchange rate used for surrender of export receipts, including from international gold sales (weighted average rate from each auction) and the other rates in the exchange market, and (v) the exchange rate applicable to inward remittances of foreign exchange. Zimbabwe also maintains exchange restrictions arising from (i) limitations on the availability of foreign exchange, in the form of priority lists that limit the provision of foreign exchange for certain specified transactions which are subject to the approval of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), and (ii) the existence of private sector external payment arrears inconsistent with Article VIII, Section 2(a).

COMPILATION GUIDE
Following a standardized approach, the description of each system is broken down into similar categories, and the coverage for each country includes a final section that lists chronologically the significant changes during 2006 and, in the case of some countries, those that occurred through end-June 2007. The Compilation Guide provides the definitions and methodology used to bring together information under each heading.
The re inc database maintained by IMF staff.22 The country chapters present an abstract of the relevant information that is available to the IMF.
Status under IMF Articles of Agreement
Article VIIIThe member country has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement.Article XIVThe member country continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, Section 2.
Exchange MeasuresRestrictions and/or multiple currency practicesExchange restrictions and multiple currency practices maintained by a member country under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, or under Article XIV, Section 2, of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, as specified in the latest IMF staff reports issued as of December 31, 2006.International security restrictionsRestrictions on payments and transfers in connection with international transactions imposed by member countries for reasons of national or international security.In accordance with IMF Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51)International security restrictions on the basis of IMF Executive Board Decision No. 144(52/51), which establishes the obligation of members to notify the IMF before imposing such restrictions or, if circumstances preclude advance notification, as promptly as possible.Other security restrictionsOther restrictions imposed for security reasons (e.g., in accordance with UN or EU regulations) but not notified to the IMF under Board Decision 144-(52/51).References to legal instruments and hyperlinksSpecific references to the underlying legal materials and hyperlinks to the legal texts. The category is included at the end of each section.
Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe official legal tender of the country.Other legal tenderThe existence of another currency that is officially allowed to be used in the country.Exchange rate structureIf there is one exchange rate, the system is called unitary; if there is more than one exchange rate that may be used simultaneously for different purposes and/or by different entities, and these exchange rates give rise to multiple currency practices or differing rates for current and capital transactions, the system is called dual or multiple. Different effective exchange rates resulting from exchange taxes or subsidies, excessive exchange rate spreads between buying and selling rates, bilateral payments agreements, and broken cross rates are not included in this category.ClassificationAs the de facto methodology for classification of exchange rate regimes is based on a backward-looking approach that relies on past exchange rate movement and historical data, some countries are reclassified retroactively to a date when the behavior of the exchange rates changed and matched the criteria for reclassifications to the appropriate category. For these countries, if the retroactive date of reclassification is prior to the period covered in this report, then the effective date of change to be entered in the country chapter and the changes section is deemed to be the first day of the year in which the decision of reclassification took place.
Exchange arrangement with no separate legal tenderThe currency of another country circulates as the sole legal tender (formal dollarization). Adopting such regimes implies the complete surrender of the monetary authorities’ control over domestic monetary policy. Effective January 1, 2007, exchange arrangements of the countries that belong to a monetary or currency union in which the same legal tender is shared by the members of the union are classified under the arrangement governing the joint currency. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The classification thus reflects only a definitional change, and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members.Currency board arrangementA monetary regime based on an explicit legislative commitment to exchange domestic currency for a specified foreign currency at a fixed exchange rate, combined with restrictions on the issuing authority to ensure the fulfillment of its legal obligation. This implies that domestic currency will be issued only against foreign exchange and that it remains fully backed by foreign assets, eliminating traditional central bank functions such as monetary control and lender-of-last-resort, and leaving little scope for discretionary monetary policy. Some flexibility may still be afforded, depending on the strictness of the banking rules of the currency board arrangement.Conventional pegged arrangementThe country (formally or de facto) pegs its currency at a fixed rate to another currency or a basket of currencies, where the basket is formed from the currencies of major trading or financial partners, and weights reflect the geographic distribution of trade, services, or capital flows. The currency composites can also be standardized, as in the case of the SDR. There is no commitment to irrevocably keep the parity. The exchange rate may fluctuate within narrow margins of less than ±1% around a central rate—or the maximum and minimum value of the exchange rate may remain within a narrow margin of 2%—for at least three months. The monetary authority stands ready to maintain the fixed parity through direct intervention (i.e., via sale or purchase of foreign exchange in the market) or indirect intervention (e.g., via aggressive use of interest rate policy, imposition of foreign exchange regulations, exercise of moral suasion that constrains foreign exchange activity, or intervention by other public institutions). The flexibility of monetary policy, though limited, is greater than in the case of exchange arrangements with no separate legal tender and currency boards because traditional central banking functions are still possible, and the monetary authority can adjust the level of the exchange rate, although relatively infrequently.Pegged exchange rate within horizontal bandsThe value of the currency is maintained within certain margins of fluctuation of at least ±1% around a fixed central rate, or the margin between the maximum and minimum value of the exchange rate exceeds 2%. It also includes arrangements of countries in the ERM of the European Monetary System (EMS), which was replaced with the ERM II on January 1, 1999. There is a limited degree of monetary policy discretion, depending on the width of the band.Crawling pegThe currency is adjusted periodically in small amounts at a fixed rate or in response to changes in selective quantitative indicators, such as past inflation differentials vis-à-vis major trading partners or differentials between the inflation target and expected inflation in major trading partners. The rate of crawl can be set to generate inflation-adjusted changes in the exchange rate (backward looking) or set at a predetermined fixed rate and/or below the projected inflation differentials (forward looking). Maintaining a crawling peg imposes constraints on monetary policy in a manner similar to a fixed peg system.Crawling bandThe currency is maintained within certain fluctuation margins of at least ±1% around a central rate—or the margin between the maximum and minimum value of the exchange rate exceeds 2%—and the central rate or margin is adjusted periodically at a fixed rate or in response to changes in selective quantitative indicators. The degree of exchange rate flexibility is a function of the width of the band. Bands either are symmetric around a crawling central parity or widen gradually with an asymmetric choice of the crawl of upper and lower bands (in the latter case, there may be no predetermined central rate). The commitment to maintain the exchange rate within the band imposes constraints on monetary policy, with the degree of policy independence being a function of the width of the band.Managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rateThe monetary authority attempts to influence the exchange rate without having a specific exchange rate path or target. Indicators for managing the rate are broadly judgmental (e.g., balance of payments position, international reserves, parallel market developments), and adjustments may not be automatic. Intervention may be direct or indirect.Independently floating	The exchange rate is market determined, with any official foreign exchange market intervention aimed at moderating the rate of change and preventing undue fluctuations in the exchange rate, rather than establishing a level for it.
Exchange tax	Foreign exchange transactions are subject to a special tax. Bank commissions charged on
foreign exchange transactions are not included in this category; rather, they are listed under the exchange arrangement classification.
Exchange subsidy Foreign exchange transactions are subsidized by using separate, nonmarket exchange rates. Forward exchange market The existence of a forward exchange market.
Official cover of forward operations Official coverage of forward operations refers to the situation in which an official entity (the central bank or the government) assumes the exchange risk of certain foreign exchange transactions.
Arrangements for Payments and Receipts
Prescription of currency requirements
Payments arrangementsThe official requirements affecting the selection of currency and the method of settlement for transactions with other countries. When a country has payments agreements with other countries, the terms of these agreements often lead to a prescription of currency for specified categories of payments to, and receipts from, the countries concerned. This category includes information on the use of domestic currency in transactions between residents and nonresidents, both domestically and abroad; it also indicates any restrictions on the use of foreign currency among residents.Bilateral payments arrangementsTwo countries have an agreement to prescribe specific rules for payments to each other, including cases in which private parties are also obligated to use specific currencies. These agreements can be either operative or inoperative.Regional arrangementsMore than two parties participate in a payments agreement.Clearing agreementsThe official bodies of two or more countries agree to offset with some regularity the balances that arise from payments to each other as a result of the exchange of goods, services, or— less often—capital.Barter agreements and open accountsThe official bodies of two or more countries agree to offset exports of goods and services to one country with imports of goods and services from the same country, without payment.Administration of controlThe authorities’ division of responsibility for monitoring policy, administering exchange controls, and determining the extent of delegation of powers to outside agencies (banks are often authorized to effect foreign exchange transactions).Payments arrearsOfficial or private residents of a member country default on their payments or transfers in foreign exchange to nonresidents. This category includes only the situation in which domestic currency is available for residents to settle their debts, but they are unable to obtain foreign exchange—for example, because of the presence of an officially announced or unofficial queuing system; it does not cover nonpayment by private parties owing to bankruptcy of the party concerned.Controls on trade in gold (coins and/ or bullion)Separate rules for trading in gold domestically and with foreign countries.Controls on exports and imports of banknotesRegulations governing the physical movement of means of payment between countries.
Where information is available, the category distinguishes between separate limits for the (1) export and import of banknotes by travelers and (2) export and import of banknotes by banks and other authorized financial institutions.Resident Accounts
Indicates whether resident accounts that are maintained in the national currency or in foreign currency, locally or abroad, are allowed and describes how they are treated and the facilities and limitations attached to such accounts. When there is more than one type of resident account, the nature and operation of the various types of accounts are also described; for example, whether residents are allowed to open foreign exchange accounts with or without approval from the exchange control authority, whether these accounts may be held domestically or abroad, and whether the balances on accounts held by residents in domestic currency may be converted into foreign currency.
Nonresident Accounts
Indicates whether local nonresident accounts maintained in the national currency or in foreign currency are allowed and describes how they are treated and the facilities and limitations attached to such accounts. When there is more than one type of nonresident account, the nature and operation of the various types of accounts are also described.
Blocked accountsAccounts of nonresidents, usually in domestic currency. Regulations prohibit or limit the conversion and/or transfer of the balances of such accounts.
Imports and Import Payments
Describes the nature and extent of exchange and trade restrictions on imports.Foreign exchange budgetInformation on the existence of a foreign exchange plan, i.e., prior allocation of a certain amount of foreign exchange, usually on an annual basis, for the importation of specific types of goods and/or services; in some cases, also differentiating among individual importers.Financing requirements for imports
Documentation requirements for release of foreign exchange for importsInformation on specific import-financing regulations limiting the rights of residents to enter into private contracts in which the financing options differ from those in the official regulations.Domiciliation requirementsThe obligation to domicile the transactions with a specified (usually domestic) financial institution.Preshipment inspectionMost often a compulsory government measure aimed at establishing the veracity of the import contract in terms of volume, quality, and price.Letters of creditParties are obligated to use letters of credit (LCs) as a form of payment for their imports.Import licenses used as exchange licenses
Import licenses and other nontariff measuresImport licenses are used not for trade purposes but to restrict the availability of foreign exchange for legitimate trade.Positive listA list of goods that may be imported.Negative listA list of goods that may not be imported.Open general licensesIndicates arrangements whereby certain imports or other international transactions are exempt from the restrictive application of licensing requirements.Licenses with quotasRefers to situations in which a license for the importation of a certain good is granted, but a specific limit is imposed on the amount to be imported.Other nontariff measuresMay include prohibitions on imports of certain goods from all countries or of all goods from a certain country. Several other nontariff measures are used by countries (e.g., phytosanitary examinations, setting of standards), but these are not covered fully in the report.Import taxes and/or tariffsA brief description of the import tax and tariff system, including taxes levied on the foreign exchange made available for imports.Taxes collected through the exchange systemIndicates if any taxes apply to the exchange side of an import transaction.State import monopolyPrivate parties are not allowed to engage in the importation of certain products, or they are limited in their activity.
Exports and Export Proceeds
Describes restrictions on the use of export proceeds, as well as regulations on exports.Repatriation requirementsThe obligation of exporters to repatriate export proceeds.Surrender requirements
Surrender to the central bank
Surrender to authorized dealersRegulations requiring the recipient of repatriated export proceeds to sell, sometimes at a specified exchange rate, any foreign exchange proceeds in return for local currency to the central bank, commercial banks, foreign exchange markets, or exchange dealers authorized for this purpose.Financing requirementsInformation on specific export-financing regulations limiting the rights of residents to enter into private contracts in which the financing options differ from those in the official regulations.Documentation requirementsThe same categories as in the case of imports are used.Export licensesRestrictions on the right of residents to export goods. These restrictions may take the form of quotas (where a certain quantity of shipment abroad is allowed) or the absence of quotas (where the licenses are issued at the discretion of the foreign trade control authority).Export taxesA brief description of the export tax system, including any taxes that are levied on foreign exchange earned by exporters.Payments for Invisible Transactions and Current Transfers
Describes the procedures for effecting payments abroad in connection with current transactions in invisibles, with reference to prior approval requirements, the existence of quantitative and indicative limits, and/or bona fide tests. Detailed information on the most common categories of transactions is provided only when regulations differ for the various categories. Indicative limits establish maximum amounts up to which the purchase of foreign exchange is allowed on declaration of the nature of the transaction, mainly for statistical purposes. Amounts above those limits are granted if the bona fide nature of the transaction is established by the presentation of appropriate documentation. Bona fide tests also may be applied to transactions for which quantitative limits have not been established.
Trade-related paymentsIncludes freight and insurance (including possible regulations on non-trade- related insurance payments and transfers), unloading and storage costs, administrative expenses, commissions, and customs duties and fees.Investment-related paymentsIncludes profits and dividends, interest payments (including interest on debentures, mortgages, etc.), amortization of loans or depreciation of foreign direct investments, and payments and transfers of rent.Payments for travelIncludes international travel for business, tourism, etc.Personal paymentsIncludes medical expenditures abroad, study expenses abroad, pensions (including regulations on payments and transfers of pensions by both state and private pension providers on behalf of nonresidents, as well as the transfer of pensions due to residents living abroad), and family maintenance and alimony (including regulations on payments and transfers abroad of family maintenance and alimony by residents).Foreign workers’ wagesTransfer abroad of earnings by nonresidents working in the country.Credit card use abroadUse of credit and debit cards to pay for invisible transactions.Other payments	Includes subscription and membership fees, authors’ royalties, consulting and legal fees, etc.

Repatriation requirements
Surrender requirements
Surrender to the central bank
Surrender to authorized dealersThe definitions of repatriation and surrender requirements are similar to those applied to export proceeds.Restrictions on use of fundsRefers mainly to the limitations imposed on the use of receipts previously deposited in certain types of bank accounts.
Capital Transactions
Describes regulations influencing both inward and outward capital flows. The concept of controls on capital transactions is interpreted broadly. Thus, controls on capital transactions include prohibitions; need for prior approval, authorization, and notification; dual and multiple exchange rates; discriminatory taxes; and reserve requirements or interest penalties imposed by the authorities that regulate the conclusion or execution of transactions or transfers; or the holding of assets at home by nonresidents and abroad by residents. The coverage of the regulations applies to receipts as well as to payments and to actions initiated by nonresidents and residents. In addition, because of the close association with capital transactions, information is also provided on local financial operations conducted in foreign currency, describing specific regulations in force that limit residents’ and nonresidents’ issuing of securities denominated in foreign currency or, generally, limitations on contract agreements expressed in foreign exchange.Repatriation requirements
Surrender requirements
Surrender to the central bank
Surrender to authorized dealersThe definitions of repatriation and surrender requirements are similar to those applied to export proceeds.Controls on capital and money market instrumentsRefers to public offerings or private placements on primary markets or their listing on secondary markets.On capital market securitiesRefers to shares and other securities of a participating nature, and bonds and other securities with an original maturity of more than one year.Shares or other securities of a participating natureIncludes transactions involving shares and other securities of a participating nature if they are not effected for the purpose of acquiring a lasting economic interest in the management of the enterprise concerned. Investments for the purpose of acquiring a lasting economic interest are addressed under foreign direct investments.Bonds or other debt securitiesRefers to bonds and other securities with an original maturity of more than one year. The term “other securities” includes notes and debentures.On money market instrumentsRefers to securities with an original maturity of one year or less and includes short-term instruments, such as certificates of deposit and bills of exchange. The category also includes treasury bills and other short-term government paper, bankers’ acceptances, commercial papers, interbank deposits, and repurchase agreements.
Provisions specific to institutional investors
On collective investment securitiesIncludes share certificates and registry entries or other evidence of investor interest in an institution for collective investment, such as mutual funds, and unit and investment trusts.Controls on derivatives and other instruments
Controls on credit operationsRefers to operations in other negotiable instruments and nonsecured claims not covered under the above subsections. These may include operations in rights; warrants; financial options and futures; secondary market operations in other financial claims (including sovereign loans, mortgage loans, commercial credits, negotiable instruments originating as loans, receivables, and discounted bills of trade); forward operations (including those in foreign exchange); swaps of bonds and other debt securities; credits and loans; and other swaps (e.g., interest rate, debt/equity, equity/debt, foreign currency, as well as swaps of any of the instruments listed above). Controls on operations in foreign exchange without any other underlying transaction (spot or forward trading on the foreign exchange markets, forward cover operations, etc.) are also included.Commercial creditsCovers operations directly linked with international trade transactions or with the rendering of international services.Financial creditsIncludes credits other than commercial credits granted by all residents, including banks, to nonresidents, or vice versa.Guarantees, sureties, and financial backup facilitiesIncludes guarantees, sureties, and financial backup facilities provided by residents to nonresidents and vice versa. It also includes securities pledged for payment or performance of a contract—such as warrants, performance bonds, and standby letters of credit—and financial backup facilities that are credit facilities used as a guarantee for independent financial operations.Controls on direct investmentRefers to investments for the purpose of establishing lasting economic relations both abroad by residents and domestically by nonresidents. These investments are essentially for the purpose of producing goods and services, and, in particular, investments that allow investor participation in the management of the enterprise. The category includes the creation or extension of a wholly owned enterprise, subsidiary, or branch and the acquisition of full or partial ownership of a new or existing enterprise that results in effective influence over the operations of the enterprise.Controls on liquidation of direct investmentRefers to the transfer of principal, including the initial capital and capital gains, of a foreign direct investment as defined above.Controls on real estate transactionsRefers to the acquisition of real estate not associated with direct investment, including, for example, investments of a purely financial nature in real estate or the acquisition of real estate for personal use.Controls on personal capital transactionsCovers transfers initiated on behalf of private persons and intended to benefit other private persons. It includes transactions involving property to which the promise of a return to the owner with payments of interest is attached (e.g., loans or settlements of debt in their country of origin by immigrants), and transfers effected free of charge to the beneficiary (e.g., gifts and endowments, loans, inheritances and legacies, or emigrants’ assets).
Provisions specific to the financial sectorProvisions specific to commercial banks and other credit institutionsDescribes regulations that are specific to these institutions, such as monetary, prudential, and foreign exchange controls. Inclusion of an entry in this category does not necessarily signify that the aim of the measure is to control the flow of capital. Some of these items (e.g., borrowing abroad, lending to nonresidents, purchase of locally issued securities denominated in foreign exchange, investment regulations) may be repetitions of the entries under respective categories of controls on capital and money market instruments, on credit operations, or on direct investments, when the same regulations apply to commercial banks as well as to other residents.Open foreign exchange position limitsDescribes regulations on certain commercial bank balance sheet items (including capital)and on limits covering commercial banks’ positions in foreign currencies (including gold).
Describes controls specific to institutions, such as insurance companies, pension funds, investment firms (including brokers, dealers, or advisory firms), and other securities firms (including collective investment funds). Incorporates measures that impose limitations on

the composition of the institutional investors’ foreign or foreign currency assets (reserves, accounts) and liabilities (e.g., investments in equity capital of institutional investors or borrowing from nonresidents) and/or that differentiate between residents and nonresidents. Examples of such controls are restrictions on investments because of rules regarding the technical, mathematical, security, or mandatory reserves; solvency margins; premium reserve stocks; or guarantee funds of nonbank financial institutions. Inclusion of an entry in this category does not necessarily signify that the aim of the measure is to control the flow of capital.

Arrangements for payments and receipts
Changes during 2006
July 31.  The inoperative bilateral payments arrangement with Russia has been superseded following the Paris Club rescheduling agreement.

ALBANIA
(Position as of December 31, 2006)
Status under IMF Articles of Agreement
Article XIVYes.
Exchange MeasuresRestrictions and/or multiple currency practicesThe staff report for the 2006 Article IV consultation with Albania states that as of July 10, 2006, Albania’s exchange rate arrangement was free from exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII. However, the country still availed itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV and maintained exchange restrictions in the form of outstanding debit balances on inoperative bilateral payment agreements, which were in place before Albania became a Fund member. These relate primarily to debt in nonconvertible and formerly nonconvertible currencies, which the authorities are working to resolve by mid-2007 for official creditors, and by end-2007 for private sector creditors. (Country Report No. 06/286)International security restrictionsNo.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.
Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Albania is the Albanian lek.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Independently floatingThe exchange rate of the lek is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Bank of Albania (BOA) intervenes occasionally in the exchange market only to smooth excessive fluctuations of the exchange rate and to meet foreign currency reserve targets. The BOA may also intervene to ensure that the exchange rates reflect macroeconomic fundamentals. The BOA calculates and announces the daily average exchange rates for the dollar and 10 other major currencies and the prices of gold and silver. No margins are set between buying and selling rates for the official exchange rate, but commercial banks charge commissions ranging from 0.2% to 2%, depending on the amount, for cashing traveler’s checks. Government transactions are conducted at market rates.Exchange taxNo.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketNo.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksLaw No. 8269 of December 23, 1997, on the Bank of Albania; Regulation on the Procedure of Intervention of the Bank of Albania in the Domestic Foreign Exchange Market; www.bankofalbania.org.Arrangements for Payments and Receipts
Prescription of currency Payment for all merchandise trade is made in convertible currencies. All transactions under requirements bilateral payments agreements were suspended in 1992, and the settlement of clearing
accounts is awaiting the outcome of negotiations. All contracts denominated and payable in foreign currencies are valid.
Controls on the use of domestic	n.a. currency

Use of foreign exchange among residents
Payments arrangementsn.a.Clearing agreementsAlbania maintains outstanding balances under inoperative bilateral clearing agreements in nonconvertible currencies with Bulgaria, Cuba, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Poland, and Vietnam. Albania also maintains outstanding balances under inoperative bilateral clearing agreements in convertible currencies with Algeria, Bulgaria, Cuba, Egypt, Greece, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the Republic of Montenegro, the
Republic of Serbia, and Vietnam.Administration of control

Effective June 1, 2005, reflecting the stability of the kwanza exchange rate owing to BNA interventions, the de facto exchange rate arrangement of Angola was reclassified to a conventional pegged arrangement from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. The BNA publishes a reference rate daily, which is computed as the transaction-weighted average of the day’s rates negotiated with commercial banks. ADs (banks and exchange bureaus) are authorized to deal in foreign exchange among themselves and with their customers at freely negotiated rates.Exchange taxForeign exchange operations are subject to a stamp duty of 0.15%.

Exchange rate structureThe currency of Argentina is the Argentine peso.Dual
ClassificationAll foreign exchange transactions must take place in the free and unified foreign exchange market (MULC), according to Decree 260/2002, Communication A 3471.
Beginning July 17, 2006, the exchange rate structure became dual as a result of a measure that exporters who failed to surrender their export proceeds within the prescribed period of time surrender the proceeds to the BCRA at the reference rate on the date of surrender or the reference rate on the day the surrender should have taken place, whichever is less favorable. Effective May 17, 2007, the measure was suspended.Conventional pegged arrangementGenerally, the exchange rate of the Argentine peso is determined in the free and unified foreign exchange market (MULC) as a result of the free interplay of supply and demand. However, effective June 1, 2006, reflecting the stability of the peso exchange rate owing to the BCRA interventions, the de facto exchange rate arrangement of Argentina was reclassified as a conventional pegged arrangement from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate.Exchange taxNo.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketThere are three forward markets; transactions in these markets are settled by netting in domestic currency.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksCommunication A 3471; Decree 260/2002; www.bcra.gov.ar.Arrangements for Payments and Receipts

Borrowers should show a capacity to withstand an exchange rate depreciation in at least two scenarios; (5) debt securities or financial trust participation certificates whose underlying assets are loans made by the above-mentioned financial entities; (6) loans made from one financial entity to another; and (7) foreign currency debt securities or financial trust participation certificates, publicly listed under an authorization by the National Securities Commission, whose underlying assets are securities bought by the fiduciary and guaranteed by reciprocal guarantee companies, in order to finance export transactions.
Lending capacity surpluses (exceeding the above-mentioned designations) produce an additional cash requirement in that currency to be held in cash or as deposits with the BCRA.Purchase of locally issued securities denominated in foreign exchange
Differential treatment of deposit accounts in foreign exchangeThere are limits on the maximum amount of securities a bank may hold from a particular issuer; however, purchases of securities against delivery of assets require prior BCRA approval.Reserve requirements
Investment regulationsDemand deposits are subject to a cash requirement of 19% or 30%, depending on whether they are denominated in pesos or in foreign currency, respectively. Fixed-term deposits are subject to a differential requirement, depending on the deposit currency, that decreases according to the residual maturity.Abroad by banksTransactions are prohibited by policies on general lending.Open foreign exchange position limitsThe overall foreign exchange position of financial institutions is made up of all the institution’s liquid foreign assets; namely, gold coins and bullion, foreign currency notes, demand deposits in banks abroad, investments in foreign public securities issued by OECD member countries with a sovereign debt rating of at least AA, and banking correspondents’ debit and credit balances. Also included are agreed purchases and sales of such assets pending settlement through exchange transactions with customers at terms of no more than 48 hours.The upper limit of the overall foreign exchange position is recalculated monthly and the update takes effect on the first business day of each month. The limit on banks’ dollar exposure is 15% of a bank’s net worth (responsabilidad patrimonial computable––RPC) and the upper limit of the overall foreign exchange position is set at 15% at the end of the second to last month preceding the month of the deadline for submission of the foreign exchange to the BCRA, under the rules of the corresponding reporting regime. It is increased by 5% of the institution’s turnover of foreign exchange purchases and sales to customers in the Provisions specific to institutional investors

second to last preceding calendar month, and by 2% of total demand and term deposits established and payable domestically in foreign exchange, excluding deposits held in custody, reported by the institution at the close of the second to last preceding calendar month. If the maximum calculated is less than US$5 million, this latter amount will be considered the lower limit of the established maximum. This lower limit will be increased by US$7 million when the financial institution in question deals in foreign exchange and operates at 15 or more locations. In addition, and cumulatively, it is increased by a maximum of the equivalent of US$2 million for holdings of banknotes in foreign currencies other than the U.S. dollar and the euro; up to a maximum of US$1 million for checks drawn on foreign banks purchased from third parties and not yet credited to the correspondent accounts; and by up to a maximum of the equivalent of US$3 million for the balances of dollar or euro banknotes remitted to the U.S. Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank that are still pending deposit 72 hours after their shipment (Communications A 3645, 4347, and 4552).
The negative overall net position in foreign exchange—as a monthly average of daily balances converted to pesos at the reference exchange rate—may not exceed 30% of the net worth (RPC) of the preceding month.
Excesses are subject to a charge of up to the equivalent of twice the accrued nominal annual interest rate resulting from auctions of BCRA instruments in dollars or twice the 30-day LIBOR for operations in dollars, as reported for the last working day of the relevant month, whichever is greater. The overall net position in foreign exchange includes total assets and liabilities from financial intermediation in foreign currency and in foreign currency securities (spot and forward transactions), including derivative contracts related to these items, items recorded in the foreign exchange position, deposits in such currency in accounts held at the BCRA, as well as gold holdings and BCRA bills in dollars. Also included are forward operations entered into under master agreements within self-regulated markets in the country under the cash settlement system, without physical delivery of the underlying asset.
The position in currencies other than dollars is expressed in the relevant currency by applying the exchange rate published by the BCRA.
This list excludes assets that are deductible for purposes of determining net worth (RPC).
The regulations governing the nonfinancial private sector apply.

Insurance companies
Limits (max.) on securities issued by nonresidentsThe limit is the greater of 50% of the capital requirement or 50% of net commitments.

Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Armenia is the Armenian dram.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rateEffective January 1, 2006, the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) pursues a policy of implicit inflation targeting (IT) with the objective of moving to a full-fledged IT over the mediumterm. The refinancing interest rate is the operational target and the CBA intervenes in the foreign exchange market only for smoothing excessive exchange rate volatility. Foreign exchange transactions take place in the interbank and stock exchange markets. The CBA acts mainly in the stock exchange market. Since May 2006, the CBA increased the size and frequency of interventions in an effort to resist appreciation. As a result, the exchange arrangement has been reclassified, effective June 1, 2006, to the category managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate from the category independently floating.
Purchases and sales of foreign currency may be implemented through foreign exchange entities licensed by the CBA, including banks, foreign exchange dealers, credit institutions, and foreign exchange bureaus; or, in the case of the government, through the CBA itself, which acts as the government’s financial agent. Foreign exchange entities carry out foreign exchange transactions by setting their own buying and selling rates for major currencies against the dram without any restrictions.
The exchange rate of the dram against the U.S. dollar is determined on the basis of exchange rates prevailing in the interbank and intrabank markets and in the stock exchange on the previous day. The official exchange rate is set as the weighted average of the foreign exchange market buying and selling rates. The official exchange rate is used for accounting purposes and for those treasury operations that are connected with external debt services or create new external obligations. Foreign exchange entities use the official exchange rate of the CBA for bookkeeping and revaluation purposes.Exchange taxNo.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketResidents and nonresidents may freely negotiate forward exchange contracts for both commercial and financial transactions in all leading convertible currencies in the domestic exchange market and at major international foreign exchange markets. However, for the time being, the forward exchange market in Armenia is still undeveloped, although somebanks sign forward contracts in small amounts. The CBA conducts foreign exchange swaps as a short-term instrument.

AUSTRALIA
(Position as of December 31, 2006)
Status under IMF Articles of Agreement
Article VIIIDate of acceptance: July 1, 1965.
Exchange MeasuresRestrictions and/or multiple currency practices
International security restrictionsNo restrictions as reported in the latest staff report as of December 31, 2006.In accordance with IMF Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51)On August 25, 2006, and October 5, 2006, Australia notified the IMF that it had imposed financial restrictions against certain persons and entities associated with the government of Zimbabwe, the former government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and 12 entities and one individual of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. These financial restrictions are administered by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), at the direction of the Australian government.Other security restrictionsPursuant to UN Security Council sanctions, financial restrictions are imposed on certain listed persons or entities with a connection to the following countries: the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (Al-Qaida and the Taliban), Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the former government of Iraq, Liberia, and Sudan.
Pursuant to UN Security Council terrorism-related resolutions, Australia has imposed financial restrictions to combat the financing of terrorism. It is prohibited for individuals or entities to hold, use, or deal in those assets or to make assets available to listed persons and entities. The list of entities and persons to which these measures apply is included on the consolidated list maintained by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksCharter of the United Nations Act 1945 and Associated Regulations; Iraq (Reconstruction and Repeal of Sanctions) Regulations; Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations 1959; Charter of the United Nations Act 1945 and Charter of the UN (Terrorism and Dealing with Assets) Regulations 2001; Details regarding the financial restrictions imposed by Australia on designated persons and entities are available at www.dfat.gov.au/un/unsc_sanctions/

Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Australia is the Australian dollar. It also circulates in several other countries, including Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Independently floatingThe exchange rate of the Australian dollar is market-determined. Licensed foreign exchange dealers may deal among themselves, with their customers, and with overseas counterparts at mutually negotiated rates for both spot and forward transactions in any currency with regard to trade- and nontrade-related transactions. However, the RBA retains discretionary power to intervene in the foreign exchange market. There is no official exchange rate for the Australian dollar. The RBA publishes an indicative rate of the trade-weighted index for the Australian dollar based on market observation at 9 a.m., noon, and 4 p.m. daily.Exchange taxNo.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketActive trading takes place in forward and futures contracts.References to legal instruments and Reserve Bank Act 1959: www.comlaw.gov.au/ComLaw/Legislation/ActCompilation1.nsf/ hyperlinks current/bytitle/C276D47C3215A796CA256F71004DA82A?OpenDocument.
Arrangements for Payments and Receipts
Prescription of currency requirements
Use of foreign exchange among residentsAn Australian financial services license (AFSL) is generally required for foreign exchange transactions by residents, with some exceptions. Foreign exchange contracts are specifically classified as a “financial product” under the Corporations Act 2001 (Act). Thus foreign currency transactions where currency is not immediately exchanged, in recognition of the risk associated with the settlement period, fall within the definition of financial product. Accordingly, dealing, making a market, or giving advice in relation to foreign exchange contracts is regulated by the Act, and requires an AFSL. However, a contract to exchange one currency (whether Australian or not) for another that is to be settled immediately by the physical delivery of notes and/or coins in the second currency is specifically excluded from the definition of financial product.
The Act, in conjunction with the Corporations Regulations 2001, contains further AFSL exemptions that specifically relate to foreign exchange contracts. Two relevant exemptions are (1) for certain dealings in foreign exchange contracts as principal for the purpose of managing financial risk; and (2) overseas entities providing advice on, or making a market in, foreign exchange contracts to “professional investor” clients. Spot foreign exchange contracts are excluded from the definition of derivative.Payments arrangementsNo.Administration of controlThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) is responsible for the licensing of all financial services providers, including foreign exchange dealers that deal in foreign currency contracts, by its administration of the AFSL regime.Payments arrearsNo.Controls on trade in gold (coins and/or bullion)If the value of the gold being bought or sold is greater than $A 10,000 or its equivalent, there is an obligation to report the details of the transaction to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre.Controls on exports and imports of banknotesExportation and importation of notes and coins totaling more than the equivalent of $A 10,000 in domestic or foreign currency must be reported to customs for forwarding to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre for purposes of combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.

If a nonresident is subject to bilateral sanctions by way of the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations 1959 and holds an account in Australia, RBA approval is required for any payment made to or from that account.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.
Imports and Import PaymentsForeign exchange budgetNo.Financing requirements for importsNo.Documentation requirements for release of foreign exchange for importsNo.Import licenses and other nontariff measuresThere are no import-licensing requirements or quotas on imports other than the tariff quota that applies to certain cheeses and curd.Negative listFor some products, imports are allowed only if written authorization is obtained from the relevant authorities or if certain regulations are observed. Among the goods subject to control are narcotic, psychotropic, and therapeutic substances; firearms and certain weapons; certain chemicals and primary commodities; some glazed ceramicware; rough diamonds; and various dangerous goods. These controls are maintained mainly to meet health and safety requirements; to meet certain requirements for labeling, packaging, or technical specifications; and to satisfy certain obligations arising from Australia’s membership in international commodity agreements or to meet obligations under international trade embargoes.Licenses with quotasQuantitative restrictions may be imposed on some goods to fulfill obligations under relevant international agreements. Such goods include certain industrial chemicals, some ozonedepleting substances, and hazardous waste.
To protect public health and safety and the environment, quantitative restrictions may be applied to genetically modified organisms and some therapeutic substances and goods.
The tariff quota that applies to certain cheeses and curd is administered through a licensing system.Import taxes and/or tariffsMost agricultural products enter Australia duty-free; the simple average applied tariff is 1.3% and the average limit is 5%. A general tariff of 5% applies to many manufactured goods, with the following exceptions. The tariff on passenger motor vehicles and certain automotive components is 10% and is scheduled to be reduced to 5% by 2010. Textiles, clothing, and footwear are subject to tariffs ranging from zero to 17.5%. Under the government’s post-2005 assistance arrangement for the textile, clothing, and footwear industry, tariffs on these products will be reduced to levels of 5% and 10% by January 1,
2010, and to 5% by January 1, 2015. Tariffs for a large range of goods have been abolished.Tariff concessions are available under the Tariff Concession System for most goods subject to a tariff, where it can be substantiated that there is no domestic manufacturer of substitutable goods. There are also a variety of concessions available for specific purposes, such as to accommodate split import consignments and to encourage investment in major projects.
The ANZCERTA establishes free trade in goods between Australia and New Zealand.
Australia has other free trade agreements (FTAs) with Singapore, Thailand, and the United States. Under the FTAs, goods originating in Singapore are duty-free, and tariffs on goods originating from Thailand and the United States are being phased out over 10 years commencing January 2005. The SPARTECA provides the Forum Island countries with nonreciprocal, duty-free access to most markets in Australia and New Zealand. All goods produced in the least developed countries and Timor-Leste may be imported free of duties and quotas.
State import monopolyNo.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.
Exports and Export ProceedsRepatriation requirementsNo.Financing requirementsNo.Documentation requirementsNo.Export licensesExport prohibitions and restrictions in effect are designed to ensure quality control, administer trade embargoes, and meet obligations under international arrangements. These prohibitions are also set up to restrict the exportation of certain defense materials; regulate the exportation of goods that involve high technology and have dual civilian and military applications; maintain adequate measures of control over designated cultural property, resources, flora, and fauna; secure conservation objectives; and respond to specific market distortions abroad. Remaining controls on primary products apply mainly to food and agricultural products. Rough diamonds may be exported only to countries participating in the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (an international effort to eliminate the trade in “conflict diamonds”) and each shipment must be accompanied by a certificate issued by the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources.
Export controls apply to uranium and related nuclear materials (including tantalum and mineral sands containing monazite) to ensure compliance with Australia’s nonproliferation policy obligations and safeguards regime. Restrictions also apply to certain other nuclear and related materials. Export permits for uranium and other nuclear and related materials are issued by the Department of Industry, Tourism, and Resources. Export permits are required from the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency for the export of high-activity radioactive sources. Licenses are required for exports of unprocessed wood, including wood chips. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry (DAFF) administers export control powers in relation to regulated dairy products under the provisions of the Dairy Produce Act. The DAFF also administers quotas for beef and sheep meat into the restricted U.S. and EU markets. This system allows the management of exports to some markets where quantitative restrictions apply.
Cattle, sheep or goat meat, and livestock may be exported only by persons or firms licensed by the DAFF. If other countries impose quantitative restrictions on imports of meat or livestock, the DAFF may, in conjunction with industry, introduce measures to control Australian exports to conform with those restrictions. As per Australia’s 2006 WTO-notified state trading enterprises (STEs) notification, there are four WTO-notified STEs operating in Australia that have some form of export control powers. AWB International Limited
(AWBI) is the only national body. There are three state-level entities that have export powers for selected agricultural products. Wheat marketing arrangements, including the status and powers of the AWBI, are currently under review, and there are temporary arrangements in effect for determining applications for bulk wheat exports from entities other than the AWBI. Australian government decisions arising from the review are expected to be made before June 30, 2007, when the temporary arrangements expire.With quotasAustralia has a complete ban on the export of merino ewes, their genetic material, ova, and embryos to any country other than New Zealand. However, merino breeding rams purchased at designated export auctions and semen from rams included in the National Register of Semen Export Donors (administered by the Australian Association of Stud Merino
Breeders) may be exported. Sales are subject to DAFF approval and an annual quota of 800rams a year, with a provision for up to 100 rams to be placed on a semen donor register. No ram nominated for collection of semen for export may be physically exported. The export restrictions do not apply to merino rams intended for slaughter; however, the export of these rams is subject to controls to ensure that they do not enter breeding stocks and to a legal undertaking by the exporter to ensure that these exported merino rams will be slaughtered. There is no restriction on the export of merino rams or reproductive material to New Zealand.

Provisions specific to commercial banks and other credit institutions
Investment regulationsAn AFSL issued by the ASIC is generally required to provide financial products advice, to deal in financial products (including securities, derivatives, and certain foreign exchange contracts), to create a market for a financial product, to operate a registered scheme, or to provide custodial or depository service. The license is subject to specific obligations under the Corporations Act, including the obligation to comply with conditions of the license. Certain disclosure requirements apply in relation to retail clients. Authorized deposit-taking institutions are subject to prudential requirements, e.g., liquidity management and credit concentration.In banks by nonresidents
Provisions specific to institutional investorsPrior approval from the treasurer is required for any person or group—domestic or foreign —to acquire a 15% or larger share in a financial sector company, including authorized deposit-taking institutions and any nonoperating holding company for these institutions in Australia.Insurance companiesForeign-owned life insurance companies may operate only in the form of locally incorporated subsidiaries unless prescribed by regulation to be able to operate as a branch. Under the Life Insurance Act 1995, only U.S. life insurers are allowed to operate in Australia through branches. However, branches of foreign incorporated life insurers operating prior to the introduction of the Life Insurance Act 1995 are permitted to continue to operate.Pension fundsThe Australian superannuation (pension) industry is regulated primarily under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (the SIS Act). Under the SIS Act, all trustees (excluding trustees of self-managed superannuation funds and public sector superannuation schemes) are required to obtain a license from APRA, and to register all funds under their trusteeship with APRA prior to accepting contributions.Limits (max.) on securities issued by nonresidentsn.a.Limits (max.) on investment portfolio held abroadn.a.Limits (min.) on investment portfolio held locallyn.a.Currency-matching regulations on assets/liabilities compositionn.a.Investment firms and collective investment fundsAustralian regulation of collective investment schemes does not impose investment restrictions of the type mentioned under this item.

Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the EMU countries has been reclassified to the category independently floating from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender.

ClassificationIn addition to the official exchange market, there is a market in which investment currency may be negotiated among residents through the Central Bank of The Bahamas (CBB). The use of investment currency is prescribed for the purchase of foreign currency securities from nonresidents and direct investments outside The Bahamas. The current premium bid and offer rates are 12.5% and 10%, respectively. Existing investors were permitted, until March 31, 2006, to liquidate their original capital investment through the investment currency market. Effective January 17, 2006, the authorities reduced the premium on approved purchases of securities and foreign real estate to 12.5% from 25%. In certain circumstances, the CBB may permit residents to retain and use foreign currency from other sources to make outward investments. Certain external investments (including investment in foreign stocks by company-based retirement funds) may be effected at the official exchange rate without paying the investment currency premium.Conventional pegged arrangementThe Bahamian dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at par. Buying and selling rates for the pound sterling are also officially quoted, with the buying rate based on the rate in the New York market; the selling rate is 0.5% above the buying rate. The CBB deals only with commercial banks. For transactions with the public, commercial banks are authorized to charge a commission of 0.50% buying and 0.75% selling per US$1, and 0.50% buying or selling per £1.Exchange taxA stamp tax of 1.5% is applied to all outward remittances.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketCommercial banks may provide forward cover for residents who are due to receive or must pay in foreign currency under a contractual commitment. Commercial banks may not, however, sell foreign currency spot to be held on account to cover future requirements without the CBB’s permission. ADs may deal forward in foreign currency with nonresidents without prior approval from the CBB. Commercial banks may execute forward deals among themselves at market rates, but they must ensure when carrying out all forward coverarrangements that their open spot or forward position does not exceed 10% of the respective bank’s capital base.

Surrender requirementsYes.Surrender to the central bankYes.Surrender to authorized dealersForeign exchange loans by nonresidents to residents must be converted by an AD to Bahamian dollars, unless exemption is granted by the CBB.Controls on capital and money market instrumentsAll outward capital transfers require exchange control approval, and outflows of residentowned capital are restricted. Inward transfers by nonresidents, which are encouraged, are required to be processed through the exchange control approval procedure, although the subsequent use of the funds in The Bahamas may also require authorization. Nonresidents may invest in obligations of companies listed on the BISX up to an aggregate of 10% of the respective issue or offering. They may also invest in public sector securities for which the
CBB acts as registrar, subject to an overall limit of B$100,000 a person or entity.On capital market securitiesThe Mutual Funds Act and a regulation that provides for licensing of mutual fund administrators and the registration of mutual funds are enforced. The Securities Industry Act authorizes the Securities Commission to regulate the stock exchange and stock exchange operations.Shares or other securities of a participating natureResident companies may invest in equities of BISX-listed companies, up to a limit of 10% of the issue or offering, an investing entity. They may invest in other private and public sector securities, without limit.Purchase locally by nonresidentsIn principle, inward investment by nonresidents is unrestricted. However, the consent of the CBB is required for the issue or transfer of shares in a Bahamian company to a nonresident and for the transfer of control of a Bahamian company to a nonresident. The extent of such approvals generally reflects the government’s economic and investment policy guidelines.Sale or issue locally by nonresidentsYes.Purchase abroad by residentsResidents employed by offshore and foreign-based institutions in The Bahamas may invest in employee stock option/share purchase plans through the official exchange market up to the equivalent of B$10,000 a person a year, on a noncumulative basis for contributory plans. Otherwise, residents are not permitted to purchase foreign currency securities with official exchange, export proceeds, or other current earnings; payment must be made with investment currency. All purchases, sales, and swaps of foreign currency securities by residents require permission from the CBB and are normally effected through authorized agents, who are free to act on behalf of nonresidents in relation to such transactions without any further approval from the CBB, at a 12.5% premium, effective January 17, 2006. Previously, the premium was 25%. All foreign securities purchased by residents of The Bahamas must be held by, or drawn to the order of, an AD.Sale or issue abroad by residentsSale proceeds from resident-held foreign currency securities that were registered at the CBB prior to December 31, 1972, or that were acquired through the investment currency market,are eligible for sale in the investment currency market. Unregistered securities may be offered for sale at the official rate of exchange.
Bonds or other debt securitiesPurchase locally by nonresidentsNonresident buyers of Bahamian dollar–denominated securities must fund the acquisition of such securities from foreign currency sources.

Controls on credit operations
Commercial creditsThe regulations governing shares or other securities of a participating nature apply.By residents to nonresidentsA resident company wholly owned by nonresidents is not allowed to raise fixed capital in Bahamian dollars, although approval may be granted to obtain working capital in local currency. If the company is partly owned by residents, the amount of local currency borrowing for fixed capital purposes is determined in relation to residents’ interest in the equity of the company. However, companies set up by nonresidents primarily to import and distribute products manufactured outside The Bahamas are not allowed to borrow Bahamian dollars from residents for either fixed or working capital; instead, they must provide all their financing in foreign currency. Banks and other lenders resident in The Bahamas must have permission to extend loans in domestic currency to any corporate body (other than a bank) that is resident in The Bahamas but is controlled directly or indirectly by nonresidents.
Foreign currency loans are normally permitted on application.To residents from nonresidentsResidents other than authorized banks must obtain permission to borrow foreign currency from nonresidents. Residents must also obtain permission to pay interest on, and to repay the principal of, foreign currency loans by conversion of Bahamian dollars. When permission is granted for residents to accept foreign currency loans, it is conditional on the currency being offered for sale without delay to an AD, unless the funds are required to meet specifically authorized payments to nonresidents.Financial creditsControls apply to all these transactions.Guarantees, sureties, and financial backup facilities
Controls on direct investmentControls apply to all these transactions.Outward direct investmentThe use of official exchange for direct investment abroad is limited to B$1 million a person or entity, with an overall limit of B$5 million a transaction, which may be met once every three years. This limit applies to investments from which the additional benefits that are expected to accrue to the balance of payments from export receipts, profits, or other earnings within 18 months of the investment will be at least equal to the total amount of the investment and will continue thereafter. Investments abroad that do not meet the above criteria may be financed by foreign currency borrowed on suitable terms, subject to individual approval from the CBB; by foreign currency purchased in the investment currency market; or by the retained profits of foreign subsidiary companies. Permission is not given for investments that are likely to have adverse effects on the balance of payments.Inward direct investmentCBB approval is required. Foreign investments in domestic insurance companies and pension funds are not permitted.Controls on liquidation of direct investmentIn the event of a sale or liquidation, nonresident investors are permitted to repatriate the proceeds, including any capital appreciation, through the official foreign exchange market.Controls on real estate transactions
Purchase abroad by residentsResidents require the specific approval of the CBB to buy property outside The Bahamas; such purchases, if for personal use, may be made only with investment currency, and approval is limited to one property a family. Incidental expenses connected with the purchase of property for personal use may normally be met with investment currency. Expenditures necessary for the maintenance of the property or arising directly from its ownership may, with permission, be met with foreign currency bought at the current market rate in the official foreign exchange market.Purchase locally by nonresidentsForeigners intending to purchase land for commercial purposes or property larger than five acres in size must obtain a permit from the Investments Board. If such an application is approved, payment for the purchase may be made either in Bahamian dollars from an external source or in foreign currency. Nonresidents wishing to purchase property for residential purposes may do so without prior approval but are required to obtain a certificate of registration from the Investments Board on completion of the transaction.Sale locally by nonresidents

Foreign exchange accounts permittedYes.Held domesticallyResidents returning from abroad may bring in any amount of foreign currency and may maintain a resident foreign currency deposit account (RFCD) with the foreign exchange brought in. However, proceeds of exports of goods and services from Bangladesh or commissions arising from business deals in Bangladesh may not be credited to such accounts. Balances in these accounts are freely transferable abroad and may be used for travel in the usual manner. These accounts may be opened in dollars, euros, pounds sterling, and yen. Local and joint-venture contracting firms executing projects financed by a foreign donor or international agency may open foreign currency accounts. Returning nonresident Bangladeshis who did not open or maintain a foreign currency deposit account while abroad may open an RFCD with foreign exchange brought in from abroad within six months of the date of their return to take up permanent residence in Bangladesh. Foreign currency accounts may also be opened in the names of diplomatic missions in Bangladesh, their expatriates, the UN and its agencies, and diplomatic bonded warehouses (duty-free shops). Foreign currency accounts may be opened in the name of resident Bangladesh nationals working for foreign or international organizations operating in Bangladesh if their salaries are paid in foreign currency.

These accounts may be credited with foreign currency brought in or remitted from abroad or transferred from a foreign currency account or another convertible taka account and may be debited for (1) local payments in taka, (2) remittances abroad in convertible currency, (3) transfers to foreign currency accounts or other convertible taka accounts, and (4) credits to nonconvertible taka accounts.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.
Nonresident AccountsForeign exchange accounts permittedBangladesh nationals residing abroad; foreign nationals, companies, and firms registered or incorporated abroad; banks and other financial institutions, including institutional investors; officers and staff of Bangladesh missions, government institutions, autonomous bodies, and commercial banks posted abroad or seconded to international or regional agencies may open and maintain during their assignment abroad nonresident foreign currency deposit accounts that bear interest and are denominated in dollars, euros, pounds sterling, or yen. These accounts may be credited in initial minimum amounts equivalent to $1,000 ($25,000 for foreigners) with remittances in convertible currencies and transfers from existing foreign currency deposit accounts maintained by Bangladesh nationals abroad. The accounts bear interest if their terms range from one month to one year. The balance, including interest earned, may be transferred in foreign exchange by the account holder to any country or to any foreign currency deposit account maintained by Bangladesh nationals abroad. The balances in the accounts, which are freely convertible into taka, must be reported monthly by banks to the BB. The accounts may be maintained as long as the account holders desire. Nonresident Bangladesh nationals who did not open or maintain a foreign currency deposit account while abroad may open an RFCD with foreign exchange brought in from abroad within six months of the date of their return to take up permanent residence in Bangladesh.All nonresident accounts are regarded for exchange control purposes as accounts related to the country in which the account holder is a permanent resident. (The accounts of the UN and its agencies are treated as resident accounts.)
Domestic currency accountsForeign missions and embassies and their expatriate personnel, foreign airline and shipping companies, and international nonprofit organizations in Bangladesh may open interestbearing convertible taka accounts, but the interest earned may be disbursed in local currency only. Taka accounts of individuals, firms, or companies residing outside Bangladesh are designated as nonresident accounts. For portfolio investments in Bangladesh through the stock exchange, a nonresident may open a nonresident investor’s taka account (NITA) with any AD with foreign exchange remitted from abroad through normal banking channels or through transfer of funds from a foreign currency account. The balance in the NITA may be used freely to buy Bangladesh shares and other securities. These balances are also freely transferable to foreign currency accounts opened in the names of (1) Bangladesh nationals residing abroad and Bangladesh nationals working and earning abroad, including selfemployed Bangladesh migrants residing abroad; (2) foreign nationals residing abroad or in Bangladesh; (3) foreign firms registered abroad and operating in Bangladesh or abroad; and (4) foreign missions and their expatriate employees. Balances in these accounts are remittable abroad in equivalent foreign exchange.Convertible into foreign currencyFunds from NITAs and convertible taka accounts may be converted freely.Blocked accountsAmounts in nonresident taka accounts covering unapproved payments may be blocked by the BB.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.
Imports and Import PaymentsForeign exchange budget
Financing requirements for importsNo.Advance payment requirementsAdvance payments for permissible imports of goods and services may be effected by ADs without prior BB permission against a repayment guarantee from a bank abroad. However, advance payments of up to the equivalent of $2,500 for imports of books, journals, or lifesaving medicines do not require any repayment guarantee.Documentation requirements for release of foreign exchange for importsInstructions have been issued to ADs to avoid irregularities during importation through land ports: (1) only one port of entry (land port) is to be named in the LC; (2) a copy of the LC and subsequent amendments, if any, including other relevant information, is to be sent to the land port authority; (3) specimen signatures of the officials working at the import-export desks of the ADs concerned, along with their contact phone and fax numbers, are to be supplied to all land ports of Bangladesh; (4) a list regarding entry of goods into Bangladesh, a certified invoice, and a bill of entry evidencing entry of goods into Bangladesh are to be collected directly from the concerned land ports by ADs’ agents or representatives. Effective initiative is to be taken to create and maintain a database that may be accessed by all ADs; (5) the LC should not contain any reimbursement or debit authority; rather, it should stipulate the following payment terms: “on receipt of documents complying with credit terms, we shall effect payment as per instructions of negotiating bank or collecting bank”; and (6) LCs covering value more than $5,000 or its equivalent should be sent through the Society for World-Wide Interbank Financial Telecommunications to the advising bank.Domiciliation requirementYes.Preshipment inspectionInspection is required for all imports, with a few exceptions.Letters of creditPayment against imports is generally permissible only under irrevocable LCs. However, a consignment of perishable food items not exceeding $7,500 or its equivalent in value may be imported overland without an LC; capital machinery and industrial raw materials may also be imported without LCs and without limit on value. Recognized export-oriented units operating under the bonded warehouse system may import up to four months’ requirements of their raw and packing materials by establishing import LCs without reference to any export LC. They may also effect such imports by opening back-to-back LCs (either on asight basis under the Export Development Fund, or for up to 180 days on a usance basis) against export LCs received by them. ADs may establish LCs on an f.o.b. basis without the approval of the BB, subject to certain conditions. Foreign exchange for authorized imports is provided automatically by ADs when payments are due.
Import licenses used as exchange licensesLC authorization forms are issued by ADs and do not require a separate import license.OtherADs are not permitted to open new LCs for importers who have failed to submit within the stipulated time period the bills of entry of imports or customs-certified invoices as evidence of actual importation of such goods.Import licenses and other nontariff measuresAll importers (including all government departments, with the exception of the Ministry of Defense) are required to obtain LCAFs for all imports. Under the authority of the IPO issued by the chief controller, importers are allowed to effect imports against LCAFs that are issued for imports under bilateral trade or payments agreements and for imports under tied-aid programs. LCAFs are otherwise valid worldwide, except for imports from Israel and imports transported on Israeli flag vessels, which are prohibited. Goods must be shipped within 18 months of the date of issuance of LCAFs in the case of machinery and spare parts, and 12 months in the case of all other items.Positive listItems not specified in the control list of the IPO may be imported freely, provided the importer has a valid import registration certificate.Negative listThe control list contains 24 items in about 357 categories at the four-digit level of the harmonized system codes. The importation of these items is restricted or prohibited for public safety, religious, environmental, or social reasons, or if similar items are produced locally.Open general licensesAll items not on the control list may be imported freely by registered importers.Licenses with quotasUnless otherwise specified in the IPO, industrial units approved on a regular basis are allowed to import up to 300% of their regular import entitlement of items whose import is banned for commercial purpose and that are importable by industrial consumers only. Industrial units approved on an ad hoc basis are allowed to import up to the maximum value, not exceeding 100% of their half-yearly import entitlement.Import taxes and/or tariffsEffective July 1, 2006, there are four tariff bands: zero, 5%, 12%, and 25% (previously, zero, 6%, 13%, and 25%). A number of goods are subject to regulatory duties, import license fees, and infrastructure development charges.State import monopolyNo.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.
Exports and Export ProceedsRepatriation requirements

Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Benin is the CFA franc.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Conventional pegged arrangementBenin participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rates for the currency concerned in the Paris foreign exchange market vis-à-vis the euro. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the WAEMU countries has been reclassified to the category conventional pegged arrangement from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change, and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members.Exchange taxA symmetrical bank commission of 0.3% applies to transfers to all countries outside the WAEMU. The proceeds of this commission must be surrendered in their entirety to the treasury. In addition, banks are allowed to charge an exchange commission of up to 2% on over-the-counter exchange for euros.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketResidents are authorized to contract forward exchange cover for payments related to imports and exports of goods and services. Forward cover may be contracted only in the currency of settlement stipulated in the commercial contract. Maturities must correspond to the due date of the import or export payment stipulated in the commercial contract.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.Arrangements for Payments and Receipts
Prescription of currency	Benin is linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account, through which requirements	settlements with France, Monaco, and other Operations Account countries (WAEMU and CAEMC member countries and the Comoros) are made in euros or in the currency of any other Operations Account country. Settlements outside the Operations Account may be conducted freely in CFA francs.

All purchases or sales of foreign currencies or euros against CFA francs are ultimately settled through a debit or credit to the Operations Account.Clearing agreementsA multilateral clearing agreement exists in the context of the WAMA among the countries of the WAEMU, Cape Verde, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. All payments related to current transactions between the member bank countries may be effected under the clearing arrangements. However, this excludes transactions specified by the committee of governors of the CBs of ECOWAS member countries and payments related to the exportation from the country of a member bank to the country of another member bank of finished products originating in countries whose CB or monetary authority is not a member of the WAMA.Administration of controlExchange control is administered jointly by the MOF and the BCEAO. Most of the authority to supervise foreign exchange transactions is delegated to authorized banks, which are required to report these operations to the MOF. The BCEAO is also authorized to collect— either directly or through banks, financial institutions, the postal administration, or judicial agents—any information necessary to compile balance of payments statistics. Customs officers monitor outflows of foreign exchange and confirm import and export of goods. All residents of WAEMU countries are treated as residents of Benin for the purposes of financial transactions. All foreign exchange operations with foreign countries must be effected through authorized intermediary banks, the postal administration, or the BCEAO. No supporting documents are required for transfers of up to the equivalent of CFAF 300,000. Within the framework of the regional financial market, the placement and soliciting of foreign and domestic securities in Benin require prior authorization by the RCPSFM.Payments arrears

Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Exports of gold have been liberalized.Domestic currencyCFA franc banknotes may be exported freely by travelers. However, the suspension of
BCEAO repurchases of exported banknotes continues. In addition, the exchange of BCEAO banknotes between authorized intermediaries and their correspondents outside the WAEMU is prohibited.
Foreign currency
On importsThe reexportation of foreign banknotes by nonresident travelers is allowed up to the equivalent of CFAF 500,000; the reexportation of foreign banknotes above this ceiling requires documentation demonstrating either the importation of the foreign banknotes or their purchase against other means of payment registered in the name of the traveler or through the use of nonresident deposits in local banks.Foreign currencyResidents and nonresidents may bring in any amount of foreign banknotes and coins (except gold coins) of countries outside the Operations Account area. Residents bringing in foreign banknotes and foreign currency traveler’s checks exceeding the equivalent of CFAF 300,000 must declare them to customs on entry and sell them to an authorized intermediary bank within eight days.

BOLIVIA
(Position as of July 31, 2007)
Status under IMF Articles of Agreement
Article VIIIDate of acceptance: June 5, 1967.

Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Bolivia is the boliviano.Other legal tenderThe dollar is also legal tender.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Conventional pegged arrangementAlthough Bolivia continues to maintain a de jure crawling peg arrangement, the rate of crawl of the exchange rate was near zero vis-à-vis the dollar from January 2006 to January 2007 because of appreciation pressures from hydrocarbons exports. Starting January 2007, the Central Bank of Bolivia (CBB) gradually appreciated the currency but at a very moderate pace until end-April 2007. As a result, the exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified effective January 1, 2006, to the category conventional pegged arrangement from the category crawling peg. The official selling rate is determined daily by the CBB at a daily competitive auction (“bolsín”). The Committee for Exchange and Monetary Policy (CEMP) sets the amount of foreign exchange to be auctioned and a price below which the CBB will not accept any bids. This floor price, which is expressed in dollars, is the official exchange rate. The CBB board determines the difference between the selling rate and a buying rate, which is currently Bs 0.10 (as of December 31, 2006), based on the CEMP recommendations. Effective March 9, 2006, the buy and sell spread on the boliviano against the dollar has been increased to Bs 0.10 from Bs 0.08. The private sector may participate in the auctions (with a minimum bid of $100,000 or its equivalent) through financial institutions that have accounts with the CBB. The opening up of the CBB exchange rate spread has resulted in the development of a private foreign exchange market, and foreign exchange sales through the bolsín have become scarce. In the present environment of a current account surplus, it is more common for the CBB to acquire foreign exchange from the financial system at the buying rate for the day, without any restriction as to the amount.Exchange taxNo.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketNo.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksBoard Resolution 144/2002 (Approving Exchange Regulations); Board Resolution 092/2005 (Amending Exchange Regulations); www.bcb.gov.bo.Arrangements for Payments and Receipts

Controls on these transfersSince July 1, 2004, a temporary tax on financial transactions (ITF) has been applied on inward transfers or shipments of money made through authorized financial institutions without using current or savings accounts and/or through institutions that provide funds transfer services that are legally established in Bolivia. Law No. 3446 of July 21, 2006, and Supreme Decree No. 28815 of July 26, 2006, extended the ITF until mid-2009 in order to maintain this tax on transactions between financial institutions. In contrast to the provisions in the previous regulation, the new law provides for taxation of all foreign currency deposits, both principal and interest, as well as shares in investment funds, including redemptions of shares and earnings. Also, the previous rate of 2.5% on $1 million was reduced to 1.5% on $1 million and is not subject to a gradual reduction as previously provided for in the April 2004 regulation. The most important exemptions from this tax are (1) savings accounts of individuals, up to $2,000 (with deposits and withdrawals being considered taxable events); this extends the $1,000 limit set in the original regulation; (2) credits and debits to accounts held by entities governed by the Securities Market Law with financial institutions or with the CBB; and (3) redemptions and earnings of shares in investment funds with balances (in local or foreign currency) less than or equal to $2,000.Investment-related paymentsThere are no restrictions on capital inflows and outflows, nor on outward remittances of dividends, interest, and royalties with respect to technology transfers or under other business categories. All remittances or transfers are subject to payment of the taxes prescribed by law. When income of Bolivian origin is paid to beneficiaries abroad, the taxed net profit must be equivalent to 50% of the total amount paid or remitted. Those who pay or remit such items to beneficiaries abroad must apply a single and final withholding at the rate of 25% of the presumed taxed net profit.Indicative limits/bona fide testYes.References to legal instruments and Law No. 2646 and other related provisions; Investment Law No. 1182, dated September 17, hyperlinks 1990; Law No. 1606 Amending Law No. 843, dated December 22, 1994; Law 3446 of July

Status under IMF Articles of Agreement
Article VIIIDate of acceptance: November 17, 1995.
Exchange MeasuresRestrictions and/or multiple currency practicesThe staff report for the 2006 Article IV consultation with Botswana states that as of December 4, 2006, Botswana maintained a multiple currency practice subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3, arising from the Foreign Exchange RiskSharing Scheme (FERSS) applicable to outstanding external loans obtained by certain public enterprises before October 1, 1990.

Exchange ArrangementCurrency
Exchange rate structureThe currency of Botswana is the Botswana pula.Unitary
ClassificationSome external loans undertaken by parastatals before October 1, 1990, are protected from exchange rate movements under a Foreign Exchange Risk-Sharing Scheme (FERSS). Under the scheme, risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations up to 4% are borne fully by the borrower; the next 6% and the following 5% of fluctuations are shared between the borrower and the government in ratios of 50:50 and 25:75, respectively. Risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations in excess of 15% are borne fully by the government. The scheme is symmetrical in that the borrower and the government share any gains from an appreciation in the external value of the pula on the same basis. Currently only one loan obtained by a public enterprise is still outstanding under the old FERSS, and it matures in 2016. The scheme was terminated in 1990. Effective January 1, 2006, the exchange rate structure was reclassified to unitary from dual due to technical correction in the classification.Crawling pegThe exchange rate of the pula is determined with reference to a weighted basket of currencies. The pula is adjusted continuously against the basket according to factors that include the difference between expected inflation in Botswana and in major trading partner countries. The spread between the buying and selling rates of the pula is 0.5%.Exchange taxNo.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketForward exchange cover is offered by the commercial banks, and the maturity dates of forward exchange contracts and transactions are not restricted.Official cover of forward operationsYes.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.Arrangements for Payments and Receipts

Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Brazil is the Brazilian real.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Independently floatingThe exchange rate of the real is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. Transactions in the exchange markets are carried out by banks, brokers, tourist agencies, and providers of tourist accommodation that are authorized to deal in foreign exchange.
Brokers may conduct: (1) transactions in banknotes, bank drafts, or traveler’s checks; (2) foreign exchange transactions related to exports and imports up to US$20,000; and (3) foreign exchange transactions up to US$10,000 related to financial operations. Tourist agencies deal only in banknotes, bank drafts, and traveler’s checks. Providers of tourist accommodation may buy only banknotes, bank drafts, and traveler’s checks.Exchange taxA 5% tax is applied to inflows related to external loans with a minimum maturity of up to
90 days. A 2% tax is applied to remittances related to obligations of credit card administration companies to pay for purchases by their clients. The tax is zero for other foreign exchange transactions.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketBanks are permitted to trade foreign exchange on a forward basis within statutory limits (bought and sold) of the exchange position; such transactions must be settled within 750 days.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksLaw 9,069 (1995); Decree 4,494 (2002); Resolution NMC 3,265 (2005); Communiqué CBB 6,565 (1999).Arrangements for Payments and Receipts
Prescription of currency requirementsPrescription of currency is required only in foreign exchange transactions related to the LAIA covenant. These transactions must be made in dollars.Use of foreign exchange among residentsThe use of foreign exchange for pricing or settlement of transactions among residents is prohibited.Payments arrangementsAll interbank transactions and clearinghouse operations must be effected through the Central Bank of Brazil’s (CBB) real-time gross settlement payments system.Regional arrangementsBrazil is a member of the LAIA.Clearing agreementsPayments between Brazil and Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican
Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay, and República Bolivariana de Venezuela may be made through special central bank accounts within the framework of the multilateral clearing system of the LAIA.Administration of controlThe National Monetary Council (NMC) is responsible for formulating the overall foreign exchange policy. Foreign trade policy is formulated by the Chamber of Foreign Trade, which consists of the minister of development, industry, and foreign trade (head); the minister of the civil house; the minister of finance; the minister of planning, budget, and administration; the minister of foreign affairs; and the minister of agriculture and supply. The Ministry of Development, Industry, and Foreign Trade is in charge of implementing trade policy, through the Secretariat of Foreign Trade (SECEX).Payments arrearsNo.Controls on trade in gold (coins and/or bullion)There are three separate markets for gold transactions: the financial, exchange, and commercial markets. Transactions that occur in the financial market and foreign exchange market are regulated by the NMC. The first domestic transaction of newly mined gold on this market is subject to a financial transactions tax of at least 1%. Rules regarding gold transactions for industrial purposes are defined separately by the federal states, which also establish different rates for the commercial tax levied thereon.On external tradeThe CBB and authorized institutions may buy and sell gold for monetary use on the international market. Imports and exports of gold for nonmonetary use are subject to the same procedures as those that are applied through the SECEX with respect to other products.Controls on exports and imports of banknotesTravelers may take out or bring in domestic or foreign banknotes, checks, or traveler’s checks without restriction but must declare to customs any amount over R$10,000 or its equivalent.
Companies that transport cash and valuables must declare to Brazilian customs the amount being transported. The recipient of the valuables, in the case of a transfer to the country, or the sender of the valuables, in the case of a transfer from another country, should be a bank authorized to operate in the foreign exchange market in Brazil.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksLaws 4,595 (1964), 9,069 (1995), and 10,192 (2001); Resolutions NMC 2,524 (1998) and 2,882 (2001).
Resident AccountsForeign exchange accounts permittedYes.Held domesticallyThese accounts may be held by authorized foreign exchange dealers, tourist agencies not authorized to deal in foreign exchange, the Brazilian Post Office Administration, credit card administration companies, companies responsible for the development and execution of projects in the energy sector, and insurance and reinsurance companies and reinsurance brokers.Held abroadn.r.Approval requiredn.r.

Use of these accounts to conduct international transfers in Brazilian reais on behalf of third parties is prohibited.Blocked accountsNo.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksDecree 42,820 (1957); Resolution NMC 3,265 (2005).
Imports and Import PaymentsForeign exchange budgetNo.Financing requirements for importsExternal financing of imports for periods in excess of 360 days must be registered in the CBB’s Financial Operations Registry, an electronic system. The CBB must be informed about prepayments of import financing at least 30 days in advance.Advance payment requirementsYes.Documentation requirements for release of foreign exchange for importsAll importers must be included in the SECEX Importer and Exporter Register; registration automatically occurs with the first transaction. Imports must be registered in the import subsystem of the Integrated Foreign Trade System (SISCOMEX/IMPORT), which allows importers, carriers, banks, and brokers to register the various stages of an import process directly through the interlinked computers of the SECEX, customs, and the CBB. Imports are grouped into the following three categories: (1) imports that do not require automatic licenses (which are the general rule), (2) imports that are subject to automatic import licenses, and (3) imports that are subject to nonautomatic import licenses.Import licenses and other nontariff measuresIn general, imports are exempt from prior approval requirements. However, some imports require prior approval (i.e., an import license) from the SECEX or another government agency. This approval is promptly given to importers whenever the licensing requirements are fulfilled. As a rule, licenses are valid for 60 days, except for imports of custom-made capital goods. The Secretariat of Federal Revenue issues clearance certificates for certain groups of commodities to special bonded warehouse importers. Import licenses for a number of specified imports may be obtained after the commodities have been landed and customs clearance obtained. The importation of certain products requires approval of the Ministry of Science and Technology. For some products, eligibility for exemption from import duties may be precluded by the existence of a satisfactory domestic equivalent.Negative listImports are prohibited of agrochemical products not authorized under Brazilian regulations; weapons; and certain drugs that are not licensed, for reasons of security, health, or morals.Licenses with quotasIn addition to imports under Brazilian concessions covered by the LAIA agreement, goods imported through the Manaus and Tabatinga free zones are subject to an annual quota. Foreign goods up to the equivalent of US$2,000 imported into the Manaus free trade zone may be transferred to other parts of Brazil (as a passenger’s baggage) free of import taxes. The tariff rate on imports of toys is 20%.
Other nontariff measuresSanitation and measurement requirements must be observed.Import taxes and/or tariffsThe MERCOSUR Customs Union agreement stipulates a CET ranging from zero to 20%, though higher rates may be applied in particular cases, such as 53 products pertaining to the automotive sector, to which a rate of 35% applies. In addition, the MERCOSUR countries have approved the use of temporary national tariff exceptions, according to which Brazil exempts from the CET 100 tariff lines until January 31, 2008. Exemptions for 77 tariff lines pertaining to telecommunications expired June 30, 2007. The Common Regime for Capital Goods that are not made in MERCOSUR countries will be effective January 1, 2009. For this reason the reduction in the import taxes for capital goods and integrated systems (extarifarios), totaling 2,480 tariff lines, will remain effective according to the term fixed by the Camex Resolution, which established them. The government established two taxes of 1.65% and 7.65%. Some exceptions to these taxes are mentioned in Law 10,865 (2004) and in Law 10,925 (2004).Taxes collected through the exchange systemForeign exchange transactions related to imports of goods are exempt from the tax on financial operations, and foreign exchange transactions related to imports of services have a tariff of zero.State import monopolyImports of petroleum and its derivatives are subject to prior disclosure from the National Petroleum Agency.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksLaw 11,371 (2006).
Exports and Export ProceedsRepatriation requirements
Surrender requirementsYes.Surrender to authorized dealersEffective August 4, 2006, 30% of the proceeds from exports are exempt from surrender requirements. Effective October 27, 2006, the deadline for surrender of export proceeds was extended to the last business day of the twelfth month following the shipment of merchandise or rendering of services. Previously, proceeds were required to be surrendered before 210 days from the shipment date for operations not subject to the Credit Register date for financed operations.Financing requirements
Documentation requirementsNo.Preshipment inspectionInspection is required for commodities subject to standardization.OtherDocumentation includes invoices, international shipment notification, and export registration. There is a simplified arrangement for foreign exchange transactions related to exports up to the equivalent of US$20,000.Export licensesExports are prohibited of wild animals and their hides, hair, feathers, or eggs in any form; jacaranda-da-Bahia wood; ipecacuanha plants; amber and white varieties of honey; and antiques more than 100 years old. Exports of certain goods require prior approval of the SECEX, including those effected through bilateral accounts, exports without exchange cover, exports on consignment, reexports, and exports requiring prior authorization from government agencies. The SISCOMEX integrates activities related to the registration, monitoring, and control of foreign trade operations into a single computerized flow of information. The SISCOMEX comprises two subsystems (exports and imports). The exports subsystem allows exporters, carriers, banks, and brokers to register the various stages of an export process directly through the interlinked computers of the SECEX, customs, and the
CBB.With quotasExports of sawed or cut pine wood, mahogany, Brazilian walnut, and virola are subject to quotas.Export taxesIn general, exports are exempt from export taxes or are subject to a tax of zero. However, export duties apply to the following: (1) fume products exported to Paraguay and Uruguay, 105%; (2) cigarettes to Central America, the Caribbean, and South America, 150%; (3)tanned leather and skins, 7% as of January 1, 2006, and 9% as of January 1, 2007; and (4) weapons and ammunition to Central America, the Caribbean, and South America (except Argentina, Chile, and Ecuador), 150%.

(Position as of December 31, 2006)

Exchange MeasuresRestrictions and/or multiple currency practicesNo restrictions as reported in the latest staff report as of December 31, 2006.International security restrictionsNo.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.
Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Brunei Darussalam is the Brunei dollar.Other legal tenderThe Singapore dollar also circulates as customary tender.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Currency board arrangementThe Brunei dollar is issued by the Brunei Currency and Monetary Board (BCMB). Under the terms of the Currency Interchangeability Agreement (CIA), signed in 1967, which remains in effect between the BCMB and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the monetary authorities agreed to the mutual exchange of each other’s currency, at par without charge, into notes and coins issued by them. Both the authorities and banks in Brunei Darussalam and Singapore are obliged to accept each other’s currency at par, and the currencies are customary tender in the territory of the other country. Excess Brunei or Singapore currency is repatriated regularly, and the cost of repatriation is borne by the currency issuing authority. The BCMB deals only in Singapore dollars and does not quote rates for other currencies. Banks, however, are free to deal in all currencies, with no restriction on amount, maturity, or type of transaction.
The Brunei Association of Banks fixes daily buying and selling rates for electronic transfers and sight drafts in 17 other currencies on the basis of the interbank quotations for these currencies in relation to the Singapore dollar. Banks in Brunei Darussalam must apply these rates for transactions with the general public for amounts up to B$100,000. Exchange rates for amounts exceeding B$100,000 are set competitively by each bank on the basis of the current interbank quotations for the Singapore dollar on the Singapore market.Exchange taxNo.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketThere is no forward market for foreign exchange in Brunei Darussalam. However, as a result of the CIA, foreign exchange risk may be hedged in terms of Singapore dollars by resorting to facilities available in that country, including foreign currency futures and options traded on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange, over-the-counter forward transactions arranged by banks in Singapore, and the short-term foreign exchange swap market operated among the banks in the Singapore money market.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.Arrangements for Payments and Receipts

Open foreign exchange position limits
Provisions specific to institutional investorsEach bank must maintain daily (1) a maximum ratio of up to 15% between its open position in any particular currency and the amount of its own funds, excluding the euro; and (2) a maximum ratio of up to 30% between its net open foreign currency position and the amount of its own funds, excluding the euro.Insurance companiesGenerally, controls specific to insurance companies, restrictions on investments because of rules on the technical or mathematical reserves, solvency margins, premium reserve stocks or guarantee funds, etc., are defined under chapter six of the Insurance Code, where (1) Section I contains the solvency requirements for an insurer and a reinsurer; (2) Section III defines the types of assets eligible to cover technical reserves, the general rules for diversification, the currency conformity rules and special rules for the cover of reserves for the investment fund related to life insurance; (3) Section IV defines own funds, solvency margin, and guarantee capital; and (4) Section V provides additional solvency requirements for insurers belonging to an insurance group.
Different types of assets are eligible to cover technical reserves of the insurance companies (Article 73 of the Insurance Code).
There are no restrictions on investing technical reserves in financial instruments issued by nonresidents. The only difference for investments in a third state is the requirement that shares, bonds (to be qualified), and other debt securities (to be qualified) have to be listed on internationally recognized and liquid regulated securities markets.
All assets must be valued in compliance with the prudence concept, taking into account liquidity risk . Insurers must invest the gross amount of technical reserves set up in assets under Article 73 of the Insurance Code in compliance with general rules for diversification (Article 74 of the Insurance Code).Currency-matching regulations on assets/liabilities compositionThe assets covering the technical reserves must be in the same currency as the liabilities ensuing from contracts under which technical reserves have been set up. Currency matchingis required when the assets in a certain currency exceed 7% of the assets in the other currencies.
Up to 20% of the total amount of technical reserves may be covered by assets in a currency other than the one in which they have been set up, provided the total amount of assets for cover of technical reserves in all currencies is at least equal to the total amount of liabilities in all currencies.
If the technical reserves have been set up in Bulgarian leva, euros, or another currency of a member state, the assets for their cover may be in euros (Article 78 of the Insurance Code).
Pension fundsControls specific to pension funds in Bulgaria are arranged in the Social Insurance Code. Chapter 14 on Assets and Investments and Chapter 16 on Investments are connected to the requirements for the investments of compulsory and voluntary pension funds, respectively. The mandatory reserves requirements are settled under Chapter 25 on Pension Reserves and Investments.
Effective July 12, 2006, some changes were introduced under Bulgarian legislation by amendments to the Social Insurance Code, and on January 1, 2007, the restrictions on investing the assets of a supplementary pension fund in foreign securities were eliminated.
However, some limits remained concerning the diversification of supplementary pension funds’ investment portfolios (Articles 178 and 251 of the Social Insurance Code). These restrictions are the same for investments in local and in foreign securities.Limits (max.) on investment portfolio held abroadn.a.Currency-matching regulations on assets/liabilities compositionNo more than 20% of the assets of a supplementary pension fund may be denominated in any currency other than Bulgarian leva and euros (according to Article 178, Paragraph 10 of the Social Insurance Code).Investment firms and collective investment fundsIncorporated measures that impose limitations on the composition of the collective investment funds’ investments and other activity requirements are widely defined under Chapter 16 on Open-Ended Investment Companies and Contractual Funds of the Law on Public Offering of Securities. The financial instruments in which investment firms and collective investment funds can invest are included in Article 195 of the Law on Public Offering of Securities. Investments in local and foreign securities are not treated differently.
Limitations exist concerning the diversification of investment portfolios of collective investment schemes (Article 195 of the Law on Public Offering of Securities), which are the same for residents and nonresidents.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksInsurance Code; Social Insurance Code; Law on Public Offering of Securities.

Exchange MeasuresRestrictions and/or multiple currency practices
International security restrictionsNo restrictions as reported in the latest staff report as of December 31, 2006.Other security restrictionsA framework has been established at the WAEMU regional level to combat the financing of terrorism in the member states of the union. The framework facilitates the enforcement of the decisions on the freezing of funds made by the Sanctions Committee of the UN
Security Council, based on the list of persons and entities established by that committee.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksRegulation 14/2002/CM/UEMOA of September 19, 2002, on Freezing Funds and Other Financial Resources as Part of the Fight Against the Financing of Terrorism in WAEMU Member States; www.uemoa.int/actes/Default.htm; www.bceao.int.
Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Burkina Faso is the CFA franc.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Conventional pegged arrangementBurkina Faso participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris foreign exchange market visà-vis the euro. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the WAEMU countries has been reclassified to the category conventional pegged arrangement from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change, and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members.Exchange taxA symmetrical bank commission of 0.3% applies to transfers to all countries outside the WAEMU. The proceeds of this commission must be surrendered in their entirety to the treasury. In addition, banks are allowed to charge an exchange commission of up to 2% on over-the-counter exchange for euros.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketResidents are authorized to contract forward exchange cover for payments related to imports and exports of goods and services. Forward cover may be contracted only in the currency of settlement stipulated in the commercial contract. Maturities must correspond to the due date of the import or export payment stipulated in the commercial contract.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksTreaty of November 14, 1973, establishing the West African Monetary Union (WAMU);

Controls on the use of domestic currency
For capital transactionsBurkina Faso is linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account, through which settlements with France, Monaco, and other Operations Account countries (WAEMU and CAEMC member countries and the Comoros) are made in euros or in the currency of any other Operations Account country. Settlements outside the Operations Account may be conducted freely in CFA francs.Transactions in derivatives and other instrumentsYes.Use of foreign exchange among residents
Payments arrangements
Bilateral payments arrangementsThe CFA franc is the only legal tender, and residents are not permitted to use foreign exchange for domestic transactions.InoperativeYes.Regional arrangementsAn Operations Account is maintained with the French Treasury that links Operations Account countries. All purchases or sales of foreign currencies or euros against CFA francs are ultimately settled through a debit or credit to the Operations Account.Clearing agreementsA multilateral clearing agreement exists in the context of the WAMA among the countries of the WAEMU, Cape Verde, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. All payments related to current transactions between the member bank countries may be effected under the clearing arrangements. However, this excludes transactions specified by the committee of governors of the CBs of ECOWAS member countries and payments related to the exportation from the country of a member bank to the country of another member bank of finished products originating in countries whose CB or monetary authority is not a member of the WAMA.Administration of control
Payments arrearsExchange control is administered jointly by the MOF and the BCEAO. Most of the authority to supervise foreign exchange transactions is delegated to authorized banks, which are required to report these operations to the MOF. The BCEAO is also authorized to collect— either directly or through banks, financial institutions, the postal administration, or judicial agents—any information necessary to compile balance of payments statistics. Customs officers monitor outflows of foreign exchange and confirm import and export of goods. All residents of WAEMU countries are treated as residents of Burkina Faso for the purposes of financial transactions. All foreign exchange operations with foreign countries must be effected through authorized intermediary banks, the postal administration, or the BCEAO.
No supporting documents are required for transfers of up to the equivalent of
CFAF 300,000. Within the framework of the regional financial market, the placement and soliciting of foreign and domestic securities in Burkina Faso require prior authorization by the RCPSFM.Private
Controls on trade in gold (coins and/or bullion)n.a.On external tradeImports of gold require prior MOF authorization. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports by or on behalf of the treasury or the BCEAO; (2) imports of manufactured articles containing minor quantities of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles); and (3) imports by travelers of gold objects up to a combined weight of 500 grams. Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Exports of gold have been liberalized.Controls on exports and imports of banknotes On exports
Domestic currencyCFA franc banknotes may be exported freely by travelers. CFA banknotes may be freely sent from authorized intermediaries to their correspondents. However, the suspension of BCEAO repurchases of exported banknotes continues. Similarly, by implementing this measure, authorized intermediaries are not allowed to receive the CFA banknotes sent by their correspondents.Foreign currency
On importsThe reexportation of foreign banknotes by nonresident travelers is allowed up to the equivalent of CFAF 500,000; the reexportation of foreign banknotes above this ceiling requires documentation demonstrating either the importation of the foreign banknotes or their purchase against other means of payment registered in the name of the traveler or through the use of nonresident deposit accounts in local banks.Foreign currencyResidents and nonresidents may bring in any amount of foreign banknotes and coins (except gold coins) of countries outside the Operations Account area. Residents bringing in foreign banknotes and foreign currency traveler’s checks exceeding the equivalent of CFAF 300,000 must declare them to customs on entry and sell them to an authorized intermediary bank within eight days. Nonresident travelers must declare to customs foreign currency exceeding the equivalent of CFAF 1 million on entry and exit.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksRegulation 09/98/CM/UEMOA of December 20, 1998; www.bceao.int; www.uemoa.int.

The opening of the account is subject to presentation of documents by nonresidents proving their status and actual residence.
Domestic currency accountsBecause the BCEAO has suspended the repurchase of banknotes circulating outside the WAEMU area, banknotes issued by the BCEAO or an issuer holding an operations account with the French Treasury may not be deposited to nonresident accounts. These accounts may not be overdrawn without prior MOF authorization. Transfers of funds between nonresident accounts are not restricted.Convertible into foreign currencyConvertible foreign currency accounts may be debited freely for the purchase by nonresidents of foreign currencies on the official exchange market.Blocked accountsNo.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksRegulation 09/98/CM/UEMOA of December 20, 1998; www.bceao.int; www.uemoa.int.

The ASI is granted for a minimum import quota of 2,000 metric tons.Other nontariff measuresA technical import visa (certificat de conformité) is required for the following products: reinforcing steel, sheet metal, adhesives for cold vulcanization (dissolution), carbide, electrical batteries, polyethylene and polypropylene bags for packing, mopeds, motorcycles having an engine capacity of less than 125 cm², tires and inner tubes for cycles, aerosol insecticides, mosquito-repellent coils, pesticides, bleach, cosmetic products and perfume, gas cylinders, pharmaceutical alcohol, butter and margarine, cooking salt, edible vegetable oils, food pastes, granulated sugar or sugar cubes, mayonnaise, mustard, seasoning cubes and flavoring, vinegar, wheat and cereal flour, yeast and additives for bread making, canned food, cookies, rice, beer, liquor, milk, tea and coffee, sodas, wine, and tobacco or tobacco products of any kind.Import taxes and/or tariffsThe CET of the WAEMU consists of four rates (zero, 5%, 10%, and 20%). Imports are also subject to a statistical fee of 1% and a community solidarity levy of 1%. In addition, a cyclical import tax and a degressive protection tax may be levied on certain products for a set period of time.

BURUNDI
(Position as of December 31, 2006)
Status under IMF Articles of Agreement
Article XIVYes.
Exchange MeasuresRestrictions and/or multiple currency practices
International security restrictionsThe staff report for the 2006 Article IV consultation with Burundi states that as of July 5,
2006, Burundi maintained two multiple currency practices inconsistent with Article VIII, Section 3, arising from or in connection with the current Dutch auction system, and one exchange restriction inconsistent with Article VIII, Section 2 (a), resulting from the authorization process that is applied to certain current international transactions. One multiple currency practice results from the fact that no mechanism limits the potential variation of winning bids from differentiating from each other by more than 2 percent. The other multiple currency practice results from the fact that the exchange rate used for government transactions takes place at a rate that may differ by more than 2 percent from market exchange rates. The exchange restriction results from the central bank having discretion to refuse to authorize the sale of foreign exchange for reasons other than in connection with verifying the bona fide nature of the transaction. An exchange restriction was eliminated on May 30, 2006. (Country Report No. 06/311)In accordance with IMF Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51)On May 19, 2006, the authorities notified the IMF that Burundi maintains restrictions on financial transactions and accounts involving terrorist individuals and organizations, pursuant to (1) UN Security Council Resolution No. 1269 (1999) and (2) the updated list of terrorist organizations prepared by the U.S. Department of State.Other security restrictionsYes.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.

Exchange MeasuresRestrictions and/or multiple currency practices
International security restrictionsNo restrictions as reported in the latest staff report as of December 31, 2006.In accordance with IMF Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51)Financial transactions by individuals and organizations associated with terrorism are restricted and blocked, in accordance with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and pursuant to the list of terrorist organizations maintained by the U.S. Secretary of State.Other security restrictionsIn accordance with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, measures have been taken to block financial transactions by individuals and organizations associated with terrorism.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.
Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency issued within the CAEMC, which is legal tender in Cameroon and the other member countries, is the CFA franc.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Conventional pegged arrangementCameroon participates in a currency union with five other members of the CAEMC and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange transactions in euros between the BEAC and commercial banks are made at the same rate. Buying and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also officially posted, with quotations based on the fixed rate for the euro and the rates in the Paris exchange market for the currencies concerned. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange regime of the CAEMC countries has been reclassified to the category conventional pegged arrangement from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change, and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members.Exchange taxA commission of 0.5%, excluding VAT, is levied on all transfers to countries that are not members of the BEAC, except those made for the account of the treasury and for the expenses of students. For other transactions, commercial banks collect commissions at a rate they each set freely. Commissions are not levied on the following: (1) government exchange transactions, (2) transfers linked to import settlements covered by import declarations by domicile banks, (3) payments due on debt regularly contracted, (4) travel allowances, and (5) representation expenses during official missions.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketThe CAEMC area does not have a forward exchange market.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.
Arrangements for Payments and Receipts
Prescription of currency requirements
Controls on the use of domestic Within the CAEMC, the CFA franc is used freely for payments and receipts in current and currency capital transactions and payments. Settlement with all countries other than CAEMC member
states must be made through correspondent banks, in one of the currencies of the two parties or in any other currency accepted by the two parties to the transaction.
Payments arrangements
Regional arrangements	An Operations Account is maintained with the French Treasury that links all Operations Account countries. All purchases and sales of foreign currencies and euros against CFA francs are ultimately settled through a debit or credit to the Operations Account. Exchange regulations of CAEMC member countries are harmonized.
Administration of control	The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) is responsible for administering foreign exchange regulations and may delegate all or a portion of its power to the BEAC, to the Banking Commission in Central Africa (COBAC), and to authorized intermediaries.
Authorized intermediaries are usually delegated to administer foreign transactions and are responsible for checking the validity of transactions, collecting statistics, and reporting to the monetary authorities. The tasks delegated must not include some types of transactions. The BEAC ensures exchange regulation surveillance, evaluates cover against exchange risk, studies matters for which advice may be requested when foreign exchange accounts are opened by some resident legal entities, and monitors the repatriation of export proceeds. COBAC must ensure that the authorized intermediaries comply with the specific provisions of these regulations to ensure that they are properly implemented and do not destabilize the CAEMC banking system.
Payments arrears	No.
Controls on trade in gold (coins and/or bullion)
On domestic ownership and/or trade Residents are free to hold, purchase, and sell gold jewelry in Cameroon. To hold gold in any other form, authorization is required from the Ministry of Mines, Water Resources, and Power (MOMWRP). Authorization is generally granted only to industrial users, including jewelers. Newly extracted gold must be reported to the MOMWRP.
On external trade	With the exception of manufactured articles containing a small quantity of gold, imports and exports of gold outside the CAEMC are subject to the prior authorization of the MOMWRP. The national treasuries and the BEAC are exempt from such authorization.
Controls on exports and imports of banknotes
On exports
Domestic currency Exports of CFA francs issued by the BEAC outside the CAEMC area are prohibited. When traveling outside the CAEMC, travelers must use means of payment other than BEAC banknotes. Nevertheless, resident travelers may carry with them a maximum of CFAF 100,000 when exiting the CAEMC.
Foreign currency Resident or nonresident travelers crossing the borders of the CAEMC must, on entry or exit, declare to customs their foreign currency, securities, or assets in amounts exceeding CFAF 1 million. When leaving the CAEMC, nonresident travelers may take with them foreign currency up to a maximum equivalent to the amount they declared on entry to the
CAEMC.
On imports
Domestic currency	Imports of CFA francs issued by the BEAC outside the CAEMC area are prohibited. Resident travelers may import up to CFAF 100,000 on entry to the CAEMC.
Foreign currency	Resident and nonresident travelers of the CAEMC may import banknotes and coins issued
by any other bank of issue, without restriction, but must file a customs declaration for any currency or securities exceeding CFAF 1 million.

Negative listImport permits are required for the importation of certain agricultural products, certain endangered species of fauna and flora, natural gas, material and equipment for the production or use of atomic energy, certain military armaments, and certain internationally controlled drugs. In addition, Health Canada does not permit the importation of unregistered drugs. Commercial imports of used motor vehicles (less than 15 years old) have been generally prohibited, except from the United States. The prohibition on imports of used vehicles from Mexico will be phased out by January 1, 2019.Open general licensesYes.Licenses with quotasImport controls under the WTO ATC no longer apply.Other nontariff measuresMeasures consistent with international trade obligations (e.g., countervailing duties) are in effect. Antidumping duties are imposed, taking into consideration competition policy factors as well as other economic costs.Import taxes and/or tariffsOn average, import tariff rates are low. Canada’s trade-weighted average tariff rate for all products, including agriculture, has been less than 1% since 1998, due in large part to dutyfree access provided by the 1988 Canada–U.S. Free Trade Agreement. Free trade agreements with Mexico (under NAFTA) and with Chile, Israel, and Costa Rica, as well as the extension of the General Preferential Tariff and duty-free, quota-free access under the Least Developed Country Tariff, have led to further tariff reductions. The highest tariff rates are applied to a limited number of over-quota, supply-managed agricultural products (dairy, poultry, and eggs). Canada’s other import-sensitive sectors include textiles, apparel, footwear, and ships.State import monopolyCertain monopolies exist at the federal level.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksExport and Import Permits Act; Customs Tariff; Special Import Measures Act.

Export taxesThe Export Control List identifies all goods that are controlled to implement intergovernmental arrangements, maintain supplies, or ensure security. It includes all items identified in various international export control regime lists. In addition, controls are maintained for supply reasons to ensure the orderly export marketing of certain products that are subject to import limitations by other countries, to promote further processing in Canada (e.g., of logs and herring roe), and for nonproliferation purposes (i.e., chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons and their delivery systems). The Area Control List includes countries to which all exports are controlled. At present, Belarus (effective December 14, 2006) and Myanmar are on the Area Control List. Permits are required for the exportation of listed goods to all countries except, in most cases, the United States, as well as for all goods destined for countries on the Area Control List, unless otherwise exempted.Other export taxesSince 1994, Canada maintains an export tax on some tobacco products. This export tax is administered under the Excise Act, 2001.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksExport and Import Permits Act; Excise Act, 2001.Payments for Invisible Transactions and Current Transfers

In addition, under provisions of the Investment Canada Act (ICA), the acquisition of a Canadian business by a non-Canadian and the establishment of a new business by a non-Canadian are both subject to notification. Under some circumstances, the investment may be reviewable.Acquisitions in one of four sensitive sectors (cultural industries, transportation services, some financial services, and uranium production) are reviewable for all direct acquisitions over $5 million and indirect investments over $50 million. These same thresholds apply for acquisitions in nonsensitive sectors, provided both the acquirer and seller of the Canadian business are not members of the WTO.
Direct acquisitions in nonsensitive sectors by investors from WTO members are reviewable only if the assets of the Canadian business are greater than $281 million (this threshold is adjusted every year to reflect economic growth in Canada). Indirect acquisitions by WTO members in the nonsensitive sectors are not reviewable.
A direct acquisition occurs when a non-Canadian directly acquires a Canadian business. An indirect acquisition occurs when a non-Canadian acquires a business outside of Canada and that business has a subsidiary in Canada.
Decisions to allow an investment are based on “net benefit” to Canada. The factors of net benefit to Canada are set out in Section 21 of the ICA. Decisions regarding noncultural industries are made by the minister of industry. The minister of Canadian heritage makes Controls on liquidation of direct investment

Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency issued within the CAEMC, which is legal tender in the Central African Republic and the other member countries, is the CFA franc.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Conventional pegged arrangementThe Central African Republic participates in a currency union with five other members of the CAEMC and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange transactions in euros between the BEAC and commercial banks are made at the same rate. Buying and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also officially posted, with quotations based on the fixed rate for the euro and the rates in the Paris exchange market for the currencies concerned. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange regime of the CAEMC countries has been reclassified to the category conventional pegged arrangement from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change, and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members.Exchange taxA commission of 0.5%, excluding VAT, is levied on all transfers to countries that are not members of the BEAC, except those made for the account of the treasury and for the expenses of students.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketThe CAEMC area does not have a forward exchange market.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.Arrangements for Payments and Receipts

states must be made through correspondent banks, in one of the currencies of the two parties or in any other currency accepted by the two parties to the transaction.
Payments arrangements
Regional arrangementsAn Operations Account is maintained with the French Treasury that links Operations Account countries. All purchases and sales of foreign currencies and euros against CFA francs are ultimately settled through a debit or credit to the Operations Account. Exchange regulations of member countries in the CAEMC are harmonized.Administration of controlThe Ministry of Finance and Budget (MOFB) is responsible for administering foreign exchange regulations and may delegate all or a portion of its power to the BEAC, to the Banking Commission in Central Africa (COBAC), and to authorized intermediaries.
Authorized intermediaries are usually delegated to administer foreign transactions and are responsible for checking the validity of transactions, collecting statistics, and reporting to the monetary authorities. The tasks delegated must not include some types of transactions. The BEAC ensures exchange regulation surveillance, evaluates cover against exchange risk, studies matters for which advice may be requested when foreign exchange accounts are opened by some resident legal entities, and monitors the repatriation of export proceeds. COBAC must ensure that the authorized intermediaries comply with the specific provisions of these regulations to ensure that they are properly implemented and do not destabilize the CAEMC banking system.Payments arrears
Controls on trade in gold (coins and/or bullion)No.On external trade
Controls on exports and imports of banknotes
On exportsImports and exports of gold require a license, which is seldom granted. In practice, imports and exports are made by an authorized purchasing office. Exempt from prior authorization are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the treasury and (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a small quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles). Both licensed and license-free imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Certain companies have been officially appointed as Offices for the Purchase, Import, and Export of Gold and Raw Diamonds, and imports and exports are made by these offices.Domestic currencyExports of CFA francs issued by the BEAC outside the CAEMC area are prohibited. When traveling outside the CAEMC, travelers must use means of payment other than BEAC banknotes. Nevertheless, resident travelers may carry with them a maximum of CFAF 100,000 when exiting the CAEMC.Foreign currency
On importsResident or nonresident travelers crossing the borders of the CAEMC must, on entry or exit, declare to customs their foreign currency, securities, or assets in amounts exceeding CFAF 1 million. When leaving the CAEMC, nonresident travelers may take with them foreign currency up to a maximum equivalent to the amount they declared on entry to the
CAEMC.Domestic currencyImports of CFA francs issued by the BEAC outside the CAEMC area are prohibited. Resident travelers may import up to CFAF 100,000 on entry to the CAEMC.Foreign currencyResident and nonresident travelers of the CAEMC may import banknotes and coins issued by any other bank of issue, without restriction, but must file a customs declaration for any currency or securities exceeding CFAF 1 million.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.Resident Accounts

When payments of imports exceed this threshold, authorized intermediaries must ensure that the transaction is properly settled and also examine the supporting documents. Nevertheless, legally registered legal entities and declared or certified liberal professionals may be exempt from the requirement to produce supporting documents, provided they present an annual estimate of imports corroborated by a business forecast.Domiciliation requirementAll imports exceeding CFAF 5 million must be domiciled with a resident authorized intermediary.Preshipment inspectionPreshipment inspection is required for all imports above CFAF 1 million or its equivalent.Letters of creditn.a.Import licenses used as exchange licensesImport declarations are required for all imports, and the import license entitles importers to purchase the necessary foreign exchange, provided the shipping documents are submitted to the authorized bank.

Indicative thresholds are set according to the type of travel (business, study, leisure, and medical travel, and official missions). However, all substantiated requests are granted, regardless of the amount. Authorized intermediaries are required to serve their customers to the extent that foreign exchange is available, check the validity of the supporting documents presented, and report to the appropriate authorities.Indicative limits/bona fide testTransfers may be made freely on presentation of supporting documents.Foreign workers’ wagesOn presentation of their pay slips, resident foreign workers may be authorized to transfer a portion of their net remuneration outside the CAEMC.Prior approvalYes.Quantitative limitsYes.Indicative limits/bona fide testSupporting documents must be provided.Credit card use abroadThe use of credit cards is similar to a transfer and is not subject to the regulations governing invisible transactions and current transfers.Quantitative limitsThe use of credit cards, which must be issued by resident financial intermediaries and approved by the Ministry for the Economy, Finance, Planning, and International

Exchange MeasuresRestrictions and/or multiple currency practicesNo restrictions as reported in the latest staff report as of December 31, 2006.International security restrictionsNo.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.
Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency issued within the CAEMC, which is legal tender in Chad and the other member countries, is the CFA franc.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Conventional pegged arrangementChad participates in a currency union with five other members of the CAEMC and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange transactions in euros between the BEAC and commercial banks are made at the same rate. Buying and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also officially posted, with quotations based on the fixed rate for the euro and the rates in the Paris exchange market for the currencies concerned. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange regime of the CAEMC countries has been reclassified to the category conventional pegged arrangement from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change, and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members.Exchange taxAll transfers and exchange operations are subject to a commission levied by the treasury. The commission rate amounts to 0.25% in the CFA franc area and 0.5% (excluding VAT) outside the CFA franc area.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketThe CAEMC area does not have a forward exchange market.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.Arrangements for Payments and Receipts
Prescription of currency requirements
Controls on the use of domestic Within the CAEMC, the CFA franc is used freely for payments and receipts in current and currency capital transactions and payments. Settlement with all countries other than CAEMC member
states must be made through correspondent banks, in one of the currencies of the two parties or in any other currency accepted by the two parties to the transaction.
Payments arrangements
Regional arrangementsAn Operations Account is maintained with the French Treasury that links all Operations Account countries. All purchases or sales of foreign currencies or euros against CFA francs are ultimately settled through a debit or credit to the Operations Account. The exchange regulations of CAEMC member countries are harmonized.Administration of controlThe Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) is responsible for administering foreign exchange regulations and may delegate all or a portion of its power to the BEAC, to the Banking Commission in Central Africa (COBAC), and to authorized intermediaries.
Authorized intermediaries are usually delegated to administer foreign transactions and are responsible for checking the validity of transactions, collecting statistics, and reporting to the monetary authorities. The tasks delegated must not include some types of transactions. The BEAC ensures exchange regulation surveillance, evaluates cover against exchange risk, studies matters for which advice may be requested when foreign exchange accounts are opened by some resident legal entities, and monitors the repatriation of export proceeds. COBAC must ensure that the authorized intermediaries comply with the specific provisions of these regulations to ensure that they are properly implemented and do not destabilize the CAEMC banking system.Payments arrears

Status under IMF Articles of Agreement
Article VIIIDate of acceptance: December 1, 1996.
Exchange MeasuresRestrictions and/or multiple currency practices
International security restrictionsNo restrictions as reported in the latest staff report as of December 31, 2006.In accordance with IMF Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51)Measures have been taken to freeze the accounts and assets of listed individuals, groups, and organizations associated with terrorism. These measures were taken in accordance with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions.Other security restrictionsYes.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.
Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of the People’s Republic of China is the Chinese renminbi. The currency unit is the yuan.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Crawling pegThe exchange rate of the renminbi is determined with reference to an undisclosed basket of currencies. Daily fluctuations in the renminbi–U.S. dollar exchange rate are limited to ±0.3% around a central rate set by the People’s Bank of China based on the market closing rate of the previous day. Daily fluctuations of the renminbi against other currencies are limited to
±3%.Effective January 4, 2006, the method for determining the renminbi–U.S. dollar mid-rate is as follows: the China Foreign Exchange Trade System, before the daily interbank foreign exchange market opening quote, asks for quotes from all the market makers of the interbank foreign exchange market and makes the quoted prices of the market makers the calculation sample for the renminbi–U.S. dollar exchange rate mid-rate. After eliminating the highest and lowest quotes, it takes a weighted average of the remaining market makers’ quotes and obtains the daily renminbi–U.S. dollar foreign exchange mid-rate. The weighting is on a composite of indicators, such as the trading volume of quoting parties in the interbank foreign exchange market and the circumstances of the quotations. As of December 2006, 15 banks had been introduced to be market makers in foreign exchange. The U.S. dollar spot exchange bid-offer rate between designated foreign exchange banks and their customers may not exceed 1% of the benchmark rate, and spread on cash may not exceed 4%. Banks and their customers may negotiate their exchange and cash rates, but the negotiated rate of renminbi per dollar may not exceed the specified price range. On July 21, 2005, China announced a 2.1% revaluation of the renminbi–U.S. dollar exchange rate and a change in its exchange rate arrangement to allow the value of the renminbi to fluctuate based on market supply and demand with reference to an undisclosed basket of currencies. To permit a greater role for market forces in determining the renminbi exchange rate, steps have been taken since July 2005 to liberalize and develop China’s foreign exchange markets, including the establishment of an over-the-counter spot foreign exchange market and markets for currency swaps and futures. Since the July 2005 revaluation, the exchange rate appreciated by about 5% until end-April 2007, while the rate has remained in a 2% crawling band. The observed path of the exchange rate and information on intervention and reserves buildup suggest that the exchange rate is determined mainly by official action, resulting in a classification as a crawling peg, effective August 1, 2006.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO
(Position as of December 31, 2006)
Status under IMF Articles of Agreement
Article VIIIDate of acceptance: February 10, 2003.
Exchange MeasuresRestrictions and/or multiple currency practicesThe staff report for the Staff Monitored Program states that as July 5, 2006, the Democratic Republic of the Congo maintained measures that give rise to one restriction and one multiple currency practice (MCP) subject to Fund approval under Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. The exchange restriction involves an outstanding net debit position vis-à-vis other contracting members under the inoperative regional payments agreement with the Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries (CEPGL). The multiple currency practice involves a fixed exchange rate set on a quarterly basis applying to transactions through the bilateral payments agreement (BPA) with Zimbabwe. (Country Report No. 06/259)International security restrictionsNo.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.
Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the Congo franc.Exchange rate structure

The Central Bank of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (BCC) publishes the daily average exchange rate, which is based on the combined average of the amounts and rates applied in market transactions, as reported by exchange bureaus and banks. The BCC, while observing the international reserves target in the monetary program, intervenes to smooth exchange rate fluctuations, but not against market fundamentals. Charges or commissions are not assessed on interbank market transactions. In their transactions with customers, commercial banks and financial institutions may charge an exchange commission not exceeding 1%. The spread between the buying and selling rates for foreign banknotes set by the commercial banks and financial institutions in the foreign exchange market must not exceed 5%.Exchange taxA charge of 0.02% is levied by the BCC on any payment made or received by licensed banks, to or from abroad, irrespective of the status of the originator or the beneficiary.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketExchange market participants may engage in spot and/or forward operations. Forward operations are completed on contract maturity. Congo franc equivalents for exchange transactions are calculated at rates agreed to between contracting parties. They are paid on the agreed date and, by choice of the contracting parties, through a clearinghouse, credit to an account, or cash payment. The contractual maturity of forward operations must take account of holidays in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and abroad.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksLaw No. 67/272 of June 23, 1967, Defining the Regulatory Authority of the Central Bank in Exchange Matters; Law No. 05/2002 of May 7, 2002, on the Establishment, Organization, and Operation of the BCC; Democratic Republic of the Congo Exchange Regulations of February 13, 2003; Agreement Organizing the Exchange Market in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.Arrangements for Payments and Receipts

REPUBLIC OF CONGO
(Position as of January 31, 2007)
Status under IMF Articles of Agreement
Article VIIIDate of acceptance: June 1, 1996.
Exchange MeasuresRestrictions and/or multiple currency practicesNo restrictions as reported in the latest staff report as of December 31, 2006.International security restrictionsNo.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.
Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency issued within the CAEMC, which is legal tender in the Republic of Congo and the other member countries, is the CFA franc.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Conventional pegged arrangementThe Republic of Congo participates in a currency union with five other members of the CAEMC and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange transactions in euros between the BEAC and commercial banks are made at the same rate. Buying and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also officially posted, with quotations based on the fixed rate for the euro and the rates in the Paris exchange market for the currencies concerned. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange regime of the CAEMC countries has been reclassified to the category conventional pegged arrangement from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change, and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members.Exchange taxEffective payments destined to all countries are subject to a commission of 1% (exclusive of VAT), with a minimum charge of CFAF 75. Exempt from this commission are payments of the state, the Postal and Telecommunications Administration, and the BEAC member countries; salaries of Congolese diplomats abroad; expenditures of official missions abroad; scholarships of individuals studying or training abroad; payments made on behalf of individuals for purchases of books and periodicals not intended for sale; and debt-service payments due from companies that have entered into an agreement with the Republic of Congo.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketThe CAEMC area does not have a forward exchange market.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.Arrangements for Payments and Receipts
Prescription of currency requirements
Controls on the use of domestic Within the CAEMC, the CFA franc is used freely for payments and receipts in current and currency capital transactions and payments. Settlement with all countries other than CAEMC member
states must be made through correspondent banks, in one of the currencies of the two parties or in any other currency accepted by the two parties to the transaction.
Payments arrangements
Regional arrangements	An Operations Account is maintained with the French Treasury that links all Operations Account countries. All purchases and sales of foreign currencies and euros against CFA francs are ultimately settled through a debit or credit to the Operations Account. Exchange regulations of CAEMC member countries are harmonized.
Administration of control The Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Budget (MEFB) is responsible for administering foreign exchange regulations and may delegate all or a portion of its power to the BEAC, to the Banking Commission in Central Africa (COBAC), and to authorized intermediaries. Authorized intermediaries are usually delegated to administer foreign transactions and are responsible for checking the validity of transactions, collecting statistics, and reporting to the monetary authorities. The tasks delegated must not include some types of transactions. The BEAC ensures exchange regulation surveillance, evaluates cover against exchange risk, studies matters for which advice may be requested when foreign exchange accounts are opened by some resident legal entities, and monitors the repatriation of export proceeds. COBAC must ensure that the authorized intermediaries comply with the specific provisions of these regulations to ensure that they are properly implemented and do not destabilize the CAEMC banking system.
Payments arrears	No.
Controls on trade in gold (coins and/or bullion)
On domestic ownership and/or trade Residents are free to hold gold in the form of coins, art objects, or jewelry; however, to hold gold in any other form, prior authorization of the MEFB is required.
On external trade	Prior authorization of the MEFB is required to import or export gold in any form. Exempt
from the authorization requirement are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the treasury or the BEAC and (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a small quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles). Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. There are no official exports of gold.
Controls on exports and imports of banknotes
On exports
Domestic currency Exports of CFA francs issued by the BEAC outside the CAEMC area are prohibited. When traveling outside the CAEMC, travelers must use means of payment other than BEAC banknotes. Nevertheless, resident travelers may carry with them a maximum of CFAF 100,000 when exiting the CAEMC.
Foreign currency Resident or nonresident travelers crossing the borders of the CAEMC must, on entry or exit, declare to customs their foreign currency, securities, or assets in amounts exceeding CFAF 1 million. When leaving the CAEMC, nonresident travelers may take with them foreign currency up to a maximum equivalent to the amount they declared on entry to the
CAEMC.
On imports
Domestic currency	Imports of CFA francs issued by the BEAC outside the CAEMC area are prohibited. Resident travelers may import up to CFAF 100,000 on entry to the CAEMC.
Foreign currency	Resident and nonresident travelers of the CAEMC may import banknotes and coins issued
by any other bank of issue, without restriction, but must file a customs declaration for any currency or securities exceeding CFAF 1 million.

COSTA RICA
(Position as of January 31, 2007)
Status under IMF Articles of Agreement
Article VIIIDate of acceptance: February 1, 1965.
Exchange MeasuresRestrictions and/or multiple currency practicesNo restrictions as reported in the latest staff report as of December 31, 2006.International security restrictionsNo.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.
Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Costa Rica is the Costa Rican colón.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Crawling bandThe external value of the colón is determined in the interbank market. Effective November 20, 2006, foreign exchange trading among authorized traders occurs in the organized electronic foreign exchange market, MONEX (previously, foreign exchange operations were carried out on the MONED), where the Banco Central de Costa Rica (BCCR) carries out its intervention operations. A limited amount of foreign exchange trading also takes place directly between authorized institutions outside the MONEX.Foreign currency buying and selling transactions of the nonbank public sector are carried out directly with the BCCR or through the state commercial banks, depending on the amount of the operation, at exchange rates set by the BCCR for that purpose. The exchange rates applied represent the weighted average daily rate resulting from BCCR transactions on the foreign exchange market to meet the net requirements of the institutions involved, even though the BCCR may, in special circumstances, supply them from its international monetary reserves at the average wholesale market price. Public institutions wishing to hold foreign currency are required to obtain authorization from the BCCR with regard to amounts and annual limits.
In addition, institutions authorized to operate on the foreign exchange market are free to set buying and selling rates for transactions with the public. Those rates must be the rates actually used in transactions, i.e., including any surcharge or additional cost, so that they reflect the final price negotiated by the customer. Previously, in the crawling peg regime, effective January 2006, the rate of crawl of the colón was set on the basis of expected rather than past inflation of Costa Rica’s 19 principal trading partners. Effective March 16, 2006, the BCCR changed its policy interest rate from the 30-day deposit rate to the overnight deposit rate. Effective April 21, 2006, a bid-ask spread of C 0.75 was imposed on transactions with authorized institutions on the MONED.
On October 17, 2006, the BCCR replaced the crawling peg with a crawling band. The band is defined in terms of colones per $1, and had an initial width of 3%. The edges of the band are periodically adjusted. As of October 17, 2006, the floor was set at C 514.78 per $1, and the ceiling was set at C 530.22 per $1.
The floor was adjusted up by C 0.06 and the ceiling by C 0.14 every working day, resulting in an upward crawl of 2.9% and 6.7% a year, respectively. No central parity is defined in the new foreign exchange system. The BCCR reserves the right to change the rate of crawl, if such a need arises owing to financial and macroeconomic conditions. On January 31, 2007, the rate of crawl of the band’s floor was reduced by C 0.06 a day to zero and that of the ceiling by C 0.03 a day to C 0.11, allowing for a faster widening of the band. As a result, the exchange arrangement has been reclassified, effective October 1, 2006, to a crawling band arrangement from a crawling peg.
Exchange tax	In accordance with Article 97 of the Organic Law of the BCCR and Article 5 of the
Regulations on Spot Market Exchange Operations, a fee is charged for participation by ADs in the foreign exchange market. Authorized agents must transfer to the CB 10% of the weighted average margin of intermediation on all foreign exchange transactions. Proceeds must be transferred to the CB by the next working day.
Exchange subsidy	No.
Forward exchange market	No.

CÔTE D’IVOIRE
(Position as of January 31, 2007)
Status under IMF Articles of Agreement
Article VIIIDate of acceptance: June 1, 1996.
Exchange MeasuresRestrictions and/or multiple currency practices
International security restrictionsNo restrictions as reported in the latest staff report as of December 31, 2006.Other security restrictionsA framework has been established at the WAEMU regional level to combat the financing of terrorism in the member states of the union. The framework facilitates the enforcement of the decisions on the freezing of funds made by the Sanctions Committee of the UN
Security Council, based on the list of persons and entities established by that committee.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksRegulation 14/2002/CM/UEMOA by the WAEMU Council of Ministers of September 19, 2002; www.uemoa.int/actes/Default.htm; www.bceao.int.
Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Côte d’Ivoire is the CFA franc.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Conventional pegged arrangementCôte d’Ivoire participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at a fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market vis-à-vis the euro. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the WAEMU countries is reclassified to the category conventional pegged arrangement from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change, and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members.Exchange taxA symmetrical bank commission of 0.3% applies to transfers to all countries outside the WAEMU. The proceeds of this commission must be surrendered in their entirety to the treasury. In addition, banks are allowed to charge an exchange commission of up to 2% on over-the-counter exchange for euros.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketResidents are authorized to contract forward exchange cover for payments related to imports and exports of goods and services. Forward cover may be contracted only in the currency of settlement stipulated in the commercial contract. Maturities must correspond to the due date of the import or export payment stipulated in the commercial contract.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.Arrangements for Payments and Receipts
Prescription of currency Côte d’Ivoire is linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account, through requirements which settlements with France, Monaco, and other Operations Account countries (WAEMU and CAEMC member countries and the Comoros) are made in euros or in the currency of any other Operations Account country. Settlements outside the Operations Account may be conducted freely in CFA francs.
Controls on the use of domestic currency
For capital transactionsTransactions in derivatives and other instrumentsYes.Use of foreign exchange among residents
Payments arrangementsThe CFA franc is the only legal tender, and residents are not permitted to use foreign exchange for domestic transactions.Regional arrangementsAn Operations Account is maintained with the French Treasury that links Operations Account countries. All purchases or sales of foreign currencies or euros against CFA francs are ultimately settled through a debit or credit to the Operations Account.Clearing agreementsA multilateral clearing agreement exists in the context of the WAMA among the countries of the WAEMU, Cape Verde, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. All payments related to current transactions between the member bank countries may be effected under the clearing arrangements. However, this excludes transactions specified by the committee of governors of the CBs of ECOWAS member countries and payments related to the exportation from the country of a member bank to the country of another member bank of finished products originating in countries whose CB or monetary authority is not a member of the WAMA.Administration of control
Payments arrearsExchange control is administered jointly by the Directorate of the Treasury in the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and the BCEAO. Most of the authority to supervise foreign exchange transactions is delegated to authorized banks, which are required to report these operations to the MEF. The BCEAO is also authorized to collect—either directly or through banks, financial institutions, the postal administration, or judicial agents—any information necessary to compile balance of payments statistics. Customs officers monitor outflows of foreign exchange and confirm import and export of goods. All residents of WAEMU countries are treated as residents of Côte d’Ivoire for the purposes of financial transactions. All foreign exchange operations with foreign countries must be effected through authorized intermediary banks, the postal administration, or the BCEAO. No supporting documents are required for transfers of up to the equivalent of CFAF 300,000. Within the framework of the regional financial market, the placement and soliciting of foreign and domestic securities in Côte d’Ivoire require the prior authorization of the RCPSFM.Official
Controls on trade in gold (coins and/or bullion)Yes.On external trade
Controls on exports and imports of banknotes
On exportsImports of gold require prior MEF authorization. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports by or on behalf of the treasury or the BCEAO, (2) imports of manufactured articles containing minor quantities of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles), and (3) imports by travelers of gold objects up to a combined weight of 500 grams. Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Exports of gold have been liberalized.Domestic currencyCFA franc banknotes may be exported freely by travelers. However, the suspension of
BCEAO repurchases of exported banknotes continues. In addition, the exchange of BCEAO banknotes between authorized intermediaries and their correspondents outside the WAEMU is prohibited.
Foreign currency
On importsThe reexportation of foreign banknotes by nonresident travelers is allowed up to the equivalent of CFAF 500,000; the reexportation of foreign banknotes above this ceiling requires documentation demonstrating either the importation of the foreign banknotes or their purchase against other means of payment registered in the name of the traveler or through the use of nonresident deposit accounts in local banks.Domestic currencyResidents are free to import domestic currency. The sending of BCEAO banknotes between licensed intermediary banks and their correspondent banks located outside the WAEMU is strictly prohibited.Foreign currencyResidents and nonresidents may bring in any amount of foreign banknotes and coins (except gold coins) of countries outside the Operations Account area. Residents bringing in foreign banknotes and foreign currency traveler’s checks exceeding the equivalent of CFAF 300,000 must declare them to customs on entry and sell them to an authorized intermediary bank within eight days. Nonresident travelers must declare to customs foreign currency exceeding the equivalent of CFAF 1 million on entry and exit.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksRegulation R09/98/CM/UEMOA of December 20, 1998; www.bceao.int.

These accounts may not be overdrawn without prior MEF authorization.
Transfers of funds between nonresident accounts are not restricted.Convertible into foreign currencyConvertible foreign currency accounts may be debited freely for the purchase by nonresidents of foreign currencies on the official exchange market.

Banks are required to deposit the 40% reserve requirement in an unremunerated foreign exchange account of the CNB. Effective January 11, 2006, a second-tier marginal reserve requirement of 15% is applied to the increase in nonresidents’ funds over their level of November 2005; a third-tier marginal reserve requirement of 55% is applied to the increase in guarantees and warranties for the accounts of foreign persons, in kuna and foreign currency, serving as a basis for the foreign borrowing of domestic persons.

Kuna and foreign exchange components of the calculation are determined separately. Fifty percent of the calculated foreign reserve requirement is included in the calculated kuna reserve requirement. Seventy percent of reserve requirements are allocated to the kuna component. The percentage for allocating the foreign exchange component of reserve requirements calculated on the basis of foreign exchange funds of nonresidents and foreign exchange funds received from legal persons in a special relationship with a bank is 100%; the percentage for allocating the remaining portion of the foreign exchange component of reserve requirements is 60%.
The rate of remuneration for the deposited kuna component of required reserves is 0.75%.

Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the ECCU countries has been reclassified to the category currency board arrangement from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender.

Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency issued within the CAEMC, which is legal tender in Equatorial Guinea and the other member countries, is the CFA franc.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Conventional pegged arrangementEquatorial Guinea participates in a currency union with five other members of the CAEMC and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange transactions in euros between the BEAC and commercial banks are made at the same rate. Buying and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also officially posted, with quotations based on the fixed rate for the euro and the rates in the Paris exchange market for the currencies concerned. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange regime of the CAEMC countries has been reclassified to the category conventional pegged arrangement from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change, and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members.Exchange taxA commission of 0.5%, excluding VAT, is levied on transfers to countries that are not members of the BEAC. This commission is not levied on transfers relating to central and local government operations, payments for imports covered by a duly issued license and domiciled with a bank, scheduled repayments on loans properly contracted abroad, travel allowances paid by the government and its agencies for official missions, and payments of insurance premiums.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketThe CAEMC area does not have a forward exchange market.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.Arrangements for Payments and Receipts

states must be made through correspondent banks, in one of the currencies of the two parties or in any other currency accepted by the two parties to the transaction.
Payments arrangements
Regional arrangements	An Operations Account is maintained with the French Treasury that links all Operations
Account countries. All purchases or sales of foreign currencies or euros against CFA francs are ultimately settled through a debit or credit to the Operations Account. Exchange regulations of CAEMC member countries are harmonized.
Administration of control	The Ministry of Economy, Commerce, and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (MECSMSE) is responsible for administering foreign exchange regulations and may delegate all or a portion of its power to the BEAC, to the Banking Commission in Central Africa (COBAC), and to authorized intermediaries.
Authorized intermediaries are usually delegated to administer foreign transactions and are responsible for checking the validity of transactions, collecting statistics, and reporting to the monetary authorities. The tasks delegated must not include some types of transactions. The BEAC ensures exchange regulation surveillance, evaluates cover against exchange risk, studies matters for which advice may be requested when foreign exchange accounts are opened by some resident legal entities, and monitors the repatriation of export proceeds. COBAC must ensure that the authorized intermediaries comply with the specific provisions of these regulations to ensure that they are properly implemented and do not destabilize the CAEMC banking system.
Payments arrears	No.
Controls on trade in gold (coins and/or bullion)
On domestic ownership and/or trade	Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in CAEMC member countries. Newly mined gold must be declared to the Ministry of Mining (MM), which authorizes either its exportation or its sale in the domestic market.
On external trade Imports or exports of gold from or to countries outside the CAEMC are subject to authorization by the MM. Exempt from the requirement of MM authorization are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a small quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles). Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration.
Controls on exports and imports of banknotes

Domestic currency Exports of CFA francs issued by the BEAC outside the CAEMC area are prohibited. When traveling outside the CAEMC, travelers must use means of payment other than BEAC banknotes. Nevertheless, resident travelers may carry with them a maximum of CFAF 100,000 when exiting the CAEMC.
Foreign currency Resident or nonresident travelers crossing the borders of the CAEMC must, on entry or exit, declare to customs their foreign currency, securities, or assets in amounts exceeding CFAF 1 million. When leaving the CAEMC, nonresident travelers may take with them foreign currency up to a maximum equivalent to the amount they declared on entry to the

Nevertheless, legally registered legal entities and declared or certified liberal professionals may be exempt from therequirement to produce supporting documents, provided they present an annual estimate of imports corroborated by a business forecast.

Insurance companiesEffective December 29, 2006, the relevant EU legislation applies.Limits (max.) on securities issued by nonresidentsIn general, there is no differential treatment of securities issued by nonresidents of other sectors. General investment limits on securities are the following: (1) assets covering technical provisions may be invested in securities of one issuer or in loans secured by one borrower in an amount of up to 5% of the total amount of technical provisions together with the reinsurer’s share and in an amount of up to 10%, provided neither the proportion of securities nor the proportion of secured loans in assets covering technical provisions exceeds 40% of the total amount of technical provisions together with the reinsurer’s share; and (2) assets covering technical provisions may be invested in securities not specified in §77 (6) 2) of the Insurance Activities Act that can be sold within a short period of time, and in shares of investment funds not specified in §4 of the Investment Funds Act in an amount of up to 10% of the total amount of technical provisions together with the reinsurer’s share.Limits (max.) on investment portfolio held abroadThere are no specific limits on investment portfolios held abroad just as there are no limits on investment portfolios held locally.Currency-matching regulations on assets/liabilities compositionAn insurer is required to invest assets covering technical provisions corresponding to the commitments arising from insurance contracts in the same currency that the commitment was assumed, unless (1) the assets covering technical provisions corresponding to the commitments assumed in such currency do not exceed 7% of the assets covering technical provisions expressed in other currencies; (2) the assets covering technical provisions corresponding to the commitments assumed in such currency do not exceed 20% of all the commitments of the insurance undertaking expressed in the same currency; (3) the assetscovering technical provisions corresponding to the commitments assumed in Estonian krooni are invested in euros; and (4) the commitment arises from unit-linked life insurance contracts.

An insurer has the right to select a currency in which the insurance payments are to be made in cases where such selection is justified. Such selection is justified, above all, in cases where after conclusion of the contract it will be likely that the commitment must be paid in the same currency in which insurance payments were made and that currency is not the currency of the state where the insured risk is situated.

Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of France is the euro.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Independently floatingFrance participates in a currency union with 12 other members of the EMU and has no separate legal tender. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the EMU countries has been reclassified to the category independently floating from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change, and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members. A fixed conversion rate of CFPF 1,000 per €8.38 applies to the CFP franc, which is the currency of the overseas territories of French Polynesia, New Caledonia, and Wallis and Futuna Islands. Two groups of African countries are linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account: Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo (franc de la Communauté financière africaine, issued by the BCEAO); and Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon (franc de la Coopération financière en Afrique centrale, issued by the BEAC). The fixed parity is CFAF 655.957 per €1.
The Comorian franc, issued by the Central Bank of the Comoros, which holds an Operations Account with the French Treasury, is pegged to the euro at a fixed parity of CF 491.968 per €1.Exchange taxNo.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange market Registered banks in France and Monaco, which may also act on behalf of banks established abroad or in Operations Account countries, are permitted to deal spot or forward in the exchange market in France. Registered banks may also deal spot or forward with their correspondents in foreign markets in all currencies. Nonbank residents may purchase foreign exchange forward with respect to specified transactions. All residents, including private persons, may purchase or sell foreign exchange forward without restriction. Forward sales of foreign currency are not restricted, whether or not they are for hedging purposes.

Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency issued within the CAEMC, which is legal tender in Gabon and the other member countries, is the CFA franc.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Conventional pegged arrangementGabon participates in a currency union with five other members of the CAEMC and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange transactions in euros between the BEAC and commercial banks are made at the same rate. Buying and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also officially posted, with quotations based on the fixed rate for the euro and the rates in the Paris exchange market for the currencies concerned. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange regime of the CAEMC countries has been reclassified to the category conventional pegged arrangement from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change, and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members.Exchange taxCommissions are levied at the rate of 0.5% on transfers made by the banks for their own accounts and on all private capital transfers to countries that are not members of the BEAC, except those made for the account of the treasury, national accounting offices, and private entities granted exemption by the Ministry of Economy, Finance, Budget, and Privatization (MEFBP) because of the nature of their activities.

Prescription of currency requirements
Controls on the use of domestic Within the CAEMC, the CFA franc is used freely for payments and receipts in current and currency capital transactions and payments. Settlement with all countries other than CAEMC member
states must be made through correspondent banks, in one of the currencies of the two parties or in any other currency accepted by the two parties to the transaction.
Payments arrangements
Regional arrangements	An Operations Account is maintained with the French Treasury that links all Operations
Account countries. All purchases or sales of foreign currencies and euros against CFA francs are ultimately settled through a debit or credit to the Operations Account. Exchange regulations of member countries in the CAEMC are harmonized.
Administration of control The MEFBP is responsible for administering foreign exchange regulations and may delegate all or a portion of its power to the BEAC, to the Banking Commission in Central Africa (COBAC), and to authorized intermediaries. Authorized intermediaries are usually delegated to administer foreign transactions and are responsible for checking the validity of transactions, collecting statistics, and reporting to the monetary authorities. The tasks delegated must not include some types of transactions. The BEAC ensures exchange regulation surveillance, evaluates cover against exchange risk, studies matters for which advice may be requested when foreign exchange accounts are opened by some resident legal entities, and monitors the repatriation of export proceeds. COBAC must ensure that the authorized intermediaries comply with the specific provisions of these regulations to ensure that they are properly implemented and do not destabilize the CAEMC banking system.
Payments arrears	No.
Controls on trade in gold (coins and/or bullion)
On domestic ownership and/or trade	Residents may hold, purchase, and sell gold and precious stones of all kinds within the CAEMC.
On external trade	Imports and exports of gold require the authorization of the MEFBP. Exempt from this
requirement are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a small quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles). The exportation of gold is the monopoly of the Société Gabonaise de Recherches et d’Exploitation Minières. Imports of gold exempted from licensing and authorization requirements are subject to customs declaration.
Controls on exports and imports of banknotes
On exports
Domestic currency Exports of CFA francs issued by the BEAC outside the CAEMC area are prohibited. When traveling outside the CAEMC, travelers must use means of payment other than BEAC banknotes. Nevertheless, resident travelers may carry with them a maximum of CFAF 100,000 when exiting the CAEMC.
Foreign currency Resident or nonresident travelers crossing the borders of the CAEMC must, on entry or exit, declare to customs their foreign currency, securities, or assets in amounts exceeding CFAF 1 million. When leaving the CAEMC, nonresident travelers may take with them foreign currency up to a maximum equivalent to the amount they declared on entry to the
CAEMC.
On imports
Domestic currency	Imports of CFA francs issued by the BEAC outside the CAEMC area are prohibited. Resident travelers may import up to CFAF 100,000 on entry to the CAEMC.
Foreign currency	Resident and nonresident travelers of the CAEMC may import banknotes and coins issued
by any other bank of issue, without restriction, but must file a customs declaration for any currency or securities exceeding CFAF 1 million.

Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of The Gambia is the Gambian dalasi.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rateThe exchange rate of the dalasi is determined in the foreign exchange market. The Central Bank of the Gambia (CBG) periodically intervenes in the foreign exchange market by selling and buying foreign exchange. Since 2004, such intervention has been limited to purchasing foreign exchange to augment its international reserves. Commercial banks and foreign exchange bureaus are free to transact among themselves or with customers at exchange rates agreed on by the parties to these transactions. The CBG deals only with commercial banks but conducts a foreign exchange market review session on the last working day of each week with the participation of the commercial banks and foreign exchange bureaus. During this session, the average market rate during the week is announced as the rate applied to government transactions and customs valuations for the following week.
The Gambia participates in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires that the spot exchange rate between the Gambian dalasi and the dollar be maintained within margins of ±15% around the central rate. However, the authorities have not yet implemented these measures.Exchange taxNo.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketNo.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.Arrangements for Payments and Receipts

Weapons may be imported only with the approval of the appropriate department.Open general licensesYes.Other nontariff measuresn.a.Import taxes and/or tariffsGuatemala applies the CET for processed goods from CACM countries, which ranges from zero to 15%; virtually all other intra-CACM trade is exempt from tariffs. The maximum tariff rates on raw materials and intermediate and capital goods not produced in Central America are 5% and 10%, respectively; the tariff rate on raw materials and intermediate and capital goods produced in Central America is zero.
Some processed products, such as coffee, sugar, oil, wheat, and alcohol, that are traded with CACM countries are subject to tariffs ranging from zero to 40%. Guatemala’s tariff structure continues to exempt certain processed products from the maximum CET rate of 15%. The tariff rate for most footwear and textiles is 14%, and rates for tires range from 5% to 15%. In addition, certain agricultural products enjoy safeguard provisions and are subject to tariff rate quotas under WTO rules, which also allow tariffs well above the maximum rate for imports in excess of their quota. Apples are subject to a quota of 11,500 metric tons a year, with tariffs of 12% within quota and 25% in excess of quota, and yellow corn is subject to a quota of 88,670 metric tons a year, with a tariff of zero within quota and 35% in excess of quota. These quotas are adjusted yearly, following discussions between the private sector and the government.
A trade agreement exists among El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico, giving certain tariff benefits to the participants. There is also a trade agreement with the Dominican Republic. The Central America-Dominican Republic-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) came into effect on July 1, 2006. Under this agreement, duties are imposed on 6,307 items divided into different staging categories. Among those, the following categories apply to the goods traded between Guatemala and the United States: (1) category B contains products such as chicken breasts, fish, and vegetables that are being phased in over a five-year term and in 2007 are subject to a duty of 7%; (2) category C contains 788 items whose duties will be eliminated in 10 equal annual phases, beginning January 1 of year one; (3) category D contains those products that will be phased in over a 15-year term and includes dairy products, green coffee, decaffeinated coffee, sugarcane, and alcoholic drinks; for 2007 the duties are 8%, 12%, 16%, and 32%, respectively; (4) category F contains milk and yogurt, which must remain at base rates for years 1 through 10; they will then decrease in 10 equal annual phases and will be duty-free in year 20; the effective duty for 2007 is 15%; (5) duties on goods, such as rum, sausages, and wheat flour, provided for in the items in staging category N must be removed in 12 equal annual phases beginning on the date CAFTA-DR entered into force, and such goods will be duty-free effective January 1 of year 12; the duties foreseen for 2007 for rum, sausages, and wheat flour are 30%, 11.25%, and 7.5%, respectively; (6) duty on black beans provided for in the item in staging category O will remain at base rates for years one through six. On January 1 of year seven, the duty will be reduced by 8% of the base rate, and by an additional 8% of the base rate each year thereafter through year 11. On January 1 of year 12, the duty will be reduced by an additional 15% of the base rate, and by an additional 15% of the base rate each year thereafter through year 14, and such goods shall be duty-free effective January 1 of year 15; and (7) duty-free products for which quota quantities were allocated, such as beef, cheese, milk powder, butter, ice cream, pork, yellow corn, white corn, rice, and chicken leg quarters. The applicable tariffs above quota on these products are 13%–15% for beef, 15% for milk powder, 13%–15% for pork, 28%–35% for yellow corn, 20% for white corn, and 164.4% for chicken leg quarters.State import monopolyNo.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksCentral American Tariff System; www.sieca.org.gt; www.portalsat.gob.gt/portal; Ministry of Economy of Guatemala; www.mineco.gob.gt.

The average rate in commercial banks and authorized exchange houses often differs from the average rate in the informal exchange market by more than 2%. All the official sector transactions are conducted at the reference rate. Effective January 1, 2006, the exchange rate structure was reclassified to dual due to technical correction in the classification.Managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rateThe Central Bank of the Republic of Guinea (CBRG) publishes a daily reference exchange rate, calculated as the weighted average of the rates reported by commercial banks and authorized foreign exchange bureaus.

GUINEA-BISSAU
(Position as of January 31, 2007)
Status under IMF Articles of Agreement
Article VIIIDate of acceptance: January 1, 1997.
Exchange MeasuresRestrictions and/or multiple currency practices
International security restrictionsNo restrictions as reported in the latest staff report as of December 31, 2006.Other security restrictionsA framework has been established at the WAEMU regional level to combat the financing of terrorism in the member states of the union. This framework facilitates the enforcement of the decisions on the freezing of funds made by the Sanctions Committee of the UN
Security Council, based on the list of persons and entities established by that committee.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksRegulation 14/2002/CM/UEMOA by the WAEMU Council of Ministers of September 19, 2002; www.uemoa.int/actes/Default.htm; www.bceao.int.
Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Guinea-Bissau is the CFA franc.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Conventional pegged arrangementGuinea-Bissau participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris foreign exchange market visà-vis the euro. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the WAEMU countries has been reclassified to the category conventional pegged arrangement from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change, and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members.Exchange taxA symmetrical bank commission of 0.3% applies to transfers to all countries outside the WAEMU. The proceeds of this commission must be surrendered in their entirety to the treasury. In addition, banks are allowed to charge an exchange commission of up to 2% on over-the-counter exchange for euros.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketResidents are authorized to contract forward exchange cover for payments related to imports and exports of goods and services. Forward cover may be contracted only in the currency of settlement stipulated in the commercial contract. Maturities must correspond to the due date of the import or export payment stipulated in the commercial contract.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.Arrangements for Payments and Receipts
Prescription of currency Guinea-Bissau is linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account, through requirements which settlements with France, Monaco, and other Operations Account countries (WAEMU and CAEMC member countries and the Comoros) are made in euros or in the currency of any other Operations Account country. Settlements outside the Operations Account may be conducted freely in CFA francs.
Controls on the use of domestic currency
For capital transactionsTransactions in derivatives and other instrumentsYes.Use of foreign exchange among residents
Payments arrangements
Bilateral payments arrangementsThe CFA franc is the only legal tender, and residents are not permitted to use foreign exchange for domestic transactions.InoperativeYes.Regional arrangementsAn Operations Account is maintained with the French Treasury that links Operations Account countries. All purchases or sales of foreign currencies or euros against CFA francs are settled through a debit or credit to the Operations Account.Clearing agreementsA multilateral clearing agreement exists in the context of the WAMA among the countries of the WAEMU, Cape Verde, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. All payments related to current transactions between the member bank countries may be effected under the clearing arrangements. However, this excludes transactions specified by the committee of governors of the CBs of ECOWAS member countries and payments related to the exportation from the country of a member bank to the country of another member bank of finished products originating in countries whose CB or monetary authority is not a member of the WAMA.Administration of control
Payments arrearsExchange control is administered jointly by the Directorate of the Treasury in the MOF and the BCEAO. Most of the authority to supervise foreign exchange transactions is delegated to authorized banks, which are required to report these operations to the MOF. The BCEAO is also authorized to collect—either directly or through banks, financial institutions, the postal administration, or judicial agents—any information necessary to compile balance of payments statistics. Customs officers monitor outflows of foreign exchange and confirm import and export of goods. All residents of WAEMU countries are treated as residents of Guinea-Bissau for the purposes of financial transactions. All foreign exchange operations with foreign countries must be effected through authorized intermediary banks, the postal administration, or the BCEAO. No supporting documents are required for transfers of up to the equivalent of CFAF 300,000. Within the framework of the regional financial market, the placement and soliciting of foreign and domestic securities in Guinea-Bissau require prior authorization by the RCPSFM.OfficialYes.Private
Controls on trade in gold (coins and/or bullion)n.a.On external tradeImports of gold require prior MOF authorization. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports by or on behalf of the treasury or the BCEAO, (2) imports of manufactured articles containing minor quantities of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles), and (3) imports by travelers of gold objects up to a combined weight of 500 grams. Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Exports of gold have been liberalized.Controls on exports and imports of banknotes On exports
Domestic currencyCFA franc banknotes may be exported freely by travelers. However, the suspension of
BCEAO repurchases of exported banknotes continues. In addition, the exchange of BCEAO banknotes between authorized intermediaries and their correspondents outside the WAEMU is prohibited.Foreign currency
On importsThe reexportation of foreign banknotes by nonresident travelers is allowed up to the equivalent of CFAF 500,000; the reexportation of foreign banknotes above this ceiling requires documentation demonstrating either the importation of the foreign banknotes or their purchase against other means of payment registered in the name of the traveler or through the use of nonresident deposit accounts in local banks.Foreign currencyResidents and nonresidents may bring in any amount of foreign banknotes and coins (except gold coins) of countries outside the Operations Account area. Residents bringing in foreign banknotes and foreign currency traveler’s checks exceeding the equivalent of CFAF 300,000 must declare them to customs on entry and sell them to an authorized intermediary bank within eight days. Nonresident travelers must declare to customs foreign currency exceeding the equivalent of CFAF 1 million on entry and exit.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksRegulation 09/98/CM/UEMOA of December 20, 1998; www.bceao.int.

Nonresident AccountsForeign exchange accounts permittedYes.Approval requiredThe holding by nonresidents of accounts denominated in foreign currency other than the euro is subject to prior authorization by the BCEAO. The opening of the account is subject to presentation of documents by nonresidents proving their status and actual residence.Domestic currency accountsBecause the BCEAO has suspended the repurchase of banknotes circulating outside the WAEMU territories, nonresident accounts may not be credited or debited with BCEAObanknotes. These accounts may not be overdrawn without prior authorization by the MOF. Transfers of funds between nonresident accounts are not restricted.
Convertible into foreign currencyConvertible foreign currency accounts may be debited freely for the purchase by nonresidents of foreign currencies on the official exchange market.Blocked accountsNo.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksRegulation 09/98/CM/UEMOA of December 20, 1998; www.bceao.int.

Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Honduras is the Honduran lempira.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Conventional pegged arrangementThe exchange rate of the lempira is determined in foreign exchange auctions. Banks and exchange houses are required to sell all of their daily foreign exchange purchases to the Central Bank of Honduras (CBH). When purchasing foreign exchange, participants in auctions (banks, exchange houses, and private individuals) bid at a price that may not differ from the base price set by the CBH by more than ±7%. The base exchange rate is adjusted every five auctions by the CBH in accordance with the inflation differential between Honduras and its main trading partners, the exchange rates of its main trading partners’ currencies vis-à-vis the dollar, and the level of the CBH’s net international reserves. The amount of foreign exchange offered at each auction must be at least 60% of the CBH’s purchase of foreign exchange from its agents. The minimum amount of foreign exchange to be offered and the base price are announced before the auction. The maximum daily amounts that may be acquired at auction are the equivalent of $300,000 for individuals and $600,000 for legal entities. Foreign exchange agents may make purchases for their own accounts to meet private demands of less than the equivalent of $10,000; the maximum amount of foreign exchange that may be purchased by commercial banks for this purpose is $300,000, savings and loan associations may purchase up to $100,000 daily, and exchange bureaus may purchase up to $30,000. Foreign exchange agents may charge up to 0.7% commission on sales to the public.
Because the authorities maintain a policy of satisfying every admissible bid within the band, the exchange rate is effectively pegged at the most appreciated side of the band.Exchange taxNo.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketNo.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.Arrangements for Payments and Receipts

The tariff rate on goods produced in the CACM area is zero. There are industrial and agricultural processing zones that benefit from tariff exemptions.
The tourism industry also benefits from temporary tariff exemptions. As a provision of the CAFTA-DR agreement signed April 1, 2006, duties on most tariff lines corresponding to industrial and consumer goods will be removed once this agreement enters into force. Duties on other goods will be phased out over periods of up to 10 years.

Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Hong Kong SAR is the Hong Kong dollar.Other legal tenderCommemorative gold coins of HK$1,000 are legal tender, but are kept mostly by collectors and seldom circulate.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Currency board arrangementThe currency board system in Hong Kong SAR, adopted on October 17, 1983, requires the monetary base to be backed by the reserve currency (i.e., the U.S. dollar) around an exchange rate of HK$7.85 per US$1. A symmetric convertibility zone of HK$7.75 to HK$7.85— within which the Hong Kong SAR Monetary Authority (HKMA) may choose to conduct market operations consistent with currency board principles—was introduced May 18, 2005.
The monetary base includes the notes and coins issued, the balance of clearing accounts of banks held with the HKMA (i.e., the aggregate balance), and the outstanding amount of exchange fund bills and notes. Operating under the rule-based currency board system, the HKMA has undertaken to issue additional exchange fund paper only when there is an inflow of funds, but the size of the program is allowed to expand along with the interest payments on such paper.
The issue and redemption of certificates of indebtedness, which provide backing for banknotes issued by the note-issuing banks, are required to be made against U.S. dollars at the fixed exchange rate of HK$7.80 per US$1. The issue and withdrawal of coins and government-issued notes are settled against the U.S. dollar at the same fixed rate.Exchange taxNo.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketThe forward exchange markets operate on private sector initiatives, and the government has no official role.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksArticle 111 of the Basic Law; www.info.gov.hk/basic_law/fulltext/index.htm; Exchange of Letters between the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority to Specify the Monetary Policy Objective and the Structure of the Monetary System of Hong Kong under the

Provisions specific to commercial banks and other credit institutionsThe limits and restrictions stated below are set by the HKMA for prudential reasons only.Maintenance of accounts abroadThe HKMA may prohibit authorized institutions from maintaining accounts (including for the purpose of granting loans and credits) with foreign banks if transactions conducted through these accounts are not made in the interest of the depositors of these institutions.Lending to nonresidents (financial or commercial credits)Authorized institutions incorporated in Hong Kong SAR are permitted to extend loans and credit facilities to one person or company only up to 25% of their respective capital base.Lending locally in foreign exchangeAuthorized institutions incorporated in Hong Kong SAR are permitted to extend loans and credit facilities to one person or company only up to 25% of their respective capital base.Purchase of locally issued securities denominated in foreign exchangeAuthorized institutions incorporated in Hong Kong SAR are permitted to hold the securities of one person or company only up to 25% of their capital base.Investment regulationsNo distinction is made between local and overseas investments.Abroad by banksAuthorized institutions incorporated in Hong Kong SAR may not acquire shares worth more than 5% of the capital base of the institution at the time of acquisition without the approval of the HKMA. In addition, they may not acquire shares in aggregate worth more than 25% of the capital base of the institution. This restriction does not apply if the share capital (1) is held as security for facilities granted; (2) was acquired through an underwriting or subunderwriting contract for a period not to exceed seven days; or (3) was acquired through satisfaction of debts, in which case the share capital must be disposed of at the earliest suitable opportunity, but not later than 18 months after its acquisition.No authorized institution incorporated in Hong Kong SAR may purchase or hold any interest in foreign or domestic land of an aggregate value in excess of 25% of the capital base of the institution. This restriction does not apply to (1) land that is necessary for conducting the In banks by nonresidents

business of the institution or providing housing or amenities for its staff, subject to HKMA approval; (2) interest in land that was mortgaged to the institution to secure a debt due to the institution; and (3) interest in land that accrues after the institution has come into possession of the land, provided the interest is disposed of at the earliest suitable opportunity, but not later than 18 months after acquisition.
The aggregate holdings of share capital and interests in land (including land that is necessary for conducting business or providing housing or amenities for staff), together with the aggregate unsecured facilities to directors (or related parties) of an authorized institution incorporated in Hong Kong SAR, may not at any time exceed 80% of the institution’s capital base.
No person may become a majority shareholder controller, a minority shareholder controller,

or an indirect controller of an authorized institution incorporated in Hong Kong SAR without HKMA approval. Any person who becomes such a controller must notify the HKMA within 14 days.
Open foreign exchange position limits
Provisions specific to institutional investors
Insurance companiesAll authorized institutions must set internal limits on their open position in each foreign currency and their aggregate open position for all foreign currencies. No regulatory foreign exchange position limits are set out by the HKMA. However, locally incorporated authorized institutions are required to provide justification to the HKMA if their aggregate open foreign exchange position limits are higher than 25% of their capital base. Regarding the foreign banks’ branches in Hong Kong SAR, the foreign exchange limits of such branches are monitored by their head offices and home supervisory authorities. However, a foreign bank’s branches in Hong Kong SAR may be required to demonstrate the effectiveness of its risk management systems if its aggregate open foreign exchange position limit is higher than 5% of the bank’s capital base. All authorized institutions are required to report their foreign exchange positions to the HKMA on a monthly basis.Limits (min.) on investment portfolio held locallyThere is no minimum limit on the amount that insurers may hold in investments in locally issued securities. However, insurers carrying on general (or non-life) insurance business locally, other than as professional reinsurers or captive insurers, are required to maintain assets in Hong Kong SAR to match their liabilities from such insurance business. The eligible assets are not limited to local securities and may be in the form of cash, bank deposits, or landed properties.Currency-matching regulations on assets/liabilities compositionAn insurer whose long-term (or life) business liabilities in any particular currency are not (fully) matched by assets in that currency must set up a prudent provision for such currency mismatch.Pension fundsFor the Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) schemes, at least 30% of a constituent fund must be held in Hong Kong dollar–denominated currency investments, as measured by effective currency exposure.Currency-matching regulations on assets/liabilities compositionYes.

(Country Report No. 07/63)In accordance with IMF Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51)Yes.Other security restrictionsYes.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.
Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of India is the Indian rupee.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rateThe exchange rate of the rupee is determined in the interbank market. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which intervenes periodically in the interbank market, purchases and sells spot and forward U.S. dollars to and from ADs in the interbank market at the market exchange rate.Exchange taxNo.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketADs are allowed to deal forward in any permitted currency. The RBI may enter into swap transactions with ADs, under which it buys or sells spot U.S. dollars and sells or buys forward dollars for maturities available in the market.A resident may enter into forward contracts with ADs to hedge against exchange risks. Outstanding forward contracts of importers and exporters booked on the basis of past performance must not exceed at any point in time 100% of the eligible limit, provided any amount in excess of 50%, effective December 13, 2006, (previously, 25%) of the eligible limit must be deliverable. The eligible limit is defined as the past three years’ average of import or export turnover or the previous year’s turnover, whichever is higher. A resident with an underlying contract may enter into a forward contract with an AD in India to hedge exposure to exchange risk to the full extent of such a contract.
ADs may provide forward exchange cover to foreign institutional investors (FIIs) up to the full extent of their investments in debt instruments and equities. FIIs may hedge the entire market value of their investments in equities. ADs may enter into forward contracts with residents outside India to hedge their investments made in India after January 1, 1993, subject to verification of exposure in India. ADs may also provide forward cover not exceeding six months to foreign direct investors to hedge their currency risk arising from proposed direct investments in India after ensuring that the foreign entity involved has completed all formalities and obtained the necessary approvals (where applicable) for the investment in India.
Nonresident Indians (NRIs) may enter into forward contracts with ADs to hedge the amount of dividends due to them or the balances held in their foreign currency nonresident (FCNR) accounts or nonresident external (NRE) accounts. They are also eligible to have forward cover with respect to their investments in portfolio investment schemes.
ADs may offer plain vanilla European forward options to customers who have genuine foreign currency exposures. All conditions applicable for booking, rolling over, and canceling forward contracts are applicable to options contracts. Only one hedge transaction can be booked against a particular exposure or part thereof for a given time period. Options contracts may not be used to hedge contingent or derived exposures, with the exception of exposures arising from the submission of tender bids in foreign exchange.
Residents with overseas direct investments in equities and loans may hedge against exchange risks arising from such investments. Effective December 13, 2006, ADs are allowed to provide forward cover to hedge the economic exposure of importers in the customs duty payable on imports. Effective February 8, 2007, ADs may allow FIIs to cancel and rebook forward contracts up to 2% of the market value of their entire investment in equity and/or debt in India. The limit for calculating the eligibility for rebookings is based on market value of the portfolio at the beginning of the financial year. Outstanding contracts must be supported by underlying exposure at all times. ADs have to ensure that (1) total forward contracts outstanding do not exceed the market value of portfolio and (2) forward contracts permitted to be rebooked do not exceed 2% of the market value as determined at the beginning of the financial year.
Official cover of forward operationsThe Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India, Ltd. (ECGCI) provides protection against exchange fluctuation for deferred receivables from the date of a bid up to 15 years after the award of a contract. Exchange cover is offered in Australian dollars, euros, yen, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, U.A.E. dirhams, and U.S. dollars. For payments specified in other convertible currencies, cover is provided at the discretion of the ECGCI.References to legal instruments andn.a.hyperlinks
Arrangements for Payments and Receipts
Prescription of currency	For prescription of currency purposes, countries are divided into two groups: (1) member requirements	countries of the ACU (except Bhutan and Nepal) and (2) the external group (all other
countries). For the first group, all payments for eligible current international transactions, except payments relating to travel, must be settled through the ACU arrangement. In other cases, payments may be settled in any permitted currency. Export-import transactions financed with loans from international financial institutions are settled outside the ACU mechanism. Trade settlements are made through ACU dollar accounts, which are replenished through the RBI. Payments to countries in the second group may be made in rupees to the account of a resident of any of these countries or in any permitted currency, and receipts from these countries may be obtained in rupees from accounts of a bank situated in any of these countries or in any permitted currency. However, special rules may apply to exports under lines of credit extended by the government of India to the governments of certain foreign countries.
Controls on the use of domestic	n.a. currency
Use of foreign exchange among	Yes. residents
Payments arrangements
Regional arrangements	India is a member of the ACU.
Clearing agreements Although Bhutan and Nepal are members of the ACU, trade with Bhutan and Nepal is settled outside the ACU mechanism. Subject to permission from the Nepal Rastra Bank, Nepalese
residents may import from India against payment in freely convertible currency, in addition to the existing system of payment in Indian rupees; such payments must be effected through the ACU mechanism. Transactions with all other ACU member countries are settled through ACU dollar accounts.
Administration of controlExchange management is administered by the RBI in accordance with the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) of 1999 and the general policy established by the government, in consultation with the RBI. Much of the routine work of exchange control is delegated to ADs. Import and export licenses, where necessary, are issued by the director general of foreign trade.Payments arrears
Controls on trade in gold (coins and/or bullion)No.On domestic ownership and/or tradeThere are no restrictions on internal trade in gold. However, gold mines continue to sell gold to industrial users through the distribution network of the State Bank of India, as well as through market sales. In addition to four agencies authorized by the government, 18 banks are authorized by the RBI to import gold for sale in the domestic market.On external trade
Controls on exports and imports of banknotes
On exportsThere are no restrictions on the export of gold from India. A few designated agencies, banks approved by the RBI, 100% export-oriented units, and units in special economic zones that are in the gem and jewelry business are permitted to directly import gold. NRIs entering India are also permitted to bring in gold bars and coins in accordance with applicable rules. Other guidelines regarding the export and import of gold are governed by the Foreign Trade Policy of the government of India.Domestic currencyIn general, the export of rupee notes and coins, except to Bhutan and Nepal, is prohibited. Exports of rupee notes to Bhutan or Nepal in denominations higher than Rs 100 are also prohibited. However, residents going abroad on a temporary visit may take with them Indian currency notes not exceeding Rs 5,000 a person to countries other than Bhutan and Nepal.Foreign currency
On importsAn authorized person may transfer abroad foreign currency acquired in the normal course of business. Any person may take out foreign exchange obtained from an authorized person and any unspent foreign currency owned or brought in during a previous visit for permissible transactions. Nonresidents may take out unspent foreign exchange up to the aggregate value of foreign exchange declared on the customs declaration form at the time of arrival.Domestic currencyThe importation of rupee notes and coins is prohibited. However, a person may bring in rupee notes (other than notes of denominations larger than Rs 100) from Bhutan and Nepal. Individuals returning from a visit from places other than Bhutan and Nepal may bring in up to Rs 5,000 a person if they took out this amount on their departure from India.Foreign currencyForeign exchange may be brought in without limit, provided the total amount is declared to the customs authorities on arrival if the value of foreign notes, coins, and traveler’s checks exceeds US$10,000 or its equivalent and/or if the aggregate value of foreign currency notes brought in at any one time exceeds US$5,000 or its equivalent.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.
Resident AccountsForeign exchange accounts permittedApproval of the RBI is required for the opening of foreign currency accounts, held either domestically or abroad, except for those covered by general permission granted by the RBI. Effective November 11, 2006, exchange earners may open exchange earners’ foreign currency (EEFC) accounts and credit these accounts with up to 100% of their foreign exchange earnings. These accounts are to be held only as non-interest-bearing accounts, andno credit facility, be it funded or nonfunded, may be made available against the balances.

Commercial creditsAll corporations registered under the Companies Act, except financial intermediaries such as banks, nonbank financial companies, housing finance companies, and other financial institutions, are eligible to raise funds through commercial borrowing from overseas lenders, subject to certain RBI guidelines.By residents to nonresidentsA commercial credit of up to six months is allowed for exports on documents-againstacceptance terms. Contracts for exports involving payments to be realized beyond the normal period of six months, or one year as the case may be, are treated as deferred payment exports. Such exports are permitted, depending on the credit terms offered, the commodity to be exported, and other related considerations. This applies for turnkey, construction, and service contracts undertaken by Indian exporters on credit terms. Under the Buyer’s Credit Scheme, the EXIM Bank offers credits to foreign buyers in connection with the export of capital goods and turnkey projects in India in participation with commercial banks in India. An Indian exporter may lend without restriction from the funds held in an EEFC accountfor trade-related purposes to an overseas importing customer against a bank guarantee. Other transactions require prior permission from the RBI.
To residents from nonresidents
Financial creditsTrade credits up to one year for noncapital goods and less than three years for capital goods are available up to US$20 million for an import transaction; ADs are permitted to guarantee such trade credits.

All corporations registered under the Companies Act (except banks, financial institutions, housing finance companies,
and nonbank financial companies) may borrow abroad up to the equivalent of US$20 million for loans of a minimum three years’ average maturity and up to
US$500 million for loans of more than five years’ average maturity under the automatic route without RBI approval. Borrowing with an average maturity of three to five years is subject to a maximum spread of 200 basis points over the six-month LIBOR of the currency in which the loans are raised or the applicable benchmark(s), and borrowing with more than five years’ average maturity is subject to a maximum spread of 350 basis points.By residents to nonresidentsADs are allowed to give performance bonds or guarantees in favor of overseas buyers for bona fide exports from India, as well as guarantees in the ordinary course of business for missing documents or authenticity of signatures and for other similar purposes. The RBI has granted general permission to agents of foreign shipping and airline companies to give guarantees on behalf of their companies for any debt or other obligation—such as income tax, customs, or postage—to any central or state government agency in India.
Banks are not permitted to issue a guarantee, standby LC, or letter of comfort of undertaking on behalf of their constituents in favor of an overseas lender to access external commercial borrowings or financial credit.

NRIs may use funds derived from fresh remittances or held in their NRE or FCNR accounts to (1) make portfolio investments with repatriation benefits of up to 5% of the capital, provided their total holdings of shares and convertible debentures held under the Package Scheme of Incentives do not exceed 10% (extendable to 24% if the general meeting of the investing company passes a special resolution) of the paid-up capital of the company or of the total paid-in value of each series of convertible debentures issued by the company; (2) invest freely in national savings certificates with full repatriation benefits.

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN
(Position as of December 31, 2006)
Status under IMF Articles of Agreement
Article VIIIDate of acceptance: September 6, 2004.
Exchange MeasuresRestrictions and/or multiple currency practices
International security restrictionsThe staff report for the 2005 Article IV consultation with the Islamic Republic of Iran states that as of March 8, 2006, the Islamic Republic of Iran maintained one exchange restriction and two multiple currency practices subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3. The exchange restriction arises from limitations set out in the by-laws adopted to implement the Foreign Investment and Promotion Act on the transferability of (periodic) rial profits from certain foreign direct investments. The multiple currency practices arise from: budget subsidies for foreign exchange purchases in connection with payments of certain letters of credit opened prior to March 21, 2002, under the previous multiple exchange rate system; and obligation of entities that had received allocation of foreign exchange for payments based on subsidized “allocated rates” under the previous multiple exchange rate system to surrender unused allocations to the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) at the allocation rate. (Country Report No. 06/154)In accordance with IMF Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51)All banking, finance, and credit institutions have been instructed to freeze suspected accounts, based on an official list. These measures were taken in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions.Other security restrictionsYes.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.

Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Iraq is the Iraqi dinar.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Crawling pegUnder a policy of pursuing exchange rate stability, the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) limited the fluctuations of the dinar to within ±1%, until October 2006. Since then the CBI has changed its monetary stance and allowed the exchange rate to gradually appreciate following a predetermined path. As a result, the exchange arrangement of Iraq has been reclassified, effective November 1, 2006, to the category crawling peg from the category conventional pegged arrangement.
Within these limits, the exchange rate of the dinar is determined in the foreign exchange market. Auctions are held daily, and eligible bidders may buy and sell foreign exchange at freely determined rates. All final transactions are allocated at a single settlement price. Brokerage companies buying and selling foreign currencies are authorized to charge commissions in Iraqi dinars not exceeding 0.25% for purchases and 0.5% for sales.
Exchange bureaus of private banks are permitted to participate at the daily auction but must remain within the bureau’s capital ceiling. The amounts of letters of guarantee issued to the CBI by brokerage companies to ensure against the misuse of foreign exchange transfers, and to ensure good performance by brokerage firms in buying and selling foreign currencies authorized by the CBI and compliance with relevant instructions, are up to 20% of a company’s capital.Exchange taxNo.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketNo.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.Arrangements for Payments and Receipts

Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Italy is the euro.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Independently floatingItaly participates in a currency union with 12 other members of the EMU and has no separate legal tender. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the EMU countries has been reclassified to the category independently floating from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members.Exchange taxNo.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketPremiums and discounts in the forward exchange market are left to the interplay of market forces.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.Arrangements for Payments and Receipts

There is no automatic mechanism through which outstanding balances are settled within 90 days. Only Italy is allowed to maintain a debit balance on these accounts.Administration of controlResidents are allowed to conduct foreign exchange transactions freely, with settlements to be effected either indirectly—through the Bank of Italy, other financial intermediaries, or the Poste Italiane S.p.a.—or directly by drawing on external accounts or by offsetting debts and credits vis-à-vis other residents or nonresidents.

Exchange MeasuresRestrictions and/or multiple currency practices
International security restrictionsNo restrictions as reported in the latest staff report as of December 31, 2006.Other security restrictionsRepayment of the loan from Iraq has been suspended in line with UN sanctions.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.
Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Jamaica is the Jamaican dollar.Other legal tenderCommemorative gold coins in denominations of J$100 and J$500 and souvenir coins in denominations of J$5, J$10, J$25, J$50, and J$100 are legal tender but do not circulate.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rateThe exchange rate of the Jamaican dollar is determined in the domestic foreign exchange market. This market is operated by ADs, cambios, bureaux de change, and the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ). The ADs include all commercial banks, selected merchant banks, and the three largest building societies. ADs engage in (1) the purchasing and selling of foreign currency in the form of cash, drafts, traveler’s checks, and other instruments; (2) the granting of loans and the taking of deposits; and (3) the making of other international payments. Cambios are allowed to purchase and sell unlimited amounts of foreign exchange in any form to any person. Their main function is the exchange of currency for hotel guests. However, unlike ADs, cambios are not permitted to grant loans or accept deposits. Excess foreign exchange may be sold without restriction to commercial banks, other ADs, and the general public.
Proceeds from official loans, divestment of government assets, and taxes on the bauxite sector payable in foreign currency are sold directly to the BOJ. The BOJ purchases foreign exchange from ADs and cambios under the following terms: (1) purchases are made in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, pounds sterling, and euros; (2) the minimum amount that the BOJ will purchase in a single transaction is 50,000 units of the foreign currency; and (3) the exchange rates for these currencies are negotiated by the BOJ.Exchange taxNo.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketThis market is currently inactive.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.Arrangements for Payments and Receipts
Prescription of currency Although there is no restriction on transactions in any currency, the principal foreign requirements currencies accepted in the exchange market are the Canadian dollar, the pound sterling, and the U.S. dollar. Surrender may be made in any of these three major currencies. Surrender in Canadian dollars and pounds sterling may be made in U.S. dollars and must be covered at the cross-currency rate derived from their respective weighted-average buying rates in the local market on the day of purchase. Payments to all countries may be made by crediting Jamaican dollars to an external account or a foreign currency account. Receipts from all countries must be debited to an external account in any foreign currency.
Controls on the use of domestic currency
Payments arrangementsEconomic agents are free to settle all transactions with domestic currency. The Jamaican dollar may be used to conduct and settle all current and capital transactions.Regional arrangementsJamaica is a member of CARICOM.Clearing agreementsThe clearing arrangements within the framework of CARICOM have been suspended since November 1, 1990. The BOJ no longer intervenes in CARICOM private sector commercial transactions; settlements for such transactions are effected by the commercial banking sector in convertible currencies.Administration of control
Payments arrearsTrading in foreign exchange, other than by and through an AD, is prohibited.

Balances in these accounts may be converted into foreign currency at the prevailing exchange rate. Interest on these accounts is exempt from tax, provided deposits are held as certificates of deposit with at least a one-year maturity. New B accounts have not been permitted since September 22, 1991.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.
Nonresident AccountsForeign exchange accounts permittedNonresidents may hold foreign exchange accounts (A accounts) in Jamaica.

Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Kazakhstan is the Kazakhstani tenge.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rateThe exchange rate of the tenge is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The foreign exchange market includes the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange (KASE), which conducts daily trading online using an electronic trading system, an over-the-counter interbank market, and a network of more than 3,000 exchange bureaus handling foreign exchange cash transactions. Banks may participate in trading sessions on their own account or on behalf of their clients. Banks may also trade in an over-the-counter interbank market at freely negotiated rates.
The official exchange rate of the tenge against the dollar is determined daily on the basis of the weighted average rate at 11:00 a.m. the previous day on the KASE. The rates for other currencies are calculated on the basis of their cross rates against the dollar. The NBK publishes daily exchange rates of certain currencies against the tenge for accounting and customs payments computation purposes. Commercial banks set their own exchange rates without restrictions.Exchange taxNo.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketForeign exchange futures are quoted on the KASE.

An NBK license was also required if the import contract specified a delivery date of less than 180 days, but the actual date on which the nonresident fulfilled the obligation to deliver goods or return funds exceeded 180 days.Documentation requirements for release of foreign exchange for importsEffective January 1, 2007, presentation of an import contract or other supporting documents is required for effecting import payments.Domiciliation requirementResident juridical persons are required to submit relevant import contracts to an authorized bank when purchasing foreign exchange for import payments.OtherEffective January 1, 2007, a transaction passport must be completed for accounting purposes only for each import transaction valued in excess of the equivalent of $10,000 with the servicing bank.

Registration with the NBK was required for early delivery by a nonresident of imports valued in excess of $300,000 more than 180 days before the payment date. Registration requirements did not apply to import contracts when transaction passports had been completed for the entire amount of the contract.
Also, effective January 1, 2007, deferral of payment on imports or advance payment on imports is considered a commercial credit. A resident importer must register a commercial credit with the NBK in specified cases.Import licenses and other nontariff measuresThere is a licensing regime for imports of alcoholic products, explosives, products for military use, weapons, poisonous substances, industrial wastes, nuclear materials (equipment), and special equipment for police investigation uses.Negative listImports of all types of military-style weapons and ammunition; weapons of mass destruction, as well as materials and equipment that could be used in the production of weapons of mass destruction; narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and their precursors, as well as paraphernalia for their use; printed and graphic materials aimed at the overthrow of the state system and social order that contain propaganda promoting war, terrorism, violence, or racism, as well as materials with pornographic content; and ozone-depleting substances, as well as products that contain ozone-depleting substances, are prohibited.Import taxes and/or tariffsImports are subject to (1) VAT and customs duties (certain goods are exempt); (2) excise taxes (where applicable); and (3) antidumping, protection, and compensation duties (if such duties exist).

Exports and Export ProceedsRepatriation requirementsEffective January 1, 2007, residents must ensure that domestic and foreign currency received by them in payment for export goods (work, services) is credited to bank accounts with authorized banks within the time period stipulated by the terms of the transaction. Previously, all proceeds from exports of goods (work, services) had to be received by residents and credited to accounts at authorized banks within 180 days of the date of export of the goods (work, services).
An NBK license was previously required to credit export proceeds in foreign exchange to accounts at authorized banks or to fulfill obligations in some other manner more than 180 days from the export date. An NBK license established repatriation deadlines substantiated by the resident.
In order to credit export proceeds to a resident’s account at a foreign bank, the resident must have had an NBK license to open the given account at a foreign bank or a certificate of registration with the NBK, or the resident must have notified the NBK of the existence of such an account.
The crediting of export proceeds by a resident to bank accounts at authorized banks is not required in the following cases: (1) the foreign exchange proceeds are credited to the resident’s accounts at foreign banks if these accounts are intended to provide security for the resident’s obligations under the terms of a loan solicited from a nonresident; and (2) the foreign exchange proceeds are credited to accounts at foreign banks if these accounts are intended to support the activities of branches and representative offices of the resident that have been opened abroad. In the event that export proceeds in foreign exchange are not credited to accounts at authorized banks, the repatriation requirement is considered to have been met in full or in part if (1) a nonresident’s obligation is offset by a counterclaim of the same nature; (2) a nonresident’s obligation is met by replacing the original obligation between the parties with a different obligation between the same parties that provided for a different object or means of fulfillment; (3) the right of claim on a nonresident is assigned to another party; and (4) an insurance payment is received, if an insured event occurs under insurance agreements covering the risk of default by a nonresident.Financing requirementsNo.Documentation requirementsEffective January 1, 2007, the export contract must be presented only to the bank servicing the transaction (previously, to the customs authorities also). Effective January 1, 2007, a transaction passport must be completed for accounting purposes for export transactions involving the movement of goods valued in excess of the equivalent of $10,000 only for the bank servicing the transaction (previously, to the customs authorities). Previously, the transaction passport was checked to verify compliance with the terms of the export contract and was monitored by the customs office and the bank until completion of the transaction. Effective January 1, 2007, deferral of payment on exports or advance payment on exports is considered a commercial credit. A resident exporter must register a commercial credit forexports with the NBK in the following instances: (1) if a resident made early delivery on exports valued in excess of the equivalent of $50,000 more than 180 days before the payment date, effective January 1, 2007; and (2) if a nonresident makes prepayment on exports valued in excess of the equivalent of $300,000 more than 180 days before the delivery date. Registration requirements do not apply to export contracts where transaction passports are required. Previously, advance delivery of exports for a period of up to 180 days was allowed without restriction. Deferral of payment for exports beyond 180 days was considered a capital transaction and required an NBK license if the amount of the export delivery exceeded $10,000. An NBK license was also required in the event that the export contract specified a delivery date of less than 180 days, but the actual date on which the nonresident fulfilled the obligations to pay for goods or return delivered goods exceeded 180 days.

The WTO valuation principle is also applied. The ad valorem rates vary between zero and 70%. There are preferential duty rates for goods imported for industrial, agricultural, or public use. In addition to ad valorem duties, which apply to about 93% of products, the following other methods are used: (1) the bracket-based calculation in the case of cars, in which the value of a car is divided into two brackets and the total duty is the sum of the duties applied at each rate; (2) duties calculated on the basis of units of measure, such as weight or volume (e.g., gasoline); and (3) a combined duty calculated on an ad valorem and specific basis, so that the higher amount is collected (e.g., tropical fruits and chickens). In addition, excise duties are collected on alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, cars, cement, and fuels.
Lebanon applies the Arab Free Trade Area Convention and has bilateral free trade agreements with Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the Syrian Arab Republic, and the United Arab Emirates.

(Position as of January 31, 2007)
Status under IMF Articles of Agreement
Article VIIIDate of acceptance: June 19, 1998.
Exchange MeasuresRestrictions and/or multiple currency practicesThe staff report for the 2006 Article IV consultation with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia states that as of July 14, 2006, FYR Macedonia maintained an exchange restriction subject to the Fund’s approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a), arising from restrictions imposed on the transferability of proceeds from current international transactions contained in the former frozen foreign currency savings deposits. (Country Report No. 06/344)International security restrictionsNo.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.
Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is the Macedonian denar.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Conventional pegged arrangementThe exchange market operates at two levels: wholesale (enterprises, commercial banks, and the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (NBRM)) and retail (foreign exchange bureaus and natural persons). The NBRM participates in the wholesale market to maintain the value of the denar against the euro. Buying and selling rates for transactions between authorized banks and enterprises have to be reported to the NBRM. Based on the reported transactions between authorized banks, and on transactions between the NBRM and authorized banks, the NBRM calculates the selling rate of the euro against the denar as a weighted average of the realized turnover. Based on this rate and the ECB euro foreign exchange reference fixing, the NBRM determines rates for 12 currencies and deals at the buying and selling rates (i.e., midpoint rates plus or minus a margin of 0.5%).
Foreign exchange bureaus owned and operated by savings institutions, trade companies, sole proprietors, and other legal entities may hold foreign exchange in cash up to the specified maximum level, and must keep the balances above this level in a special account with the commercial banks of their preference. Foreign exchange offices owned by banks are excluded from previous provision.Exchange taxNo.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketForward foreign exchange operations are allowed for all residents.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.Arrangements for Payments and Receipts

Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Malaysia is the Malaysian ringgit.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rateThe Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) operates a de jure managed float for the ringgit with reference to a currency basket. The composition of the basket is not disclosed. Based on information on the exchange rate behavior, the de facto exchange rate regime of Malaysia has been reclassified, effective January 1, 2006, to the category managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate from the category conventional pegged arrangement.Exchange taxn.a.Exchange subsidyn.a.Forward exchange marketAll forward exchange contracts undertaken by residents and forward exchange contracts by nonresidents involving ringgit must be made only with licensed onshore banks. Residents are free to enter into forward exchange contracts against ringgit or a foreign currency with licensed onshore banks for the following purposes: (1) hedging for any payments or receipts for current account transactions. The contracts may be based on a firm commitment or on an anticipatory basis. For forward contracts entered into on an anticipatory basis, the total outstanding value of the contracts should not exceed the total amount paid or received in the preceding 12 months; (2) effective April 1, 2007, hedging for any committed capital inflows or outflows such as drawdown or repayment of permitted foreign currency credit facilities and payment for permitted investment in foreign currency assets. Previously, hedging of foreign currency loan repayments was allowed only for commitments of up to 24 months; and (3) hedging the value of permitted foreign currency investments.
Nonresidents may enter into forward contracts to buy or sell foreign currency against ringgit with licensed onshore banks to hedge (1) committed payments or receipts for current account transactions, which are permitted to be settled in ringgit with residents, and (2) committed inflows and outflows for investments in, or divestments of, ringgit assets other than (a) funds in the external account, including fixed deposits; (b) negotiable instruments of deposits in ringgit; and (c) over-the-counter derivatives or structured products, which are tantamount to lending or borrowing of ringgit between residents and nonresidents. Effective April 1,2007, licensed onshore banks may appoint overseas branches of their banking group as a vehicle to facilitate the settlement of any ringgit assets of their nonresident clients. The ringgit transactions undertaken by the overseas branches are subject to the following conditions: (1) the overseas bank must conduct only straight pass-through transactions matched with a back-to-back arrangement on both amount and tenure with the licensed onshore banks. There must not be gapping of the ringgit positions in the books of the overseas branches; (2) the arrangement is available only to nonresident investors with a firm underlying commitment to invest in ringgit assets; and (3) the licensed onshore banks undertake full responsibility to ensure compliance on the conditions by establishing internal control and procedures as well as documentation of the overseas branches’ transactions for audit purposes. Nonresident intermediaries may enter into swap arrangements not exceeding three working days with licensed onshore banks to cover payment for ringgit securities purchased by the nonresident intermediaries’ nonresident clients, with the following conditions: (1) a swap arrangement must be based on a firm commitment and not on an anticipatory basis and (2) the maturity date of the arrangement must be the committed payment date with no rollover option. Multilateral development banks (MDBs) and foreign multinational corporations (MNCs) that are allowed to issue ringgit-denominated bonds may enter into forward contracts to sell foreign currency for ringgit to meet coupon or principal payment of the bonds. In addition, they may purchase forward foreign currency for repatriation of proceeds of the issuance abroad. A resident with a firm underlying commitment may enter into interest rate swaps with licensed onshore banks or licensed offshore banks in Labuan. All payments or receipts involving licensed offshore banks in Labuan must be made in foreign currency. The maturity date of the forward foreign exchange contract must be the expected date of receipt or payment of the underlying transactions. For forward sale of export proceeds, the maturity date of the forward contract should not be later than six months after the intended date of export.

MALI
(Position as of January 31, 2007)
Status under IMF Articles of Agreement
Article VIIIDate of acceptance: June 1, 1996.
Exchange MeasuresRestrictions and/or multiple currency practices
International security restrictionsNo restrictions as reported in the latest staff report as of December 31, 2006.Other security restrictionsA framework has been established at the WAEMU regional level to combat the financing of terrorism in the member states of the union. The framework facilitates the enforcement of the decisions on the freezing of funds made by the Sanctions Committee of the UN
Security Council, based on the list of persons and entities established by that committee.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksRegulation 14/2002/CM/UEMOA by the WAEMU Council of Ministers of September 19, 2002; www.uemoa.int/actes/Default.htm; www.bceao.int.
Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Mali is the CFA franc.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Conventional pegged arrangementMali participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at the rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris foreign exchange market vis-à-vis the euro. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the WAEMU countries has been reclassified to the category conventional pegged arrangement from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change, and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members.Exchange taxA symmetrical bank commission of 0.3% applies to transfers to all countries outside the WAEMU. The proceeds of this commission must be surrendered in their entirety to the treasury. In addition, banks are allowed to charge an exchange commission of up to 2% on over-the-counter exchange for euros.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketResidents are authorized to contract forward exchange cover for payments related to imports and exports of goods and services. Forward cover may be contracted only in the currency of settlement stipulated in the commercial contract. Maturities must correspond to the due date of the import or export payment stipulated in the commercial contract.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.Arrangements for Payments and Receipts
Prescription of currency	Mali is linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account, through which requirements	settlements with France, Monaco, and other Operations Account countries (WAEMU and CAEMC member countries and the Comoros) are made in euros or in the currency of any other Operations Account country. Settlements outside the Operations Account may be conducted freely in CFA francs.
Controls on the use of domestic currency
For capital transactionsTransactions in derivatives and other instrumentsYes.Use of foreign exchange among residents
Payments arrangementsThe CFA franc is the only legal tender, and residents are not permitted to use foreign exchange for domestic transactions.Regional arrangementsAn Operations Account is maintained with the French Treasury that links Operations Account countries. All purchases or sales of foreign currencies or euros against CFA francs are ultimately settled through a debit or credit to the Operations Account.Clearing agreementsA multilateral clearing agreement exists in the context of the WAMA among the countries of the WAEMU, Cape Verde, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. All payments related to current transactions between the member bank countries may be effected under the clearing arrangements. However, this excludes transactions specified by the committee of governors of the CBs of ECOWAS member countries and payments related to the exportation from the country of a member bank to the country of another member bank of finished products originating in countries whose CB or monetary authority is not a member of the WAMA.Administration of controlExchange control is administered jointly by the MOF and the BCEAO. Most of the authority to supervise foreign exchange transactions is delegated to authorized banks, which are required to report these operations to the MOF. The BCEAO is also authorized to collect— either directly or through banks, financial institutions, the postal administration, or judicial agents—any information necessary to compile balance of payments statistics. Customs officers monitor outflows of foreign exchange and confirm import and export of goods. All residents of WAEMU countries are treated as residents of Mali for the purposes of financial transactions. All foreign exchange operations with foreign countries must be effected through authorized intermediary banks, the postal administration, or the BCEAO. No supporting documents are required for transfers of up to the equivalent of CFAF 300,000. Within the framework of the regional financial market, the placement and soliciting of foreign and domestic securities in Mali require prior authorization by the RCPSFM.Payments arrears
Controls on trade in gold (coins and/or bullion)No.On domestic ownership and/or tradeDomestic trade in gold and other precious materials or fossils is permitted only for persons of Malian nationality or licensed nationals of other countries with which Mali has a reciprocal agreement and who hold professional identity cards. There are no controls on holding gold for noncommercial purposes.On external trade
Controls on exports and imports of banknotes
On exportsImports of gold require prior MOF authorization. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports by or on behalf of the treasury or the BCEAO, (2) imports of manufactured articles containing minor quantities of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles), and (3) imports by travelers of gold objects up to a combined weight of 500 grams. Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Exports of gold have been liberalized.Domestic currencyCFA franc banknotes may be exported freely by travelers. However, the suspension of
BCEAO repurchases of exported banknotes continues. In addition, the exchange of BCEAO banknotes between authorized intermediaries and their correspondents outside the WAEMU is prohibited.
Foreign currency
On importsThe reexportation of foreign banknotes by nonresident travelers is allowed up to the equivalent of CFAF 500,000; the reexportation of foreign banknotes above this ceiling requires documentation demonstrating either the importation of the foreign banknotes or their purchase against other means of payment registered in the name of the traveler or through the use of nonresident deposit accounts in local banks.Foreign currencyResidents and nonresidents may bring in any amount of foreign banknotes and coins (except gold coins) of countries outside the Operations Account area. Residents bringing in foreign banknotes and foreign currency traveler’s checks exceeding the equivalent of CFAF 300,000 must declare them to customs on entry and sell them to an authorized intermediary bank within eight days. Nonresident travelers must declare to customs foreign currency exceeding the equivalent of CFAF 1 million on entry and exit.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksRegulation 09/98/CM/UEMOA of December 20, 1998; www.bceao.int.

However, residents are required to repatriate assets held in these accounts within 30 days of their return. In all other cases, prior authorization by the MOF, after BCEAO approval, is required to open an account abroad.Accounts in domestic currency held abroadNo.Accounts in domestic currency convertible into foreign currencyNo.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksRegulation 09/98/CM/UEMOA of December 20, 1998; www.bceao.int.
Nonresident AccountsForeign exchange accounts permittedYes.Approval requiredThe holding by nonresidents of accounts denominated in foreign currency other than the euro is subject to prior authorization by the BCEAO. The opening of the account is subject to presentation of documents by nonresidents proving their status and actual residence.Domestic currency accountsBecause the BCEAO has suspended the repurchase of banknotes circulating outside the WAEMU area, nonresident accounts may not be credited or debited with BCEAO banknotes. These accounts may not be overdrawn without prior MOF authorization.
Transfers of funds between nonresident accounts are not restricted.Convertible into foreign currencyConvertible foreign currency accounts may be debited freely for the purchase by nonresidents of foreign currencies on the official exchange market.Blocked accountsNo.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksRegulation 09/98/CM/UEMOA of December 20, 1998; www.bceao.int.Imports and Import Payments

Authorization is not required for purchases of foreign securities whose issuance or offering for sale in WAEMU countries has been authorized by the RCPSFM.Sale or issue abroad by residentsResidents may sell local corporate securities abroad. If these operations result in foreign control of domestic establishments, foreign investors are required to make a prior declaration to the MOF. The sale of securities to liquidate an investment abroad is subject to declaration to the MOF for statistical purposes.

Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Mexico is the Mexican peso.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Independently floatingThe exchange rate of the peso is determined freely in the foreign exchange market. The Exchange Commission established a rules-based mechanism to reduce the rate of international reserves accumulation. The Bank of Mexico (BOM) sells dollars directly in the foreign exchange market every day according to the following procedure: the BOM announces every quarter the total amount of dollars it will offer to the currency market each day during the following four quarters. The total amount of dollars to be sold will equal 50% of the net international reserves accumulated during the previous quarter, with one-fourth of the established amount being auctioned each quarter, not including the cumulative amount of dollars sold through the auction mechanism during the same period. Based on the total amount of dollars, the BOM auctions on a daily basis a fixed amount of dollars following a preestablished schedule (the daily amount to be sold is determined according to the number of working days in the current quarter).Exchange taxNo.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketOnly commercial and development banks are allowed to enter into exchange rate, stock exchange, and other derivative transactions. Authorization from the BOM is required, which is granted on the basis of certain organizational, legal, and risk management requirements.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksCircular-Fax 18/2003, 18/2003 BIS, and 18/2003 BIS I on U.S. Dollar Auctions, www.banxico.org.mx/tipo/disposiciones/bancos/cir18-2003-compilado.htm; Nos.

Imports and Import PaymentsForeign exchange budgetNo.Financing requirements for importsNo.Documentation requirements for release of foreign exchange for importsNo.Import licenses and other nontariff measuresImport licenses issued by the Ministry of Economy (MOE) are required for 180 of the 11,954 items on which Mexico’s general import tariff is levied, including the 26 tariff lines related to “special operations,” under which manufacturing industries may import (with zero duties but under a license) finished goods that allow them to complement their offer and fulfill the program of manufacture in which they have registered; temporary imports of raw materials and intermediate inputs for exporting industries do not need a license. New licenses are issued, provided the criteria set by the MOE are satisfied. On average, import licenses are valid for a period of one year, but for some sensitive products, they are valid only for six months. For some products, open-ended import licenses may be granted, allowing imports to be effected during a period of six months to one year, subject to an overall limit. Depending on the importer’s performance, the license may be renewed repeatedly. No import license is required for funeral cars and coaches, go-karts, and collectors’ vehicles (at least 30 years old). Imports of used cars other than funeral cars and coaches, go-karts, and collectors’ vehicles, are subject to the prior approval of the MOE, but only special-purpose vehicles that are different from those made locally are allowed.Negative listYes.Open general licensesEffective March 13, 2006, imports of gold and silver are allowed under OGLs.Licenses with quotasYes.Other nontariff measuresImports of used agricultural machinery, raw materials, and intermediate products require agricultural certificates, inspection, and lab analysis. Goods covered by CITES are prohibited. Other nontariff regulations, such as those related to national security concerns (firearms and weapons); Health Department standards; ecological and environmental regulations; and restrictions on drugs, narcotic substances, nuclear energy, and toxic and hazardous materials, apply to about 1,680 of the 11,954 items of Mexico’s general import tariff. About 3,712 tariff items are subject to qualitative examinations by customs to verify if goods fulfill certain Mexican consumer standards.
Import taxes and/or tariffsImport duties range from zero to 20%, with higher rates for a few products, such as fructose (subject to a 210% tariff) and clothing, footwear, and leather goods (35% tariff), whereas 2,500 tariff items are totally duty-free without restriction on country of origin. A 50% tariff applies to imports of new cars from countries with which no commercial agreement exists. A 7% to 10% duty rate applies on 17 tariff items in the automobile sector. Imports from members of the LAIA are granted preferential duty treatment. Free trade agreements exist with Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the EFTA, El Salvador, the EU, Guatemala, Honduras, Israel, Japan, Nicaragua, and Uruguay. Trade with Canada and the United States takes place under the NAFTA. Mexico has applied antidumping duties to the following products: electrical transformers and steel products from Brazil; textiles and articles of apparel, electronic products, nonelectronic toys, pencils, padlocks, bicycles and bicycle tires, iron and steel valves, and chemical products from China; beef, rice, sodium hydroxide, polyvinyl chloride, fructose, seamless steel tubes, rods and bars, and polystyrene from the United States; seamless steel tubes from Japan; polyester from Korea; steel products from Canada, the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and República Bolivariana de Venezuela; chemical products from Denmark; and frozen beef and polystyrene from EU countries. Tariffs do not apply to imports destined for reexportation, except those under a free trade agreement. The tariff measures are designed to support competitiveness of the industrial plant, to allow imports of strategic inputs, and to reduce production costs. Effective September 5, 2006, the duty rates applicable to aluminum ingots and lysine (a foodstuff input), some chemical substances, inputs for tanning, flats for bike tires, and some handheld tools were reduced. A tariff item for statistical purposes was created for footwear heels and soles, as well as machinery for repairing airships and aircraft parts. Effective September 29, 2006, generalized duty rates for about 6,900 tariff lines related to inputs were reduced to reorder productive chains and standardize the rates applicable to intermediate inputs. Effective November 27, 2006, the duty rates applicable to textile inputs were reduced. A new quota was imposed on textile inputs. A new tariff item was introduced to keep track of wines, brandy, and distilled agave. Tariff classifications were made for steel products. The duty rate applicable to specialized boats used in the processing of crude petroleum was eliminated, and the preferential rates applicable to goods from the European Community, AELC, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Japan were adjusted. Also, the presidential decree that establishes special duty rates for inputs imported under the Sectorial Programs (PROSEC) was updated to support the manufacturing industries that operate these programs.State import monopolyNo.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.

Provisions Specific to the Financial Sector
Provisions specific to commercial banks and other credit institutionsBanks that obtain an unconditional warranty from foreign financial entities may be exempt from the limits on foreign currency liabilities and investments for foreign exchange transactions, provided the long-term debt of the warrantor is rated at least “AA–” by Standard & Poor’s or “Aa3” by Moody’s Investors Service. BOM approval is required for debt rated by other agencies. Banks and limited scope financial institutions must disclose fees and commissions to users of financial services, and the BOM is authorized to determine if there is reasonable competition with respect to the fees of banks and other financial intermediaries. Effective July 18, 2006, the General Law on Credit Organizations and Auxiliary Activities has been amended to overrule all the provisions regarding financial leasing companies and financial factoring companies. Granting of credits, financial leasing, and financial factoring may be provided by any person without prior approval by the federal government. People who engage in the aforesaid activities in a customary and professional manner are considered multiple scope companies, which may be regulated or not regulated. Regulated multiple scope companies are supervised by the CNBV and are those entities that maintain economic links with credit institutions, or holding companies that have a credit institution in their financial group.Borrowing abroadBorrowing abroad is permitted, subject to the limits on the liabilities of commercial banks denominated in foreign currency and on open foreign exchange positions.Maintenance of accounts abroadForeign exchange risk positions, both total and for each foreign currency, must not exceed the daily limit of 15% of a bank’s base capital.Lending to nonresidents (financial or commercial credits)There are limits on the amount banks may lend, regardless of the borrower’s residence.Lending locally in foreign exchangeThere are limits on the amount that banks may lend regardless of the borrower’s nationality or residence, and on their net open foreign exchange position.Purchase of locally issued securities denominated in foreign exchange

If the acquisition exceeds 5% of the shares representingthe capital stock of a banking institution, CNBV opinion is required prior to MOF approval. The limits on shareholders do not apply to foreign offshore banking institutions that were set up in accordance with an international trade treaty.
Open foreign exchange position limitsOn resident assets and liabilitiesIrrespective of the counterparty’s residence, total liabilities of commercial banks denominated in or referred to foreign currency (excluding cash and liquid assets, as determined by the BOM) must not exceed an amount equal to 183% of the capital stock of the respective bank. (Calculation of the base capital stock reflects the capitalization procedure set under the Basel Accord. The conversion of the base capital into national currency takes into account the exchange rate published by the BOM in the Official Gazette of the business day following the date of the calculation of the base capital.) Notwithstanding this requirement, the BOM allows short or long foreign exchange risk positions, which, both jointly and for each foreign currency at the end of each day, do not exceed 15% of the bank’s base capital (base capital being calculated pursuant to rules issued by the MOF). For the calculation of the foreign exchange position, commercial banks must include the foreign currency operations of their agencies and affiliates—in Mexico and abroad—except for securities firms, foreign exchange firms, bonding companies, insurance companies, managing companies of mutual funds, mutual funds, and pension fund management companies.
Commercial banks may be authorized by the BOM to determine the positions referred to above from a long position in dollars.On nonresident assets and liabilities

ClassificationUnitary.Conventional pegged arrangementThe official (reference) exchange rate of the togrog against the dollar is set daily by the Bank of Mongolia (BOM) as the daily average of the buying and selling rates of transactions among participants in the interbank foreign exchange market. The BOM reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market using the dollar as the principal intervention currency. Effective June 1, 2006, reflecting the stability of the togrog exchange rate owing to BOM interventions, the de facto exchange rate arrangement of Mongolia was reclassified to a conventional pegged arrangement from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate.
The official exchange rate is applied to customs valuation and public sector imports and service payments, including debt service, and to trade and service transactions conducted under bilateral payments arrangements. All other transactions, including sales of retained foreign exchange by public sector enterprises, take place through the interbank market. Exchange rates for other convertible currencies are calculated on the basis of the cross rates against the dollar in international markets.Exchange taxNo.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketBanks are granted a supplementary foreign exchange settlement license from the BOM for engaging in forward exchange transactions.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.Arrangements for Payments and Receipts

ClassificationUnitary.Managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rateThe Bank of Mozambique (BM) discloses the average foreign exchange buying and selling rates of commercial banks in the interbank foreign exchange market (MCI) recorded online by banks using software provided by the BM. This rate is used by the BM in its foreign exchange buying and selling transactions in the MCI (including auction sales), based on the best price criterion (highest sale price and lowest purchase price). However, the BM introduced a temporary band in the interbank foreign exchange market that the authorities have committed to eliminate by end-June 2007.
The foreign exchange auctions introduced in 2005 have a spot-value date set by the software provided by the BM. The exchange rate the BM currently publishes daily (D) is an average of the exchange rates quoted by the commercial banks at the BM’s computerized rates window, as determined at 3:30 p.m. the previous day (D – 1).
Commercial banks, which participate in the market, may buy and sell foreign exchange from and to individual customers at freely negotiated rates, and exchange bureaus may do the same. Negotiated transactions between the BM and commercial banks have a spot-value date (up to two business days).
Effective December 18, 2006, a new regulation (Notice No. 5 of December 2006) came into effect stipulating that commercial banks participating in the MCI must subscribe to a code of conduct and must honor up to one firm quotation of $50,000 a day. According to this regulation, the maximum spread between the foreign exchange buying and selling rates is set at the discretion of the BM. There is also an interbank money market and an interdealer market in foreign exchange (commercial banks and exchange bureaus) outside the fixing sessions.Exchange taxNo.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketThe use of this market is not common.References to legal instruments and	Notice No. 1/GGBM/2005; Notice No. 5/GGBM/2006; www.bancomoc.mz. hyperlinks

Exchange MeasuresRestrictions and/or multiple currency practices
International security restrictionsThe staff report for the 2006 Article IV consultation with Myanmar states that as of September 20, 2006, Myanmar maintained exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval under Article VIII. These include (i) limits on the availability of foreign exchange for foreign travel by residents, (ii) limits on remittances of wage income by nonresidents, and (iii) limits on payments and transfers for certain other invisible transactions, and a multiple currency practice resulting from the divergence between the official exchange rate and the parallel market-determined FEC rate.In accordance with IMF Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51)In accordance with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, measures have been taken to freeze the funds and other financial assets of listed individuals and organizations associated with terrorism.Other security restrictionsYes.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.
Exchange ArrangementCurrency
Exchange rate structureThe currency of Myanmar is the Myanmar kyat.Dual
ClassificationIn addition to the official exchange rate, an unofficial rate is determined in an officially tolerated parallel foreign exchange market. FECs are issued by the Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM) in denominations of 1, 5, 10, and 20 units and are exchangeable for euros, yen, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars or for authorized traveler’s checks at the rate of FEC 1 per US$1. FECs are widely used and serve the needs of visitors and investors in Myanmar. FECs may be exchanged for kyats at a fixed rate at FEC exchange centers. There is also an illegal parallel market that exchanges U.S. dollars for kyats at a premium over the parallel market FEC rate. Holders of FECs may open foreign currency accounts and/or deposit their FECs into their foreign exchange accounts.Managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rateThe kyat is officially pegged to the SDR at K 8.50847 per SDR 1 within margins of ±2%. The exchange rates of the kyat for the euro, Indian rupee, yen, Pakistani rupee, pound sterling, Singapore dollar, Sri Lanka rupee, Swiss franc, and the U.S. dollar are determined on the basis of the daily calculations of the value of these currencies against the SDR. The exchange rates for other currencies are determined on the basis of the daily foreign exchange rates in the Singapore market.
The exchange rate of the parallel market, through which the majority of foreign exchange transactions take place, is determined freely.Exchange taxNo.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketNo.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.Arrangements for Payments and Receipts

Import taxes and/or tariffs

primarily plants, animals, and products considered dangerous to human health or not in the public interest.
For nonprimary produce, tariffs apply to imported products that compete with New Zealand’s domestic production. Most primary produce competing with New Zealand’s domestic production is admitted free of tariff. Overall, 95% of imports (by value) are free of duty.
Tariffs on imports from nonpreferential sources are generally in the range of 6% to 7%.
Under New Zealand’s unilateral tariff reduction program, these tariffs (along with 10% tariffs) will gradually be reduced to 5% by July 2008. Higher tariff rates of 17% on clothing, footwear, carpets, ambulances, and motor homes will gradually be reduced to 10% by 2009.
New Zealand also provides tariff preferences on a multilateral, bilateral, and regional basis. Tariffs on goods originating from Brunei Darussalam, Chile, and Thailand were reduced to
10% on January 1, 2007, and will gradually be reduced further to become duty-free on January 1, 2010. Goods originating from Australia, Canada, Singapore, least developed countries, and Forum Island countries are free of duty. Eligible imports from developing countries are also granted tariff preferences.

NIGER
(Position as of January 31, 2007)
Status under IMF Articles of Agreement
Article VIIIDate of acceptance: June 1, 1996.
Exchange MeasuresRestrictions and/or multiple currency practices
International security restrictionsNo restrictions as reported in the latest staff report as of December 31, 2006.Other security restrictionsA framework has been established at the WAEMU regional level to combat the financing of terrorism in the member states of the union. The framework facilitates the enforcement of the decisions on the freezing of funds made by the Sanctions Committee of the UN
Security Council, based on the list of persons and entities established by that committee.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksRegulation 14/2002/CM/UEMOA by the WAEMU Council of Ministers of September 19, 2002; www.uemoa.int/actes/Default.htm; www.bceao.int.
Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Niger is the CFA franc.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Conventional pegged arrangementNiger participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at a fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris foreign exchange market vis-à-vis the euro. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the WAEMU countries has been reclassified to the category conventional pegged arrangement from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change, and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members.Exchange taxA symmetrical bank commission of 0.3% applies to transfers to all countries outside the WAEMU. The proceeds of this commission must be surrendered in their entirety to the treasury. In addition, banks are allowed to charge an exchange commission of up to 2% on over-the-counter exchange for euros.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketResidents are authorized to contract forward exchange cover for payments related to imports and exports of goods and services. Forward cover may be contracted only in the currency of settlement stipulated in the commercial contract. Maturities must correspond to the due date of the import or export payment stipulated in the commercial contract.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.Arrangements for Payments and Receipts
Prescription of currency	Niger is linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account, through which requirements	settlements with France, Monaco, and other Operations Account countries (WAEMU and CAEMC member countries and the Comoros) are made in euros or in the currency of any other Operations Account country. Settlements outside the Operations Account may be conducted freely in CFA francs.
Controls on the use of domestic currency
For capital transactionsTransactions in derivatives and other instrumentsYes.Use of foreign exchange among residents
Payments arrangementsThe CFA franc is the only legal tender, and residents are not permitted to use foreign exchange for domestic transactions.Regional arrangementsAn Operations Account is maintained with the French Treasury that links Operations Account countries. All purchases or sales of foreign currencies or euros against CFA francs are ultimately settled through a debit or credit to the Operations Account.Clearing agreementsA multilateral clearing agreement exists in the context of the WAMA among the countries of the WAEMU, Cape Verde, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. All payments related to current transactions between the member bank countries may be effected under the clearing arrangements. However, this excludes transactions specified by the committee of governors of the CBs of ECOWAS member countries and payments related to the exportation from the country of a member bank to the country of another member bank of finished products originating in countries whose CB or monetary authority is not a member of the WAMA.Administration of controlExchange control is administered jointly by the MOF and the BCEAO. Most of the authority to supervise foreign exchange transactions is delegated to authorized banks, which are required to report these operations to the MOF. The BCEAO is also authorized to collect— either directly or through banks, financial institutions, the postal administration, or judicial agents—any information necessary to compile balance of payments statistics. Customs officers monitor outflows of foreign exchange and confirm import and export of goods. All residents of WAEMU countries are treated as residents of Niger for the purposes of financial transactions. All foreign exchange operations with foreign countries must be effected through authorized intermediary banks, the postal administration, or the BCEAO. No supporting documents are required for transfers of up to the equivalent of CFAF 300,000. Within the framework of the regional financial market, the placement and soliciting of foreign and domestic securities in Niger require prior authorization by the RCPSFM.Payments arrears
Controls on trade in gold (coins and/or bullion)No.On external trade
Controls on exports and imports of banknotes
On exportsImports of gold require prior MOF authorization. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports by or on behalf of the treasury or the BCEAO, (2) imports of manufactured articles containing minor quantities of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles), and (3) imports by travelers of gold objects up to a combined weight of 500 grams. Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Exports of gold have been liberalized.Domestic currencyCFA franc banknotes may be exported freely by travelers. However, the suspension of
BCEAO repurchases of exported banknotes continues. In addition, the exchange of BCEAO banknotes between authorized intermediaries and their correspondents outside the WAEMU is prohibited.Foreign currencyThe reexportation of foreign banknotes by nonresident travelers is allowed up to the equivalent of CFAF 500,000; the reexportation of foreign banknotes above this ceiling requires documentation demonstrating either the importation of the foreign banknotes ortheir purchase against other means of payment registered in the name of the traveler or through the use of nonresident deposit accounts in local banks.
On importsForeign currencyResidents and nonresidents may bring in any amount of foreign banknotes and coins (except gold coins) of countries outside the Operations Account area. Residents bringing in foreign banknotes and foreign currency traveler’s checks exceeding the equivalent of CFAF 300,000 must declare them to customs on entry and sell them to an authorized intermediary bank within eight days.

(Position as of December 31, 2006)
Status under IMF Articles of Agreement
Article XIVYes.
Exchange MeasuresRestrictions and/or multiple currency practicesThe staff report for the second review under the Policy Support Instrument with Nigeria states that as of December 6, 2006, the comprehensive assessment by IMF staff was needed to identify the extent of remaining restrictions and multiple currency practices. (Country Report No. 07/20)International security restrictionsNo.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.
Exchange ArrangementCurrency
Exchange rate structureThe currency of Nigeria is the Nigerian naira.Multiple
ClassificationThere are four exchange rates: (1) the official exchange rate, which results from auctions of foreign exchange by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN); (2) the interbank market exchange rate, at which commercial banks transact among themselves using proceeds from non-oil exports and personal transfers; (3) the exchange bureau rate; and (4) the parallel market rate.
During 2006, the rates in the four markets largely converged.Conventional pegged arrangementEffective January 1, 2006, reflecting the stability of the naira exchange rate owing to CBN interventions, the de facto exchange rate arrangement of Nigeria was reclassified to a conventional pegged arrangement from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. The authorities have indicated that their current policy is to pursue a managed float. The official exchange rate of the naira is determined in the twice-weekly wholesale Dutch auction system (WDAS), which was introduced on February 20, 2006.
Previously, a retail Dutch auction system (DAS) prevailed, in which banks bid on behalf of legitimate users to purchase foreign exchange from the CBN with requests supported by the required documentation. The auction is a sealed bid–multiple price system. The CBN announces the amount on offer the day before the auction, and the auction results the day after. Effective April 1, 2006, the exchange bureaus are allowed access to the official foreign exchange market.
The interbank rate is freely negotiable among ADs, including commercial banks. Funds obtained through the DAS are not eligible for utilization in the interbank market.
Nigeria participates in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires that the spot exchange rate between the Nigerian naira and the dollar be maintained within margins of ±15% around the central rate. However, the CBN has not yet implemented these measures.Exchange taxNo.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketForward exchange transactions in the interbank market are permitted among the ADs in foreign exchange and between the dealers and their customers, subject to prudential limits and provided the transactions relate to trade in goods and services.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksUpdated Monetary Policies and Foreign Trade, and Exchange Rate Circulars for 2006, www.cenbank.org; CBN Foreign Exchange Manual, September 2006 (Revised).Arrangements for Payments and Receipts

Holders of frozen (old) FCAs are permitted to purchase special dollar bonds of the government ofPakistan against the outstanding balances in their FCAs or to convert the foreign currency into rupees at the prevailing exchange rate.

Imports and Import PaymentsForeign exchange budgetNo.Financing requirements for importsNo.Documentation requirements for release of foreign exchange for importsNo.Import licenses and other nontariff measuresFor rice products, pork meat, poultry meat, and tomato paste and puree, a contingent mechanism was negotiated under the WTO Agreement to facilitate the exchange of permits,thereby allowing imports of these products at preferential tariff rates.
All tariff rates are calculated on an ad valorem basis and are assessed on the c.i.f. value of imports. Trade reform has resulted in simplified tariff bands of zero, 3%, 5%, 10%, and 15%. The exceptions to the maximum tariff of 15% are automobiles (17%) and sugar (50% on imports exceeding a historical average price range). Also included are several other products (mainly foodstuffs) whose tariffs are the maximum (and declining) levels negotiated with the WTO, including dairy products (90%–173%); rice (130%); onions (90%); beef (40%); pork (70%–90%); boneless and whole hams (83%); some poultry
(300%); cabbages, carrots, celery, and lettuce (32.5%); cooking oils (20%–30%); margarine (20%); salt (87%); ketchup (70%); and tomato paste and puree (87%). All imports into the area designated as the Colón Free Zone and the newly established EPZs are exempt from duties.
A free trade agreement with the United States was reached in principle, reducing tariffs of
88% of U.S. imports to a zero rate, phasing out the remainder over 10 years, increasing quotas of agricultural imports, simplifying and harmonizing sanitary requirements, and clarifying market access for public procurement (including the Panama Canal Authorities). Implementation of the agreement is expected in 2007.

The Eastern Caribbean dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar, under a currency board arrangement, at EC$2.70 per US$1. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the ECCU countries has been reclassified to the category currency board arrangement from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender.

Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Samoa is the Samoa tala.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Conventional pegged arrangementThe exchange rate is determined on the basis of a fixed relationship with a weighted basket of currencies of Samoa’s main trading partners—the Australian dollar, euro, Fiji dollar, New Zealand dollar, and U.S. dollar. The weights are based on the distribution of trade, private remittances, and travel transactions of Samoa.

Administration of control Overall responsibility for the administration of exchange control rests with the CBS, which delegates part of its powers to AD banks and selected foreign exchange dealers. In principle, all payments to nonresidents require CBS approval. However, only commercial banks are empowered to approve current payments without limits, provided there are documents to support these transactions. Money transfer companies, however, are allowed transactions up to SAT 100,000 for import payments only; every other transaction is also subject to limits. All capital payments require CBS approval. Money exchange, money transfer companies, and commercial banks are allowed to exchange cash to purchase or sell foreign exchange equivalent to SAT 20,000 an individual.

Status under IMF Articles of Agreement
Article XIVYes.
Exchange MeasuresRestrictions and/or multiple currency practicesThe staff report for the third review of the Three-Year Arrangement with São Tomé and Príncipe states that as of December 29, 2006, São Tomé and Príncipe maintained exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval under Article VIII. The authorities intend to remove the exchange restriction on transfers abroad of dividends with the new Investment Code. The remaining exchange restriction and multiple currency practice is related to the possibility of rationing at the auctions by the central bank, and of commercial bank rates deviating, temporarily, by more than 2 percent from the Banco Central de São Tomé and Príncipe (BCSTP) reference rate in between auctions. In 2006, the multiple currency practice related to the spread between the central bank buying and selling rate was eliminated and the spread was set at 2 percent.

Exchange ArrangementCurrency
Exchange rate structureThe currency of São Tomé and Príncipe is the São Tomé and Príncipe dobra.Dual
ClassificationEffective December 29, 2006, the exchange rate structure was reclassified to dual because exchange rates applied by the commercial banks may differ by more than 2% from the BCSTP reference rate between auctions.Managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rateThe official exchange rate is determined on a daily basis as 40% of commercial banks’ weighted average rate of the previous day and 60% of the central bank’s rate on the previous day. The central bank rate is the outcome of foreign exchange auctions if a foreign exchange auction is held. The intervention currency is the dollar. Rates for certain other currencies are determined on the basis of cross-rates between the dollar and the currencies concerned. In August 2006, the central bank suspended its foreign exchange auctions and reverted to direct sales, but reinstalled the auction in December 2006.Exchange taxTax rates vary according to the type of transaction involved. On import-related exchange transactions, when an LC is opened, a stamp duty of 0.25% of the import value and a postage levy of the equivalent of $2 are payable. On foreign checks for collection, commercial banks charge a commission of $2 a transaction. For the collection of export proceeds, a commission of 0.125% (a minimum of $25 and a maximum of $300) is charged when the LC is opened, and an additional fee of 0.125% is levied when the funds are received. A postage levy of Db 39,000 is also charged.

Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Senegal is the CFA franc.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Conventional pegged arrangementSenegal participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at the rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market vis-à-vis the euro. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the WAEMU countries has been reclassified to the category conventional pegged arrangement from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change, and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members.Exchange taxA symmetrical bank commission of 0.3% applies to transfers to all countries outside the WAEMU. The proceeds of this commission must be surrendered in their entirety to the treasury. In addition, banks are allowed to charge an exchange commission of up to 2% on over-the-counter exchange for euros.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketResidents are authorized to contract forward exchange cover for payments related to imports and exports of goods and services.

Controls on the use of domestic currency
For capital transactionsSenegal is linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account, through which settlements with France, Monaco, and other Operations Account countries (WAEMU and CAEMC member countries and the Comoros) are made in euros or in the currency of any other Operations Account country. Settlements outside the Operations Account may be conducted freely in CFA francs.Transactions in derivatives and other instrumentsYes.Use of foreign exchange among residents
Payments arrangementsThe CFA franc is the only legal tender, and residents are not permitted to use foreign exchange for domestic transactions.Regional arrangementsAn Operations Account is maintained with the French Treasury that links Operations Account countries. All purchases or sales of foreign currencies or euros against CFA francs are settled through a debit or credit to the Operations Account.Clearing agreementsA multilateral clearing agreement exists in the context of the WAMA among the countries of the WAEMU, Cape Verde, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. All payments related to current transactions between the member bank countries may be effected under the clearing arrangements. However, this excludes transactions specified by the committee of governors of the CBs of ECOWAS member countries and payments related to the exportation from the country of a member bank to the country of another member bank of finished products originating in countries whose CB or monetary authority is not a member of the WAMA.Administration of controlExchange control is administered jointly by the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and the BCEAO. Most of the authority to supervise foreign exchange transactions is delegated to authorized banks, which are required to report these operations to the MEF. The BCEAO is also authorized to collect—either directly or through banks, financial institutions, the postal administration, or judicial agents—any information necessary to compile balance of payments statistics. Customs officers monitor outflows of foreign exchange and confirm import and export of goods. All residents of WAEMU countries are treated as residents of Senegal for the purposes of financial transactions. All foreign exchange operations with foreign countries must be effected through authorized intermediary banks, the postal administration, or the BCEAO. No supporting documents are required for transfers of up to the equivalent of CFAF 300,000. Within the framework of the regional financial market, the placement and soliciting of foreign and domestic securities in Senegal require prior authorization by the RCPSFM.Payments arrears
Controls on trade in gold (coins and/or bullion)No.On external tradeImports and exports of gold require MEF authorization. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports by or on behalf of the treasury or the BCEAO, (2) imports of manufactured articles containing minor quantities of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles), and (3) imports by travelers of gold objects up to a combined weight of 500 grams. Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration.Controls on exports and imports of banknotes On exports
Domestic currencyCFA franc banknotes may be exported freely by travelers. CFA franc banknotes may be freely shipped by authorized intermediaries to their correspondents. However, the suspension of BCEAO repurchases of exported banknotes continues. In application of this measure, authorized intermediaries may not receive shipments of CFA franc banknotes from their correspondents outside the WAEMU area.Foreign currency
On importsThe reexportation of foreign banknotes by nonresident travelers is allowed up to the equivalent of CFAF 500,000; the reexportation of foreign banknotes above this ceiling requires documentation demonstrating either the importation of the foreign banknotes or their purchase against other means of payment registered in the name of the traveler or through the use of nonresident deposit accounts in local banks.Foreign currencyResidents and nonresidents may bring in any amount of foreign banknotes and coins (except gold coins) of countries outside the Operations Account area. Residents bringing in foreign banknotes and foreign currency traveler’s checks exceeding the equivalent of CFAF 300,000 must declare them to customs on entry and sell them to an authorized intermediary bank within eight days. Nonresident travelers must declare to customs foreign currency exceeding the equivalent of CFAF 1 million on entry and exit.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksRegulation 09/98/CM/UEMOA of December 20, 1998; www.bceao.int.

Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Serbia is the dinar.Exchange rate structureUnitary.
Classification
Managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate
Effective August 30, 2006, the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) adopted a new monetary policy regime. The new framework, which uses the two-week repo rate as the main monetary policy instrument, is anchored by the announcement of core inflation objectives, anticipating eventual transition to full-fledged inflation targeting. The exchange rate regime aims at gradually converging toward free floating of the dinar, with eventual full-fledged inflation targeting.
The Monetary Policy Program for 2006 envisaged that the NBS would gradually start to withdraw from exchange transactions, which implies that the licensed exchange offices would be redirected to commercial banks. Hence, effective August 7, 2006, the NBS allows licensed exchange offices to conclude agreements with either a bank, the NBS, several banks, a bank and the NBS, or several banks and the NBS.
The NBS intervenes in the fixing sessions, with the goals of attaining moderate excessive daily exchange rate volatility and guiding exchange rate expectations. As of August 7, 2006, the time of the fixing session was changed from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. to stimulate banks to effect most of their trade before the fixing session. The rate set at a fixing session applies to transactions conducted at the fixing session.
Effective August 8, 2006, the exchange rate of the dinar against the euro is determined at the start of each business day at the level that was set at the fixing sessions on the previous day. That exchange rate represents the official middle exchange of the dinar against the euro, and it applies on that business day. Exchange rate lists for the official middle exchange rate of the dinar for foreign exchange and foreign cash are applied from 8:00 a.m. on a given business day until the publication of subsequent exchange rate lists.
NBS purchases and sales of foreign exchange outside the fixing session take place within margins of ±0.3% for noncash transactions and ±0.7% for cash transactions.
Effective August 26, 2006, instead of charging a commission on NBS foreign exchange sales at the fixing session, the NBS introduced a commission for organizing the fixing session, which is 0.1% and is charged on each realized transaction.

A commission of 0.15% applies on sales of convertible foreign currencies (banknotes), except for the dollar, for which the commission is 2%. Effective March 5, 2007, the NBS stopped conducting trade in foreign cash currencies other than the euro, dollar, and Swiss franc with banks and licensed exchange offices. Banks are free to fix their own buying and selling rates for foreign exchange on the basis of supply and demand, but must observe the cross rates prevailing in the international market. Banks may buy and sell foreign exchange on the interbank market outside the fixing session at mutually agreed upon rates, and they may set the commissions for these services freely.
Effective January 1, 2007, the NBS stopped foreign exchange operations with resident and nonresident natural persons at its foreign offices and at automated teller machines in order to decrease its foreign exchange cash operations.
Effective March 5, 2007, the exchange rate of the dinar against the euro is fixed at the start of each business day at the level of the weighted average exchange rate of the dinar against the euro, based on total interbank spot trade recorded on the previous business day, including trade in the fixing session. The exchange rate calculated in this way represents the official middle rate of the dinar against the euro and it applies on that business day.
According to the 2007 Policy Program of the NBS, the NBS may intervene in the foreign exchange market to (1) limit daily volatility, but not to resist cumulative pressure over a longer period; (2) contain potential threats to financial and price stability; and (3) safeguard an adequate level of international reserves.

Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Seychelles is the Seychelles rupee.Other legal tenderVarious commemorative gold coins issued on several occasions since 1976 are also legal tender.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Conventional pegged arrangementThe Seychelles rupee is pegged to a weighted basket of currencies of Seychelles’s main trading and tourism partners. Effective October 10, 2006, the Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS) revised the reference basket for the Seychelles rupee to reflect the three main currencies, with their new respective weights as follows: euro (59.1%), pound sterling (30.2%) and U.S. dollar (10.7%). With the revision of the basket, the appreciation limit of SR 5.50 per US$1 has been removed. Previously the basket of currencies was as follows: euro (37.7%), yen (2.7%), pound sterling (15.7%), Singapore dollar (7.7%), South African rand (10.5%), and U.S. dollar (25.7%). Effective October 9, 2006, the appreciation limit of SR5.50 per US$1 has been removed. Consequently, the exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to the category conventional pegged arrangement against a composite from the category conventional pegged arrangement against a single currency. Exchange rates for various currencies are quoted on the basis of their New York closing rates for the U.S. dollar on the previous day, using the dollar rate for the Seychelles rupee as derived from the fixed parity to the currency basket or the appreciation limit of the rupee. The CBS circulates these rates daily to commercial banks. The CBS charges a commission of 0.125% on purchases and 0.875% on sales of euros, pounds sterling, and U.S. dollars.
Commercial banks are authorized to deal in pounds sterling and other currencies at rates based on the exchange rates circulated daily by the CBS. Effective August 15, 2006, one exchange bureau is allowed to sell foreign currency to tourists under the same controls as commercial banks. Other ADs include casinos, guesthouses, hotels, restaurants, selfcatering establishments, tour operators, travel agents, car rental services, boat charters, shipping agents, and ship chandlers. These dealers are restricted to buying only in the course of their licensed activity.

Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Sierra Leone is the Sierra Leonean leone.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Crawling pegThe authorities have adopted a policy of gradually adjusting the central exchange rate visà-vis the U.S. dollar. As a result, the exchange rate regime has been reclassified, effective January 1, 2006, to the category crawling peg from the category independently floating.
Within these limits, the exchange rate of the leone is determined in the interbank market. Commercial banks and licensed foreign exchange bureaus may buy and sell foreign exchange with customers and trade freely among themselves or with the Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL). The BSL determines the exchange rate to be used in official transactions, including the rate for customs valuation purposes, which is based on the weighted average mid-rate of purchases and sales made by commercial banks and foreign exchange bureaus during the past five business days and at the weekly auction. The official buying and selling rates are set within ±1% of the official mid-rate. Foreign exchange bureaus are limited to spot transactions and are not allowed to sell traveler’s checks. Sierra Leone participates in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ and maintains the spot exchange rate between the leone and the dollar within margins of ±15% around the central rate of Le 2,932.52 per $1; however, the BSL has yet to implement these measures.Exchange taxNo.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketNo.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.Arrangements for Payments and Receipts

Controls on trade in gold (coins and/or bullion)No.On domestic ownership and/or tradeResidents of South Africa may purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in South Africa for numismatic purposes and investment, but only monetary authorities, ADs, registered gold producers, and authorized industrial and professional users are allowed to purchase, hold, or sell gold in any form other than jewelry. Gold producers may elect to sell their total output to approved counterparties, provided the SARB has given the necessary exemption from the relevant exchange control regulations. This includes sales to foreign counterparties. The current exchange control regulations pertaining to the repatriation of export proceeds remain applicable to gold exports. The mint strikes gold coins and Krugerrand, which are legal tender, without a face value, and these are made available in limited numbers to the local market.On external trade
Controls on exports and imports of banknotes
On exportsAll exports of gold must be approved in advance by the SARB. ADs are permitted by the SARB to approve exports of jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler (subject to a written declaration that the jewelry will be brought back to South Africa on the traveler’s return). Exports of gold jewelry by manufacturing jewelers are subject to a written declaration that the articles are in fully manufactured form and that the gold content of each does not exceed 85% of the selling price to the ultimate consignee. Furthermore, after approval by the SARB, residents are allowed to export currency coins, including certain gold coins, for sale to numismatists.Domestic currencyBanknotes up to R 5,000 may be exported, but this amount is not regarded as part of the basic travel allowance. The limitation does not apply to migrant workers returning to neighboring countries, who are permitted to take with them reasonable amounts in banknotes. There are no limitations on the exportation of domestic currency to Lesotho, Namibia, and Swaziland. Foreign visitors leaving South Africa may take with them up to R 5,000 in SARB banknotes.South African banknotes repatriated from Angola, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe may be remitted on submission of documentary evidence that they were not exported from South Africa in contravention of the exchange control regulations.

Foreign currency
On importsResidents and contract workers leaving South Africa for destinations outside the CMA may take out their allowance in foreign banknotes. Foreign visitors leaving South Africa may take with them any amount of foreign banknotes brought into the country or obtained through the disposal of instruments of exchange brought into and converted in South Africa.Domestic currencyThe limit on banknotes that may be imported from countries outside the CMA is the equivalent of R 5,000.

This requirement does not affect the transferability of funds.Approval requiredForeign currency accounts may be opened for nonresidents, and funds in these accounts may be transferred abroad without restriction.Domestic currency accountsThese accounts may be credited with all authorized payments by residents, with the proceeds of sales of foreign currency to ADs, and with payments from other nonresident accounts. They may be debited for payments to CMA residents for any purpose (other than loans), for payments to nonresidents for any purpose, for transfer to a local nonresident account or for remittance to any country outside the CMA, for payments of the cost of purchases of any foreign currency, and for payments to account holders residing in South Africa for short periods.Convertible into foreign currencyYes.
Blocked accountsThese accounts are opened for emigrants from the CMA and are subject to exchange control restrictions. Cash or proceeds from any other South African asset held at the time of departure and subsequently sold must be credited to this type of account. These funds may not be transferred abroad except with approval and subject to a 10% exit levy or transferred to another emigrant-blocked account in South Africa, but must be retained on deposit with an AD and used within certain limits for the holder’s living expenses while visiting South Africa, for other specified payments to residents, or for investment in any locally quoted securities (such securities may not, however, be exported and sold abroad).References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.

SURINAME
(Position as of December 31, 2006)
Status under IMF Articles of Agreement
Article VIIIDate of acceptance: June 29, 1978.
Exchange MeasuresRestrictions and/or multiple currency practices
International security restrictionsThe staff report for the 2005 Article IV consultation with Suriname states that as of February 8, 2006, Suriname maintained multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval arising from (i) the absence of a mechanism to prevent a possible deviation of more than 2 percent between the official exchange rate used for government transactions and the marketdetermined bank/cambios rate and (ii) the preferential exchange rate for infant formula imports. (Country Report No. 06/135)Other security restrictionsn.a.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.
Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Suriname is the Surinamese dollar.Other legal tender
Exchange rate structureSixteen commemorative gold coins are legal tender.Multiple
ClassificationAn official exchange rate is used for about 20% of all foreign exchange transactions, and a commercial exchange rate, which is more flexible, is used by commercial banks and exchange bureaus to handle all other foreign exchange transactions. The government of Suriname provides a subsidy to imports of infant formula according to a mechanism whereby 50% of the counter value is paid by the MOF (50% of the exchange rate multiplied by the foreign exchange amount).Conventional pegged arrangementThe official exchange rate is pegged at SRD 2.75 per U.S. dollar. The exchange rate of the Surinamese dollar vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar in the official and parallel markets remained stable.Exchange taxNo.Exchange subsidyn.a.Forward exchange marketNo.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.Arrangements for Payments and Receipts

Exchange rate structureThe currency of the Syrian Arab Republic is the Syrian pound.DualEffective January 1, 2007, the exchange rate system consists of two rates: first, the legally designated official rate of LS 11.20/11.25 per $1, which applies to the repayment of loans and interest arising from bilateral payments agreements, pending agreements on their rescheduling; and second, the exchange rate for all other transactions, which unified the other exchange rates. As a result, the exchange rate structure has been reclassified to the category dual from the category multiple. Previously, the state and public sector “budget rate” of LS 50 per $1 constituted the second rate. This rate applied to (1) payments for public sector exports, including the export of crude oil and petroleum; (2) all public sector imports; (3) repayment of loans not related to bilateral payments agreements; (4) public sector remittances from abroad; and (5) all other public sector enterprise foreign exchange transactions. Third, the free market foreign exchange rate was set to reflect developments in the free market exchange rates offshore in Beirut and Amman and applied to foreign exchange sales by authorized banks for (1) private sector purchases of foreign exchange for noncommercial transactions, including medical, study, religious, and travel expenses; (2) the extension of credit to importers of raw material needed for exports; (3) private sector exports; and (4) private sector remittances and receipts from the export of services. Fourth, the unofficial rate was the free market rate, which was the rate in certain cities in the region (mainly Amman and Beirut) and in Syria that applied to (1) private sector import payments not financed by banks, (2) private sector remittances and services receipts and payments, and (3) private capital flows. The free market rate was determined by private supply and demand, with market participants matching their needs through brokers or dealers in the offshore market.Classification

Previously, foreign exchange was available for a portion (about 60%) of the private sector imports. All other private imports had to be financed with the importers’ own resources through external credit arrangements, foreign currency deposits maintained in the Syrian Arab Republic by residents, or foreign exchange purchased fromother private or mixed enterprises through the intermediation of authorized banks at the free market rate.
Advance import deposits
Documentation requirements for release of foreign exchange for importsA non-interest-bearing advance deposit is required for public sector imports in an amount equal to 100% of the value of the imports.

Imports must come directly from the country of origin, but the MOET has the authority to permit certain goods to be imported from countries other than the country of origin.Negative listThere is a general list of goods that may not be imported.Other nontariff measuresImports from the Syrian free zones are allowed for certain industrial goods and for goods imported directly from the country of origin. Imports of commodities originating in Israel are prohibited.Import taxes and/or tariffsAn import surcharge of 2% is applied to all imports; government imports and imports of certain essential items are exempt.

Provisions Specific to the Financial Sector
Provisions specific to commercial banks and other credit institutions
Borrowing abroadThe limit that nonresidents may lend to domestic financial institutions is B 50 million or its equivalent. Effective December 4, 2006, this limit applies to loans granted by nonresidents without underlying transactions with maturities of less than or equal to six months (previously, three months).Lending to nonresidents (financial or commercial credits)In cases in which there are no underlying trade and investment activities in Thailand, baht credit instruments in any form obtained by a nonresident from all domestic financial institutions combined are subject to a maximum outstanding limit of B 50 million or its equivalent. The nonresident’s head office, branches, representative offices, and affiliated companies are counted as one entity. Direct loans in baht provided by financial institutions may be made to entities in neighboring countries (i.e., Cambodia, southern parts of China, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, and Vietnam) under specified conditions and with prior BOT approval. Financial institutions are allowed to extend direct loans in baht with collateral to nonresident natural persons permitted to work in Thailand for not less than one year.Lending locally in foreign exchangeCommercial lending denominated in foreign currencies to particular industries may be partially (50%) included as foreign assets in order to recognize the potential risk that banks may not be fully repaid as exchange rate risk increases.Purchase of locally issued securities denominated in foreign exchangeCommercial banks may purchase locally issued securities denominated in foreign exchange. Finance companies without foreign exchange licenses are required to obtain BOT permission for purchases of locally issued securities in foreign exchange.Differential treatment of deposit accounts held by nonresidents

However, after the 10-year period, they will not be allowed to purchase additional shares unless their holding is less than 49% of the total amount of shares sold. The combined shareholdings of an individual and related family members may not exceed 5% of a bank’s total amount of shares sold and 10% of that of finance companies and credit foncier companies.Open foreign exchange position limitsThe regulation on net foreign exchange exposure limits allows commercial banks to maintain a position for each currency relative to its capital fund not exceeding 15% or $5 million, whichever is greater, and to maintain an aggregate position relative to its capital fund not exceeding 20% or $10 million, whichever is greater.Provisions specific to institutional investors

Article VIIIDate of acceptance: June 1, 1996.
Exchange MeasuresRestrictions and/or multiple currency practices
International security restrictionsNo restrictions as reported in the latest staff report as of December 31, 2006.Other security restrictionsA framework has been established at the WAEMU regional level to combat the financing of terrorism in the member states of the union. The framework facilitates the enforcement of the decisions on the freezing of funds made by the Sanctions Committee of the UN
Security Council, based on the list of persons and entities established by that committee.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksRegulation 14/2002/CM/UEMOA by the WAEMU Council of Ministers of September 19, 2002; www.uemoa.int/actes/Default.htm; www.bceao.int.
Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Togo is the CFA franc.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Conventional pegged arrangementTogo participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at the rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris foreign exchange market vis-à-vis the euro. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the WAEMU countries has been reclassified to the category conventional pegged arrangement from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change, and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members.Exchange taxA symmetrical bank commission of 0.3% applies to transfers to all countries outside the WAEMU. The proceeds of this commission must be surrendered in their entirety to the treasury. In addition, banks are allowed to charge an exchange commission of up to 2% on over-the-counter exchange for euros.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketResidents are authorized to contract forward exchange cover for payments related to imports and exports of goods and services. Forward cover may be contracted only in the currency of settlement stipulated in the commercial contract. Maturities must correspond to the due date of the import or export payment stipulated in the commercial contract.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.Arrangements for Payments and Receipts
Prescription of currency	Togo is linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account, through which requirements	settlements with France, Monaco, and other Operations Account countries (WAEMU and CAEMC member countries and the Comoros) are made in euros or in the currency of any other Operations Account country. Settlements outside the Operations Account may be conducted freely in CFA francs.
Controls on the use of domestic currency
For capital transactionsTransactions in derivatives and other instrumentsYes.Use of foreign exchange among residents
Payments arrangementsThe CFA franc is the only legal tender, and residents are not permitted to use foreign exchange for domestic transactions.Regional arrangementsAn Operations Account is maintained with the French Treasury that links Operations Account countries. All purchases or sales of foreign currencies or euros against CFA francs are ultimately settled through a debit or credit to the Operations Account.Clearing agreementsA multilateral clearing agreement exists in the context of the WAMA among the countries of the WAEMU, Cape Verde, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. All payments related to current transactions between the member bank countries may be effected under the clearing arrangements. However, this excludes transactions specified by the committee of governors of the CBs of ECOWAS member countries and payments related to the exportation from the country of a member bank to the country of another member bank of finished products originating in countries whose CB or monetary authority is not a member of the WAMA.Administration of control
Payments arrearsExchange control is administered jointly by the MOF and the BCEAO. Most of the authority to supervise foreign exchange transactions is delegated to authorized banks, which are required to report these operations to the MOF. The BCEAO is also authorized to collect— either directly or through banks, financial institutions, the postal administration, or judicial agents—any information necessary to compile balance of payments statistics. Customs officers monitor outflows of foreign exchange and confirm import and export of goods. All residents of WAEMU countries are treated as residents of Togo for the purposes of financial transactions. All foreign exchange operations with foreign countries must be effected through authorized intermediary banks, the postal administration, or the BCEAO. No supporting documents are required for transfers of up to the equivalent of CFAF 300,000. Within the framework of the regional financial market, the placement and soliciting of foreign and domestic securities in Togo require prior authorization by the RCPSFM.Official
Controls on trade in gold (coins and/or bullion)Yes.On external trade
Controls on exports and imports of banknotes
On exportsImports of gold require prior MOF authorization. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports by or on behalf of the treasury or the BCEAO, (2) imports of manufactured articles containing minor quantities of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles), and (3) imports by travelers of gold objects up to a combined weight of 500 grams. Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Exports of gold have been liberalized.Domestic currencyCFA franc banknotes may be exported freely by travelers. However, the suspension of
BCEAO repurchases of exported banknotes continues. In addition, the exchange of BCEAO banknotes between authorized intermediaries and their correspondents outside the WAEMU is prohibited.Foreign currencyThe reexportation of foreign banknotes by nonresident travelers is allowed up to the equivalent of CFAF 500,000; the reexportation of foreign banknotes above this ceilingrequires documentation demonstrating either the importation of the foreign banknotes or their purchase against other means of payment registered in the name of the traveler or through the use of nonresident deposit accounts in local banks.
On importsForeign currencyResidents and nonresidents may bring in any amount of foreign banknotes and coins (except gold coins) of countries outside the Operations Account area. Residents bringing in foreign banknotes and foreign currency traveler’s checks exceeding the equivalent of CFAF 300,000 must declare them to customs on entry and sell them to an authorized intermediary bank within eight days. Nonresident travelers must declare to customs foreign currency exceeding the equivalent of CFAF 1 million on entry and exit.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksRegulation 09/98/CM/UEMOA of December 20, 1998; www.bceao.int.

Nonresident AccountsForeign exchange accounts permittedYes.Approval requiredThe holding by nonresidents of accounts denominated in foreign currency other than the euro is subject to prior authorization by the BCEAO. The opening of the account is subject to presentation of documents by nonresidents proving their status and actual residence.Domestic currency accountsBecause the BCEAO has suspended the repurchase of banknotes circulating outside the WAEMU area, nonresident accounts may not be credited or debited with BCEAO banknotes. These accounts may not be overdrawn without prior MOF authorization.
Transfers of funds between nonresident accounts are not restricted.Convertible into foreign currencyConvertible foreign currency accounts may be debited freely for the purchase by nonresidents of foreign currencies on the official exchange market.Blocked accountsNo.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksRegulation 09/98/CM/UEMOA of December 20, 1998; www.bceao.int.Imports and Import Payments

Securities and mutual funds issued outside the WAEMU by a private or public entity that is not a resident of a member country may not be listed on a regional securities exchange.Purchase locally by nonresidentsThese purchases are subject to prior declaration to the MOF for statistical purposes.Sale or issue locally by nonresidentsThe issue of securities and the sale of corporate or foreign securities by nonresidents are subject to prior RCPSFM authorization. There are no controls on the sale of securities resulting from the divestiture of investment in the form of a transfer between a nonresident and a resident, but such sales are subject to the regulations governing the financial settlement of the operation.
Settlement of securities transactions by transfer abroad or by credit to a nonresident account requires an exchange authorization to be submitted to the MOF for approval, accompanied by supporting documentation.Purchase abroad by residentsThe purchase of foreign securities by residents and the transfer abroad of funds for this purpose are subject to prior authorization by the MOF. Authorization is not required for purchases of foreign securities whose issuance or offering for sale in WAEMU countries has been authorized by the RCPSFM.Sale or issue abroad by residentsResidents may sell local corporate securities abroad. If these operations result in foreign control of domestic establishments, foreign investors are required to make a prior declaration to the MOF. The sale of securities to liquidate an investment abroad is subject to declaration to the MOF for statistical purposes.Residents may also issue securities abroad, except for those constituting a loan. Issuance of the latter to nonresidents must be made through an authorized bank and must be reported to the MOF for statistical purposes.
Bonds or other debt securitiesThe regulations governing shares or other securities of a participating nature apply.Sale or issue locally by nonresidentsYes.Purchase abroad by residentsYes.Sale or issue abroad by residentsYes.On money market instrumentsThe regulations governing shares or other securities of a participating nature apply.Sale or issue locally by nonresidentsYes.Purchase abroad by residentsYes.Sale or issue abroad by residentsResidents may sell money market instruments abroad.

Mere participation is not considered direct investment unless it exceeds 20% of the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. All investments abroad by residents, including investments through foreign companies under the direct or indirect control of residents of Togo and investments by foreign branches or subsidiaries of companies established in Togo, require prior authorization by the MOF.Outward direct investmentAll investment abroad by residents is subject to prior MOF authorization.

Status under IMF Articles of Agreement
Article VIIIDate of acceptance: January 6, 1993.
Exchange MeasuresRestrictions and/or multiple currency practices
International security restrictionsThe staff report for the 2006 Article IV consultation with Tunisia states that as of May 10, 2006, Tunisia maintained a multiple currency practice resulting from honoring exchange rate guarantees extended prior to August 1988 to development banks, which will automatically expire after the existing commitments have matured. (Country Report No. 06/207)Other security restrictionsYes.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.
Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Tunisia is the Tunisian dinar.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rateThe exchange rate of the dinar is determined in the interbank market in which commercial banks, including offshore banks acting on behalf of their resident customers, conduct transactions at freely negotiated rates. There is no limit on the spread between the buying and selling rates. The Central Bank of Tunisia (CBT) intervenes in the market and publishes an indicative interbank exchange rate for foreign currencies and banknotes by the following day. The CBT pursues a real effective exchange rate rule. Resident banks trade freely in foreign currencies in the spot market among themselves, with their foreign correspondents, and with nonresident banks in Tunisia.Exchange taxNo.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketImporters and exporters are authorized to obtain forward exchange cover on the interbank market as of the date the contract is signed or the date on which the foreign commercial paper is domiciled, depending on the arrangements for the product concerned. Forward rates are freely negotiated by the authorized counterpart bank. Forward cover may be established for up to 12 months for imports and up to 9 months for exports. Persons who provide services are eligible for exchange cover for up to 12 months, to be provided within 30 days of the date on which the claim originated. Resident enterprises may purchase, in the forward market, futures maturing in up to 12 months to hedge against exchange risks related to the repayment of their foreign currency loans. They may also sell, for terms of up to 12 months, the foreign currency from drawings on external loans or from foreign currency investments.Nonresidents may enter into contracts with resident authorized intermediaries for forward purchases of convertible dinars, maturing in up to 12 months. Resident authorized intermediaries may engage in, among themselves or with resident enterprises, foreign currency/convertible dinar swaps, maturing in up to 12 months. They may also engage in foreign currency/convertible dinar swaps with nonresident banks operating in Tunisia, their foreign correspondent banks, and nonresident enterprises operating in Tunisia, to make spot purchases and forward sales of convertible dinars. For the purposes of hedging against foreign currency interest rate risks, forward rate agreements may be signed for terms of 12 months by resident banks with foreign correspondent banks and by resident enterprises with resident banks and nonresident banks operating in Tunisia. Residents contracting such foreign currency loans may also purchase 3-, 6-, and 12-month foreign currency options in dollars or euros. Call options in other currencies may be listed on request. Authorized intermediaries may set the forward exchange rates for foreign currencies against dinars applied to customers’ forward transactions in accordance with the procedures followed in international markets.
Official cover of forward operationsThe national reinsurance company manages this exchange cover mechanism for banks and financial institutions with respect to their borrowing abroad.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksLaw 58-109 of October 18, 1958, Effecting Monetary Reform; Circular 2001-11 of May 4,

Effective September 13, 2006, these settlements may also be effected in foreign currencies accepted by the respective CBs.Controls on the use of domestic currencyPayments in dinars may be made abroad or from abroad through convertible dinar foreign accounts maintained domestically in the name of the foreign creditors or debtors or of their banks, respectively.For current transactions and payments
For capital transactionsYes.Transactions in capital and money market instrumentsYes.Transactions in derivatives and other instrumentsYes.Credit operationsYes.Use of foreign exchange among residents
Payments arrangementsThe dinar is the currency of account and the currency of payment in transactions among residents, unless otherwise authorized by the CBT, subsequent to approval from the MOF.Regional arrangementsSettlements with Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, and Morocco may be effected through convertible national currency accounts at the respective CBs.Administration of controlExchange control is administered by the CBT. The CBT delegates authority over payments for imports and most invisibles to the authorized banks, whereas the Ministry of Trade (MOT) administers foreign trade control, which entails issuing import and export authorization for the remaining products not covered by the liberalization of foreign trade.Payments arrears
Controls on trade in gold (coins and/or bullion)No.On domestic ownership and/or tradeOnly jewelry craftspeople, legal entities established by jewelry craftspeople to supply gold to their members, agencies legally authorized to process gold for use as a manufacturing input, and individuals requiring gold for scientific, training, or occasional uses may acquire gold from authorized importers.

Controls on exports and imports of banknotes
On exportsMonetary gold may be imported by the CBT as well as by one or more other agencies so authorized by decree. Imports and exports of other forms of gold are subject to prior authorization from the CBT and the Ministry of Trade.Domestic currencyEffective February 26, 2007, the prohibition on exports of dinar banknotes and coins has been eased in cases where the CBT has signed agreements to that effect with its counterparts or any other specialized authority abroad.Foreign currency

Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Ukraine is the Ukrainian hryvnia.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Conventional pegged arrangementThe National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) sets the official exchange rate of the hryvnia against the dollar on the basis of rate quotations and other indicators on Ukraine’s interbank foreign exchange market. The NBU intervenes with a view to curbing significant fluctuations in the exchange rate. The hryvnia, although appreciating by 7% since the end of 2000, has remained within a very narrow band vis-à-vis the dollar since end-2001, except for a step appreciation of 5% in April 2005. The official exchange rate is used by residents and nonresidents to account for foreign exchange transactions. Banks are allowed to purchase and sell foreign exchange on the same day.
Banks that have the right to open correspondent accounts at foreign banks must purchase foreign currency in the interbank market directly and not through other Ukrainian banks. In particular, banks are permitted to buy or sell foreign exchange cash at a contractual exchange rate.Exchange taxOn January 1, 2007, the fee on purchases of noncash foreign exchange used for government pension insurance was reduced to 1%, after it had been lowered on January 1, 2006, to 1.3% from 1.5%.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketBanks may conduct forward foreign exchange operations with a maturity of up to one year on their own behalf and on behalf of their clients. Banks may transact purchases of foreign currency in Group 1 of the NBU’s Classification of Foreign Currencies and Bank Metals, provided the long (short) open foreign exchange position of the bank for such transactions is not more than 10% (of regulated capital). Transactions with other foreign currency derivatives (such as futures and options) for which the underlying asset is a foreign currency or cross rate of a foreign currency are permitted in the interbank market; settlements on these contracts are in hryvnias.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksLaws on the 2006 State Budget of Ukraine and on the 2007 State Budget of Ukraine; Statute on Procedures and Conditions for Trading Foreign Currency, as approved by Resolution of the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine No. 281 of August 10, 2005.Arrangements for Payments and Receipts

The use of barter in foreign trade transactions is prohibited for a group of goods determined by the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers.Administration of controlThe NBU, authorized banks, financial institutions, the STA, the State Customs Committee, the Ukrainian Ministry of Communications, the Ukrpochta National Postal Communications Operator, and the Ministry of Economy administer exchange controls.Payments arrears
Controls on trade in gold (coins and/or bullion)No.On domestic ownership and/or tradeResidents are required to obtain a license from the MOF to deal in precious stones and metals, except for bank metals. The NBU licenses commercial bank transactions in bank metals.On external tradePermission for residents to export precious metals and precious stones is granted by the Ministry of Economy and European Integration in consultation with the MOF. Bank metals are imported only by authorized banks and do not require NBU permits. Resident legal entities are allowed to import bank metals refined from customer-supplied raw materials outside Ukraine using a special permit from the NBU if there is an agreement with the NBU to sell such metals.

Provisions specific to commercial banks and other credit institutions
Differential treatment of deposit accounts in foreign exchange
Reserve requirements
Differential treatment of deposit accounts held by nonresidentsThe mandatory minimum reserve requirements for deposits in local currency are 17%, 9%, 6%, and 4% for maturities of less than 30 days, 30 to 90 days, 91 to 180 days, and 181 to 367 days, respectively.
The mandatory reserve requirements on foreign currency interest-bearing deposits are 25% for maturities of less than 180 days and 19% for longer maturities. Certain banks have special instructions requiring higher reserve requirements. The reserve requirement position is calculated on the basis of daily deposits, including weekends, and must be held in deposits with the CBU or in notes and coins. For foreign currency deposits, at least 90% of the required reserves need to be complied with on a daily basis. For peso deposits, reserve balances are allowed to be less than the required level for up to four days a month without incurring a fine.Reserve requirementsForeign currency deposits of nonresidents are exempt from the foreign currency reserve requirement.Liquid asset requirementsAt least 30% of the foreign currency deposits of nonresidents are required to be held in a high-quality asset portfolio with a minimum of 15% in liquid assets. Effective May 1, 2007, liquidity requirements apply to domestic currency and foreign currency deposits of residents at the same rates as reserve ratios, although additional placements in foreign banks for less than 30 days and foreign government securities with an “investment grade” rating (BBB+ and higher) are eligible for inclusion in the composition of required liquidity. The new instruments may not be used to meet liquidity requirements until the instruments that may make up required reserves are changed.
In addition, the 30% liquidity requirement for nonresident deposits applies only to deposits maturing in or over a year.Open foreign exchange position limitsA ceiling is placed on foreign or local currency asset positions of 150% of the book value equity less administrative fixed assets (i.e., nonperforming loans that are two years or moreoverdue, fixed assets, investments, and deferred charges). The ceiling on the long or short asset-liability positions in foreign-currency-denominated “operations to be settled” (i.e., future contracts and sales of securities subject to repurchase agreements) is 150% of the book value equity less administrative fixed assets. In addition, there is a ceiling on the foreign currency position (after deduction of the operations-to-be-settled position) of 170% of the book value equity less administrative fixed assets.
Provisions specific to institutional investors
Insurance companiesLimits (max.) on securities issued by nonresidentsThe share of foreign securities may not exceed 30% of the technical provisions to cover nonpension obligations and required capital.Limits (max.) on investment portfolio held abroadThe share of foreign securities may not exceed 30% of the technical provisions to cover nonpension obligations and required capital.Limits (min.) on investment portfolio held locallyAt least 70% of obligations and required capital must be covered by domestic instruments.Currency-matching regulations on assets/liabilities compositionInsurance companies must match assets with liabilities in each currency.Pension fundsFor foreign currency, the same-day buy and sell ceiling for pension funds is 0.4% of assets or the equivalent of $2 million. However, if 0.4% of assets is less than $1 million, pension funds may trade up to that absolute amount daily. Further, there is a limit on trading the same instrument on the same day of up to 1.5% of the pension fund assets for the previous day.Limits (max.) on investment portfolio held abroadPrivate pension funds are prohibited from investing in securities held abroad.Limits (min.) on investment portfolio held locallyPrivate pension funds must hold a minimum of 30% and a maximum of 60% of total assets in government securities. In the public sector, the type of operation permitted depends on the type of institution. Public institutions are bound by their own by-laws, and the central government and subgovernments use their own procedures, which are more restrictive. Pension funds are authorized to hold up to 60% of their assets in foreign-currencydenominated instruments. With respect to this limit, private issue securities and personal loans to affiliates and social security beneficiaries that are not denominated in foreign currencies are calculated at 1.8% of their value.Currency-matching regulations on assets/liabilities compositionn.a.Investment firms and collective investment fundsRequirements and limits apply on the investment of pension funds in instruments that make up financial trusts.Limits (max.) on securities issued by nonresidentsThe following may not exceed 20% of an investment fund’s assets: (1) deposits or securities issued or guaranteed by a single entity or economic group, (2) securities for which the management agent is a member of the economic group to which the administration company belongs, and (3) deposits and securities issued by entities represented in the country by a member of the economic group to which the administration company belongs (securities issued or guaranteed by the government of Uruguay and securities issued and guaranteed by foreign governments that are rated investor grade are the exception). Securities representing the debt of an investment fund may not exceed 50% of the corresponding amount in circulation. Investment funds may not invest more than 30% of their portfolio in shares issued by a business corporation.Limits (max.) on investment portfolio held abroadn.a.Limits (min.) on investment portfolio held locallyn.a.Currency-matching regulations on assets/liabilities compositionn.a.

Approved goods imported under the Melanesian Spearhead Group Trade Agreement and the PICTA and PACER trade agreements are duty-free. These goods require certificates of origin issued to exporters and importers by the member countries. Effective January 2, 2007, the import duty rates of tariff items have been revised, leading to an increase in all tariffs. Also effective that date, customs duties on goods imported or delivered from bonded houses are exempted, and some amendments have been made for goods imported under an approved development project agreement.
A 35% duty applies to certain imported products in the protected goods category, except for six items covered under the Melanesian Spearhead Group Trade Agreement, to which a 40% duty applies. In addition, a 40% duty, which decreases by 5% a year, is applied to ice cream, fruit juice, meat, and soap, and duties of VT 350 and VT 315 a liter are applied to fuel and paint, respectively.

Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Vietnam is the Vietnamese dong.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationUnitary.Conventional pegged arrangementEffective December 31, 2006, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) quotes the daily average exchange rate against the dollar in the interbank market during the previous business day as the current interbank market rate. Effective January 1, 2007, the SBV widened the dollardong trading band, allowing banks to quote rates that vary up to ±0.5% (previously, ±0.25%) from the rate quoted by the SBV. With respect to other currencies, banks and financial institutions may set their exchange rates at their discretion. The exchange rate has remained very stable with respect to the dollar since August 2004 when the SBV announced that the annual depreciation rate for dong would be limited to 1%. During 2006, the dong depreciated 1.4%.
The SBV has continued implementing an exchange rate flexibility road map, including (1) allowing banks to set the dong-dollar forward rate on the basis of the difference between the dong basic interest rate announced by the SBV and the U.S target interest rate announced by the U.S. Federal Reserve; (2) liberalizing foreign exchange conversion; (3) piloting dong option transactions with negotiated fees (liberalized the indirect exchange rate to be decided by market forces); and (4) piloting foreign exchange trading in cash with negotiated prices.Exchange taxNo.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketThe SBV permits authorized credit institutions to enter into forward and swap transactions between the dong and foreign currency with maturities of 3 to 365 days. The maturities of forward, swap, and options transactions of foreign currencies are negotiated between authorized credit institutions and customers. The dong-dollar forward rate is set on the basis of (1) the spot rate of the day of signing the forward and swap contract, (2) the difference between the dong base interest rate (a year) announced by the SBV and the U.S. target interest rate (announced by the Federal Reserve), and (3) the maturity of the contract. Authorized credit institutions are not permitted to conduct option transactions with economic entities and other organizations and individuals; however, recently, options transactions with negotiated fees were introduced as a pilot.References to legal instruments and	Decision No. 2554/QÐ-NHNN of 31/12/2006. hyperlinks

ClassificationUnitary.Managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rateThe official foreign exchange rate is determined in the interbank market. The market relies on primary dealers as market makers to provide two-way bid/offer prices during business hours, with the spread based on market fundamentals. Effective August 11, 2006, trades are quoted in lots of $500,000 (previously, $50,000). All foreign currency trades are required to pass through the interbank market. The Bank of Zambia (BOZ) intervenes in the market primarily through transactions with the primary dealers but may also transact with market makers (i.e., other banks). The interbank rates provide the basis for determining the BOZ exchange rates: the BOZ’s buying rate is the simple average of the primary dealers’ lowbid rates, and the BOZ’s selling rate is the simple average of the primary dealers’ high-offer rates.Exchange taxNo.Exchange subsidyNo.Forward exchange marketYes.Official cover of forward operationsYes.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.Arrangements for Payments and Receipts

ZIMBABWE
(Position as of February 28, 2007)
Status under IMF Articles of Agreement
Article VIIIDate of acceptance: February 5, 1995.
Exchange MeasuresRestrictions and/or multiple currency practicesThe staff report for the 2005 Article IV consultation with Zimbabwe states that as of August 1, 2005, Zimbabwe maintained restrictions on the making of transfers and payments for current international transactions, and multiple currency practices, inconsistent, respectively, with Article VIII Sections 2(a) and 3 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. Zimbabwe maintains multiple currency practices (MCP) arising from the lack of a mechanism to prevent a divergence of more than 2 percent between (i) the exchange rates in the official and parallel markets, (ii) the exchange rates applicable for private sector imports and government imports, (iii) the exchange rates paid by successful bidders in the same tender, (iv) the exchange rate used for surrender of export receipts, including from international gold sales (weighted average rate from each auction) and the other rates in the exchange market, and (v) the exchange rate applicable to inward remittances of foreign exchange. Zimbabwe also maintains exchange restrictions arising from (i) limitations on the availability of foreign exchange, in the form of priority lists that limit the provision of foreign exchange for certain specified transactions which are subject to the approval of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), and (ii) the existence of private sector external payment arrears inconsistent with Article VIII Section 2(a). (Country Report No. 05/360)International security restrictionsNo.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksn.a.
Exchange ArrangementCurrencyThe currency of Zimbabwe is the Zimbabwe dollar. Effective August 1, 2006, the Zimbabwe dollar was redenominated using a rate of 1:1,000.Exchange rate structure
ClassificationMultiple.Conventional pegged arrangementEffective January 24, 2006, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) introduced the Tradable Foreign Currency Balance System (TFCBS), under which the interbank exchange rate is allowed to depreciate by a daily maximum of (1) 1% if the volume transacted in the market reaches US$5–US$10 million a day; (2) 1.5% if daily transaction volume reaches US$10– US$15 million a day; and (3) 2% if it exceeds US$15 million a day. Under this system, volume is known only to the RBZ, and the RBZ effectively fixes the exchange rate. Because the exchange rate has remained effectively constant since the system was introduced, the exchange rate regime was reclassified effective January 25, 2006, to the category conventional pegged arrangement from the category managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. Also effective that date, all foreign exchange transactions by the government were effected at the rate of Z$30,000 per US$1. Previously, foreign exchange transactions of the government and public enterprises were effected at the rate of Z$26,000 per US$1. All other transactions and inward remittances were subject to the interbank exchange rate. Transactions under these two rates were effected through a carrot-and-stick retention-based export incentive scheme operated by the RBZ. On August 1, 2006, the RBZ redenominated the Zimbabwe dollar at a rate of 1:1,000 and devalued it by 60% vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. Previous banknotes and bearer checks were allowed to be used for three weeks after the redenomination.Effective April 27, 2006, the guaranteed floor exchange rate for inward remittances was changed to the interbank rate. Previously, a floor exchange rate of Z$17,500 per US$1 applied for inward remittances. On August 1, 2006, the RBZ introduced the Exchange Rate Impact Assessment Board (ERIAB) to monitor and inform the market of the sustainable bands of exchange rate adjustments under a “new flexible exchange rate regime. ” However, the board is not operational yet.
The interbank rate has remained fixed so far at Z$250 per US$1 (the new currency).
Exchange tax	No.
Exchange subsidy	An official rate for government imports and debt service with Afreximbank applies at
Z$30 per US$1 (after redenomination). Effective April 27, 2006, public enterprises receive foreign exchange from the RBZ at the prevailing interbank rate. For the 2007 selling season, the new producer price of cotton is Z$500 a kilogram. For the 2006 season, the producer prices of wheat and maize were Z$49,000 a ton and Z$2,000 a ton, respectively.
Forward exchange market	No.

On domestic ownership and/or tradeNo person, either as principal or agent, may deal in or possess gold unless that person is (1) the holder of a license or permit, (2) the holder or distributor of a registered mining location from which gold is being produced, or (3) the employee or agent of any of the persons mentioned in (1) and (2) above and authorized by an employer or principal to deal in or possess gold that is already in the lawful possession of the employer or principal. A mining commissioner may issue to any person a permit authorizing the acquisition, possession, or disposal of any gold, provided the quantity does not exceed one troy ounce. In all other cases, permission may be issued by the Secretary for Mines only.
Under the terms of the Gold Trade Act, three types of licenses may be issued: a gold dealing license, a gold recovery works license, and a gold assaying license. All gold obtained from a registered mining location must be lodged with the holder of its gold dealing license no later than the tenth day of every month unless specific permission has been granted by the mining commissioner or the appropriate minister. Any person intending to smelt gold or any article containing gold must first obtain a license issued by a district commissioner under the terms of the Secondhand Goods Act, which authorizes the possession of smelting equipment. Small-scale gold producers receive a support price of Z$16,000 a gram. The gold support price for large-scale producers was abandoned but they can access the support price for small-scale producers if they choose to be paid in Zimbabwe dollars.On external trade
Controls on exports and imports of banknotes
On exportsThe exportation of gold in unmanufactured form is controlled and licensed by the Ministry of Mines; these controls do not apply to the RBZ. No export licenses for gold are issued.
The importation of gold is controlled by the Gold Trade Act, which requires those intending to import gold into Zimbabwe to meet certain requirements.Domestic currencyEffective February 1, 2007, the limit for the export of local currency in person or baggage by resident travelers is set at Z$100,000 (new currency). Previously, resident travelers could take out up to Z$5,000.Foreign currency
On importsResidents may take out up to the equivalent of US$1,000 a day without Exchange Control approval and may take out up to the equivalent of US$500 a day for business travel and up to US$2,500 a year for holiday travel. Nonresident travelers may take out the traveler’s checks they brought in, less the amount they sold to ADs. On departure, nonresident travelers may reconvert unspent Zimbabwean currency into foreign currencies on presentation of exchange certificates.Domestic currencyYes.Foreign currencyForeign currency and traveler’s checks may be imported without restriction but may be sold or exchanged through ADs only. A declaration of the source is required for amounts exceeding US$2,000.References to legal instruments and hyperlinksExchange Control Act and the Exchange Control Statutory Instruments.
Resident AccountsForeign exchange accounts permittedYes.Held domesticallyResident individuals may open foreign currency accounts (FCAs) in one of the denominated currencies in local branches of ADs. They may also open rand and pula accounts over and above the denominated currencies. Funds withdrawn from FCAs and converted into local currency may not be redeposited in the account, except for the amount of the initial investment and income or capital gains from investments in listed companies on the stockexchange or money market accounts. Effective October 1, 2006, 10% of export earnings are directed toward the Fuel and Electricity Stabilization Fund (FESF), effectively increasing the surrender requirement to 32.5%. Previously, exporters were allowed to retain 75% in FCAs for an indefinite time and 25% was sold to the RBZ at the interbank rate. Tobacco prices are quoted in U.S. dollars at auctions, but producers can retain 15% of the sales in FCAs and receive the rest in the local currency equivalent at the interbank rate. In addition, producers received a 65% top-up bonus for sales until August 31, 2006, on the Tobacco Performance Research and Development Facility (TPRDF). This bonus came on top of the 35% early delivery bonus introduced on April 27, 2006, which was based on the actual value of the tobacco sold on the auction floors. Gold producers are allowed to deposit the same percentage of gold proceeds in FCAs as exporters of other goods and they receive the international price at the interbank rate for the remainder.

10 For three countries, information is not available on the existence of exchange restrictions or MCPs.
11 Information on exchange restrictions and MCPs in the AREAER does not report on whether such exchange restrictions or MCPs have been approved by the IMF.
12 See the Board paper for information, “Article VIII Acceptance by IMF Members—Recent Trends and Implications for the Fund, May 16, 2006,” www.imf.org/external/pp/longres.aspx?id=568.
13 The standard review of the exchange systems of some of these countries was under way in 2006.
14 A member should notify the IMF before imposing such measures. The notifications are immediately circulated to the Board. The member may assume that the IMF has no objection unless the IMF informs the member otherwise within 30 days of the notification. The IMF’s approval of an exchange restriction pursuant to Decision No. 144-(52/51) is granted for an unlimited period of time.
15 The following transactions were exempted from the URR: (1) direct investment, government loans, and investments in immovable assets; (2) foreign loans signed prior to December 19, 2006; (3) sales of foreign exchange agreed to before December 19, 2006; (4) interbank transactions on their own account; (5) foreign currencies sold or exchanged by embassies and international organizations; (6) rollover of hedging swap transactions; (7) foreign currency loans or foreign currencies from the issuance of debt instruments; (8) foreign currencies for the purchase of nonperforming loans or for payments of guarantee obligations under court order; and (9) traveler’s checks and foreign banknotes.
16 Capital controls and prudential measures are highly intertwined owing to the many overlaps in their application. For example, some of the prudential measures (such as application of discriminatory reserve requirements to deposit accounts held by residents and nonresidents) can actually be regarded as c 17Inc

Tobin (“A Proposal for Monetary Reform,” Eastern Economic Journal, Volume IV, No. 3–4, July/October 1978, pp. 153–59), who proposed a small tax on all foreign exchange dealings. He advocated putting “sand in the wheels of international finance” by increasing transaction costs. Because the tax burden increases with the frequen instruments in general are affected only marginally.

20 URRs may also be used to limit capital outflows by making them more sensitive to domestic interest rates. For example, a 100% URR imposed on banks for capital outflows und minus the interest income derived from the foreign currency transaction.
