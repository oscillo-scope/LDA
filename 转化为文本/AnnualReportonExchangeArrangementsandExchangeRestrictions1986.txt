Introduction The period covered by this Report is 1985 and, for major developments, the first quarter of 1986. The Report draws on information available to the Fund from a number of sources, including that provided in the course of consultation visits to member countries, and it has been prepared in close collaboration with national authorities. The International Monetary Fund's Articles of Agreement provide for notification by member countries to the Fund of a comprehensive description of their exchange controls and exchange rate arrangements, and changes in these as they occur. Measures intensifying members' restrictions on imports are also monitored by the Fund in the context of its function of surveillance over exchange rate policies of members. The Report centers on exchange arrangements and exchange restrictions, but it is also more comprehensive in that it presents other external economic policy measures and intergovernmental arrangements that may have direct balance of payments implications. As in previous Reports, in the descriptions of members' systems, questions of definition and jurisdiction have not been raised; the description in the Report of a restrictive practice by a member does not mean that it is or is not being maintained consistently with the Fund's Articles, or that, if subject to Article VIII, it has or has not been approved by the Fund. Global Environment Growth of world output and trade moderated in 1985 to just under 2.8 percent following a strong recovery in 1984 that had emanated largely from the United States. Although the slowing of trade was more pronounced than that of output, the cyclical relationship between the two variables conformed to the pattern registered in 1977 and 1980, when a deceleration of activity also occurred (Chart 1). The shift in the economic performance of the industrial country group was generally favor- able, as inflation rates declined in most countries, and the external current account of the group improved substantially. Inflation, as measured by the composite GNP deflator, was the lowest since 1967. Unemployment continued to be a major problem, however, not showing any decline from the peak level of 8.2 percent of the industrial country labor force reached in 1982. Trade imbal- ances also widened, as the deficit of the United States and the surplus of Japan rose to record levels. Economic performance in the group of non-oil developing countries was mixed, but overall it showed some encouraging signs. Growth in this group of countries was only slightly slower than in 1984, and the volume of exports showed a moder- ate gain, despite the sluggishness of markets in the industrial countries and protectionism, which con- tinued to impede access of manufactures and agricultural products to those markets. The current account deficit of this group of countries narrowed further, and external payments arrears dropped sharply for the first time in seven years, largely as a result of improved relations with creditors that made possible the successful conclusion of re- scheduling negotiations. Inflation remained at a high level in many developing countries, and the 3 ©International Monetary Fund.

The reduced purchasing power of exports was particularly evident in the group of oil-exporting developing countries, resulting from a sharp decline in oil prices and the continuing sluggishness of the volume of oil exports occasioned by energy conser- vation and the development of alternative sources of supply in the industrial countries. GDP growth in the oil-exporting developing countries, neverthe- less, was largely sustained in 1985. Despite the easing of international interest rates, as reflected in the decline in the six-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) from on average 11.3 percent in 1984 to 8.6 percent in 1985, and the deceleration in the growth of external debt, the debt service burden of many developing countries rose in 1985, owing to the decline in export earnings. Manufactured exports of the developing countries continued to be adversely affected by protection- ism, mainly in the form of quantitative restrictions. Price support policies of the industrial countries led to oversupply of a number of agricultural commodities and exerted a depressing influence on their world prices, creating additional trade bar- riers for countries that export these agricultural commodities. Exchange Rate Arrangements A salient feature of exchange rate developments in 1985 was the weakening of the U .S. dollar, following four consecutive years of appreciation. As a result, the currencies of most of the other major industrial countries appreciated against the U.S. dollar and in nominal effective terms. The depreciation of the U .S. dollar amounted to almost 20 percent in nominal effective terms during the period March 1985 to January 1986. Over this period, short-term interest rate differentials moved substantially against U .S. doliar-denominated as- sets, monetary aggregates grew rapidly in the United States while they were tightened in a number of other industrial countries, and there was a slowdown of real economic growth in the United States, while on average, the rate of growth changed little in other large industrial countries. At a meeting on September 22, 1985, finance ministers and central bank governors of the G-5 countries (France, the Federal Republic of Ger- many, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States) agreed that since the current levels did not appear to fully reflect policy commitments and changes in underlying economic conditions, a further appreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies against the dollar would be desirable. Accordingly, the G-5 countries, in coordination with a number of the other industrial countries, intervened in foreign exchange markets toward that end. This concerted action was in contrast to the trend of recent years noted in earlier Reports toward reduced overall reliance on interventions in the foreign exchange markets but followed from intentions declared initially at the Williamsburg summit. In June 1985 the Committee of Central Bank Governors of the European Economic Community (EEC) adopted a number of measures to strengthen the workings of the European Monetary System (EMS). A realign- ment was undertaken in July when the Italian lira was devalued against the European Currency Unit (ECU). Developing countries continued to use greater flexibility in the arrangements for determining their exchange rates in 1985. The trend away from single currency pegs continued, as four countries changed from U .S. dollar pegs or quasi-pegs to managed floating or to composite currency pegs. The major development among developing countries noted in the previous Report—adoption of independently market-determined floating arrangements—con- tinued. In 1985 three developing countries (Bolivia, Dominican Republic, and Zambia) and one indus- trial country (New Zealand) adopted arrangements by which their exchange rates were essentially determined by market forces. As a result of these changes, the three broad groupings of exchange rate arrangements (single currency pegs, composite ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INTRODUCTION currency pegs, and more flexible arrangements) now apply to approximately equal proportions of the Fund membership. In contrast to 1984, developing countries gener- ally showed a greater willingness to adjust ex- change rates to strengthen balance of payments positions. As a consequence, real exchange rates of developing countries depreciated by about 13 per- cent on a weighted average basis during 1985. This movement was assisted by the effective deprecia- tion of the U .S. dollar, which remains the key reference currency or peg for many developing countries. During 1985 the average unweighted exchange rate of currencies with pegged arrange- ments depreciated in terms of the foreign currency to which the domestic currency was pegged by 20 percent in nominal terms, with rates of deprecia- tion ranging from 4 percent for the Egyptian pound to 60 percent for the Laotian kip. For members with flexible arrangements, the average (unweighted) nominal depreciation amounted to 31 percent, ranging from zero for the Salvadoran colon to nearly 100 percent for the Bolivian peso. The exchange rates of several countries appreciated during 1985, although by a relatively small amount. Commercial and Exchange Policy Developments Protectionist pressures for trade restrictions con- tinued unabated in 1985. Exchange restrictions were intensified significantly in a few countries in response to these pressures, but overall these actions were more than counterbalanced by liberal- izing actions, particularly those affecting capital transactions. The concern that protectionist pres- sures might lead to widespread and retaliatory restrictive actions and weaken the international system prompted some industrial countries to adopt liberalizing measures, or at least to curb the extent of restrictive measures. Japan announced a program to remove various barriers to imports in the face of a rising current account surplus. The export re- straint agreement between the United States and Japan for limiting imports of motor vehicles into the United States was not renewed in 1985, although Japan unilaterally decided to limit exports to the United States at a higher level. Recourse to retalia- tory trade measures was limited in scope in 1985, but pressures for such actions grew more intense in early 1986. The United States, in retaliation for an extension of the European Communities' (EC) preferential tariff treatment of citrus fruit imports from certain Mediterranean countries, sharply in- creased duties on pasta products imported from the EC. In response, the EC raised its tariffs on walnut and lemon imports from the United States. There were few changes in the import restrictions applied by industrial countries to agricultural prod- ucts, but a number of actions that were taken, mainly in the area of meat products and sugar, had restrictive effects. In the steel sector, the United States signed new bilateral agreements with the EC and Japan that provided for quantitative limits on exports of certain types of steel products to the United States. A number of new bilateral agree- ments involving textiles trade were concluded, and existing ones renewed; these changes were on balance in the direction of increased restrictiveness, although there was some relaxation of restrictions. Protectionist pressures were moderated by the accelerated implementation by several industrial countries of tariff cuts agreed under the Tokyo Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations and the extension of the General Scheme of Preferences (GSP) for the developing countries. Despite balance of payments pressures, a number of developing countries reduced the scope of import restrictions and simplified import regimes. Several of these liberalization programs were implemented in the context of exchange reforms that involved the adoption of floating exchange rate regimes. Coun- tertrade arrangements as a means of balancing bilateral trade and of promoting and maintaining export markets continued to play an important role in the commercial policies of many countries, both industrial and developing. As in past years, it is not possible to estimate the magnitude of annual trade conducted under these arrangements, but in view of the increase in the number of new arrangements concluded during the year, their relative importance in world trade would seem to have increased. There were very few modifications in either quantitative restrictions or licensing requirements affecting exports by the industrial countries. A large number of developing countries, however, introduced export promotion measures aimed at supporting their balance of payments. These mea- sures included increased financial incentives, lower export taxes, and more liberal foreign exchange surrender requirements. In a number of developing as well as industrial countries, exchange guarantee and export credit facilities were introduced, with the aim of providing budgetary support for exports. Exchange restrictions on current invisibles appli- cable to residents and nonresidents, mainly admin- istered by developing countries, were on balance 5 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS relaxed in 1985. A more serious form of exchange restriction on current payments, i .e ., restrictions giving rise to external payments arrears, continued to be maintained by a large number of developing countries. The number of countries with payments arrears remained unchanged, but the level of total outstanding payments arrears declined substan- tially, as a number of countries with relatively large arrears successfully restructured the outstanding amount in the course of multilateral debt resched- uling and/or refinancing. In 1985 the total exter- nal debt obligations restructured amounted to SDR 13 billion, slightly more than one half of the total in 1984. Reliance on multiple currency practices by the developing countries decreased in 1985, continuing the trend begun in 1984. The declining trend in 1985, however, was more significant than the change in the total number of countries maintaining such practices signifies, because a number of multiple currency practices introduced in 1985, which were operating as transitional measures, involved dual exchange market systems that led to a more realistic exchange rate for most transactions. The trend toward liberalization of international capital transfers continued in 1985 and was evident in both industrial and developing countries. The liberalization of exchange controls in several indus- trial countries was undertaken in conjunction with deregulation of domestic banking, broadening of financial markets, and changes in the tax treatment of capital transactions. These developments pro- moted competition and increased the integration in international capital markets, as well as contribut- ing to liberalization in the regulations governing foreign exchange transfers. A number of devel- oping countries also introduced financial sector reforms aimed at developing financial markets through the expansion of foreign participation in the domestic market and the easing of residents' access to foreign capital markets. Liberalization in some of these countries was facilitated by the adoption of flexible exchange rate systems, which reduced the incentives for capital flows through illegal parallel markets. Regulations on portfolio and direct invest- ment were also liberalized in several industrial and developing countries, although liberalization to promote direct investment in developing countries proceeded at a slower pace than in 1984. In 1985 the total Fund membership increased to 149, as one country, Tonga, joined the Fund (September 13, 1985). No new acceptances of the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement were made during the year. As of end-March 1986, the number of countries that have accepted the Article VIII obliga- tions was 60, and 89 countries were availing themselves of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV, Section 2. All members have notified the Fund of their decision regarding Article VIII or XIV status. Twenty-eight countries availing them- selves of the transitional arrangements under Arti- cle XIV maintain exchange systems that are free or virtually free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. Twelve of these countries are members of the West African Monetary Union or the Central African Monetary Area. II. Main Developments in Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Rates Fund members are required to notify the Fund of changes in their arrangements for determining their exchange rates, in accordance with members' obli- gations under Article IV, Section 2(a), of the Articles of Agreement. Surveillance of exchange arrangements of members by the Fund, as required under Article IV, Section 3, is conducted in the context of regular consultations with members and during the intervening period between consulta- tions, as changes in such arrangements are assessed by the staff and communicated to the Executive Board. Under the provisions of Article IV, Fund members have the right to maintain exchange arrangements of their choice; members also have certain obligations regarding the communication of these arrangements to the Fund. To facilitate the implementation of the Fund's surveillance over exchange rate policies, members' exchange ar- rangements may be classified under three broad groupings, as follows: (1) pegged arrangements, comprising currencies that are pegged either to another currency or to a currency composite, including the SDR, and currencies that display limited flexibility against another currency (quasi- pegs); (2) a middle group of managed flexibility, comprising currencies whose values are adjusted according to a set of indicators other than partner country exchange rates alone, or are maintained 6 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RATES under a system of managed floating; and (3) "inde- pendently" floating (essentially market-determined) arrangements, including cooperative arrangements in the European Monetary System, and indepen- dently floating regimes. The basic rationale for the classification of members' exchange arrangements is the extent and form of the flexibility that these arrangements permit, and this criterion is also applied to subcategorize each of these broad group- ings in Table 1. In 1985, 59 changes in exchange arrangements occurred and were communicated by members to the Fund, including measures that resulted in a reclassification of the basic type of arrangement, all discrete adjustments in exchange rates, and a number of changes in the form of composite pegs. In addition, developments in members' effective (trade-weighted) exchange rates are also monitored continually on the basis of available data to facili- tate the symmetry of treatment of pegged and flexible exchange rates; the Executive Board is notified of changes in excess of 10 percent on a "real" inflation-adjusted basis when they occur. Thirty such notifications of changes in real ef- fective rates since the preceding consultation with the member (or previous notification) were made in 1985.l This compares with 19 such no t if i- cations in 1984, and 6 in 1983 when the system was introduced. Five of a total of twelve reclassifications of arrangements in 1985 were in the direction of greater flexibility. A major new development in this period was the adoption of independently floating exchange rates by developing and smaller industrial countries. Three developing countries (Bolivia, Dominican Republic, and Zambia) and one indus- trial country (New Zealand) introduced exchange arrangements by which their exchange rates are essentially determined by market forces. Uganda, on the other hand, ceased to maintain a freely floating system. At the end of 1985, independently floating exchange rates were therefore maintained by nine developing country members: Bolivia, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Lebanon, Philip- pines, South Africa, Uruguay, Zaire, and Zambia. In addition, four other countries adopted more flexible arrangements, moving from a peg or quasi- peg to the U .S. dollar to a currency composite peg 1 Australia, Bo l iv ia, Bu rund i, Cape Verde, Dominican Re- public, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Mexico, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Sierra Leone, South A f r ica, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, United Kingdom, United States, U ruguay, Venezuela. More than one notification was made in a number of these countries. (Maldives, Sierra Leone, and Sudan), and to a managed float (El Salvador). Only two members moved to reduced flexibility. Peru changed from adjusting the exchange rate on the basis of specific indicators to a U .S. dollar peg, and Uganda ceased floating independently and began to manage the rate. Two changes did not involve a shift in the flexibility of the arrangements. Equatorial Guinea moved from the category "Pegged: Other Single Currency" to the category "Pegged: French Franc;" and Ghana moved away from the category "Flexi- bility Limited vis-a-vis a Single Currency" to the category "Pegged: U .S. dollar." In addition to these changes, a new member informed the Fund in 1985 of its exchange arrangements: Tonga has been classified within the group of countries whose currencies are pegged to a single currency (the Australian dollar). At the end of 1985, 98 (101) members had pegged or quasi-pegged exchange arrangements, 25 (26) members had managed flexi- bility, and the remaining 25 (20) members had arrangements under which most or all of their currency relationships were independently floating (including EMS currencies).2 (Positions as of end- 1984 are shown in parentheses.) From the inception of the present classification system in December 1981 to December 1985, the proportion of Fund members with "More Flexible" arrangements and those members maintaining a cooperative arrangement under the EMS rose from 28 percent to 33 percent; those with single currency pegs and "Flexibility Limited vis-a-vis a Single Currency" arrangements declined from 47 percent to 37 percent, and those with both currency composite arrangements increased from 25 percent to 30 percent (although the use of the SDR peg declined somewhat). Developments Affecting the Classification of Exchange Arrangements In 1985, 12 members notified the Fund of changes in their exchange arrangements that in- volved a reclassification. Eight countries instituted changes in their ex- change arrangements that resulted in increased flexibility. On August 29, 1985 the Government of Bolivia announced that the previous fixed exchange rate relationship between the Bolivian peso and the U .S. dollar was replaced by a system of foreign 2Excluding the arrangements of Democratic Kampuchea, for which information is not available. 7 ©International Monetary Fund.

The official exchange rate is equivalent to the weighted average of the exchange rates resulting from actual sales of foreign exchange during the auctions. Under the new system, the official exchange rate applies to all foreign exchange operations in Bolivia. The first auction took place on September 2, 1985, and established an exchange rate of $b 1,150,000 = US$1, representing a depreciation of the Bolivian peso of 93.5 percent in terms of the U .S. dollar from the previous official selling rate of $b 75,000 = US$1. The introduction of a floating exchange rate by Bolivia was accompanied by the elimination of exchange and trade restrictions, with the exception of external payments arrears. The exchange arrangements of Bolivia were thus reclassified from the category "Pegged: U .S. Dol- lar" to the category "More Flexible: Independently Floating." The authorities of the Dominican Republic in- formed the Fund that with effect from January 23, 1985, the previous dual exchange markets were un if ied, and all foreign exchange transactions now take place at market-determined exchange rates. Exceptions are transitional arrangements for foreign exchange transactions for which the peso counter- part had already been deposited with the Central Bank, and transitional arrangements for certain other transactions that had already been authorized by the Monetary Board. The authorities also an- nounced that the Central Bank does not intend to intervene in the foreign exchange market to in- fluence the exchange rate. The exchange arrange- ments of the Dominican Republic were thus re- classified from the category "Pegged: U .S. Dollar" to the category "More Flexible: Independently Floating." The authorities of El Salvador informed the Fund that with effect from June 17, 1985, a number of categories of transactions have been transferred from the official to the parallel market, resulting in an effective depreciation of the colon. As a result of this change, the majority of external transactions are now conducted in the parallel market. El Salvador was thus reclassified from the category "Pegged: U .S. Dollar" to the category "More Flexible: Managed Floating." The authorities of Maldives notified the Fund that with effect from July 1, 1985, the Maldivian rufiyaa, which was previously maintained with limited flexibility vis-a-vis the U .S. dollar, was linked to a trade-weighted basket of currencies. Under the new system, the mid-point rufiyaa/ U .S. dollar exchange rate was set initially at the previous level of Rf 7.10 = US$1, but the pre- scribed spread between the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar was increased from 0.7 percent to 1.4 percent, in terms of the buying rate. Buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar on Ju ly 1 were Rf 7.05 = US$1 and Rf 7.15 = US$1, respec- tively. The exchange arrangements of Maldives were thus reclassified from the category "Flexibility Limited vis-a-vis a Single Currency" to the cate- gory "Pegged: Currency Composite." The New Zealand authorities informed the Fund that, with effect from March 4, 1985, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand ceased quoting buying and selling rates for the New Zealand dollar against foreign currencies, allowing the exchange rate to be determined by market forces. The Reserve Bank monitors market trends and developments, and has the option to intervene in the market to smooth out exchange rate fluctuations in periods of disturbed conditions. Prior to the adoption of the float, the New Zealand authorities had relaxed a number of exchange controls affecting capital flows late in 1984. The exchange arrangements of New Zealand were thus reclassified within the "More Flexible" category from "Managed Floating" to "Indepen- dently Floating." The Central Bank of Sierra Leone notified the Fund that with effect from February 21, 1985, the official exchange rate for the leone was devalued to Le 6 = US$1 from Le 2.5 = US$1, representing a 58.3 percent depreciation with respect to the U .S. dollar. At the same time, the peg for the leone was changed from the U .S. dollar to the SDR, with the Bank of Sierra Leone issuing daily equivalent exchange rates for the leone in terms of all ma- jor currencies. Since September 1984, limited allocations of foreign exchange for private sector payments had been made under an arrangement whereby a newly formed company, the Precious Minerals Marketing Company (PMMC), accepted applications for foreign exchange at buying and selling rates differing from the official rate. The effective supply price for foreign exchange to the company was close to the parallel market rate, which, in January 1985, was about Le 9 per U .S. dollar, whereas the company sold foreign exchange at exchange rates of Le 5.0 to Le 6.0 = US$1 —with the PMMC recompensed by the Gov- ernment for the differences between the buying and selling rates. Other channels of the foreign ex- change proceeds of Sierra Leone were the required surrender of foreign exchange to the Central Bank for official uses (including payments for imports of 9 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS oil and debt servicing), a very small amount of surrender to commercial banks, retention allow- ances for own use by certain exporters, and an extensive parallel market. The exchange ar- rangements of Sierra Leone were thus reclassified from the category "Pegged: U .S. Dollar" to the category "Pegged: Currency Composite." The authorities of Sudan informed the Fund that with effect from August 19, 1985, the official exchange rate for the Sudanese pound was pegged to a composite of major currencies, terminating a fixed relationship with the U .S. dollar. The official exchange rate declared by the Bank of Sudan on August 19 was LSd 2.475 = US$1. Thereafter, the Bank of Sudan announced a revised U .S. dollar/ Sudanese pound rate on a weekly basis, while cross rates for other major currencies were announced on a daily basis, as was the previous practice. The exchange arrangements of Sudan were thus reclassified from the category "Pegged: U .S. Dol- lar" to the category "Pegged: Currency Compos- ite." The basket pegging arrangement was, in practice, discontinued in September and replaced by a system of discretionary adjustments; however, the rate had remained unchanged at LSd 2.504 = US$1 since September 23. Zambia notified the Fund that, with effect from October 4, 1985, the exchange rate of the kwacha is being determined by a weekly foreign exchange auction, under which all exchange transactions are to take place, and the system of determining the kwacha rate on the basis of a basket of currencies had been discontinued. The auction-determined rate applies to all foreign exchange transactions, al- though as a transitional arrangement expatriate remittances were effected at the pre-auction rate of K 2.2 per U .S. dollar during the period October 4 to December 31, 1985. The first rate under the new exchange rate system announced on October 11, 1985 was K 5.01 = US$1, representing a deprecia- tion of 56.1 percent in terms of the U .S. dollar. In the interim, the authorities suspended dealings in foreign exchange between the Bank of Zambia and Zambian-based authorized dealers. Zambia was thus reclassified from the category "Pegged: Cur- rency Composite" to the category "More Flexible: Independently Floating." Two countries instituted changes in their ex- change arrangements resulting in no change in the degree of flexibility. In Equatorial Guinea, the ekwele was withdrawn from circulation on January 1, 1985, and was replaced by the CFA franc issued by the Bank of Central African States, at the rate of Bipk. 4 for one 10 CFA franc. The CFA franc is in turn pegged to the French franc at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F0.02. The exchange arrangements of Equatorial Guinea were thus reclassified from the category "Pegged: Other Currency" to the category "Pegged: French franc." The authorities of Ghana informed the Fund that, with effect from April 19, 1985, the exchange rate of the cedi was adjusted from <£ 50 = US$1 to <£ 53 = US$1, representing a 5.7 percent devalua- tion against the U .S. dollar. The authorities indi- cated their intention to continue to adjust the exchange rate against the U .S. dollar periodically during 1985. The exchange arrangements of Ghana were therefore reclassified from the category "Lim- ited Flexibility vis-a-vis a Single Currency" to the category "Pegged: U .S. Dollar." Two countries instituted changes in their ex- change arrangements, which resulted in reduced flexibility. Peru informed the Fund that, with effect from August 1, 1985, the Peruvian authorities depre- ciated the sol and fixed the exchange rate in terms of the U .S. dollar. On that date, the exchange rate of the sol in the primary market was changed from S/. 12,449.05 = US$1 to S/. 13,942.77 = US$1 on a mid-point basis, representing a depreciation of 10.7 percent in terms of the U .S. dollar. Also with effect from August 1, 1985, the convertibility into foreign currency of all U .S. dollar-denominated deposits with Peruvian banks was suspended for a period of 90 days; the bulk of these deposits, which accounted for some three fifths of the banking system's liabilities to the private sector, consisted of negotiable certificates of deposit; before Au- gust 1, 1985, there had been an active market for these certificates of deposit (the certificates mar- ket), in which U .S. dollars could be acquired freely at market-determined premiums. During the sus- pension period, which was subsequently extended through April 30, 1986, holders of U .S. dollar- denominated deposits were permitted to convert them into soles at an exchange rate equivalent to that prevailing in the primary market plus a pre- mium of 3 percent to use them and to make any payments abroad authorized to be made through the primary market, or to use them at their maturity to open new U .S. dollar certificates of deposit. Trad- ing of these certificates between private parties was not restricted, nor was the suspension of converti- bility applicable to diplomatic missions, interna- tional organizations, or their staffs. A free market was also established temporarily to handle transac- tions not eligible for foreign exchange from the ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RATES primary market, essentially capital transactions and current invisible payments, and which heretofore had been channeled through the certificates market. On August 9, 1985 the Central Reserve Bank of Peru announced that it had decided to buy foreign exchange purchased by financial institutions in the free exchange market at S/. 17,500 = US$1. The exchange arrangements of Peru were thus reclassi- fied from the category "More Flexible: Adjusted According to a Set of Indicators" to the category "Pegged: U .S. Dollar." Following the unification of the exchange rate system in June 1984, all foreign exchange transac- tions in Uganda have been taking place at an exchange rate determined in the weekly auctions held by the Bank of Uganda. Between November 1984 and September 1985, the rate remained unchanged because of administrative actions. Since then, although there has been some movement, the rates have not reflected underlying market condi- tions, owing to official restrictions on the bidding process. As a result, the exchange arrangements of Uganda have been reclassified from the category "More Flexible: Independently Floating" to the category "More Flexible: Managed Floating." After becoming a member of the Fund on September 13, 1985, the authorities of Tonga communicated to the Fund that the currency of Tonga is the pa'anga, which is pegged to the Australian dollar, the intervention currency, at T$l = A$ l. Tonga was thus classified with the group of countries whose currencies are pegged to a single currency other than the U .S. dollar. Developments in Exchange Rates of Industrial Countries An adjustment of central rates within the Euro- pean Monetary System was implemented on July 22, 1985. The central rates of the Irish pound, the French franc, the Danish krone, the Netherlands guilder, the deutsche mark, the Belgian franc, and the Luxembourg franc were raised by 2 percent, while that of the Italian lira was lowered by 6 percent. These changes involved a depreciation of 7.8 percent in the bilateral central rates of the Italian lira in terms of each of the other EMS currencies (a depreciation of 8.5 percent expressed as lira per foreign currency unit). All other bilateral central rates remained unchanged from the previous alignment. The new rates in terms of the ECU— which includes the pound sterling and the Greek drachma along with the currencies participating in the EMS exchange rate mechanism —are calculated taking into account notional central rates for the pound sterling and the Greek drachma; these were set on the basis of market levels for these currencies on July 19. Given the relatively large weight of the pound sterling in the ECU basket, the central rates of the currencies in the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS, other than the Italian lira, appreciated by only 0.2 percent in terms of the ECU, while the central rate of the Italian lira depreciated by 7.7 percent in terms of the ECU. The central rate against the ECU was set at Lit 1,520.60. The U .S. dollar continued to appreciate through to a peak in February 1985, and then depreciated by some 7 percent before leveling off in Ju ly and August. On September 22 the G-5 countries (France, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, United Kingdom, and United States) declared, inter alia, that exchange rates should better reflect funda- mental economic conditions and that further mea- sures aimed at opening up markets would be important in resisting protectionism. The G-5 agreed that some further orderly appreciation of the main nondollar currencies against the U .S. dollar would be desirable and expressed their readiness to cooperate more closely to encourage such a devel- opment when to do so would be helpful. Im- mediately following this announcement, the ex- change value of the U .S. dollar fell by 5.8 per- cent in effective multilateral exchange rate model (MERM) terms. After the sharp drop in the value of the U .S. dollar in the week following the announce- ment of September 22, the U .S. dollar generally continued to depreciate, albeit at a more moderate pace. Throughout 1985 only two of the industrial countries' currencies depreciated against the U .S. dollar: the Australian dollar (17.7 percent), and the Canadian dollar (5.4 percent) (Table 2) .3 The Netherlands guilder had the largest appreciation against the U .S. dollar in 1985 (28 percent on an end-year basis), while the New Zealand dollar had the smallest appreciation (4.4 percent). As in 1984, there were sizable movements in the nominal effective exchange rates of the currencies of most industrial countries in 1985. In effective (MERM) end-of-year terms, the largest exchange rate appreciation was that of the Japanese yen (13.3 percent). Other appreciations ranged from 10.3 percent (Ireland) to 4.5 percent (Belgium/ 3Based on the Fund's multilateral exchange rate model (MERM), in which the implicit weighting structure takes account of the relative importance of the coun try's trading partners in its direct bilateral relationships w i th them, competi- tive relationships with "third" countries in particular markets, and estimated elasticities affecting trade flows. 11 ©International Monetary Fund.

The rate had depreciated to US$1 = LSd 3.48 as of March 31, 1985. 9Rate applies to all transactions except imports of essential food items, drugs, certain agricultural imports, and school books. 10The new dong, with a value equal to 10 percent of the old dong, was issued by the State Bank on the same date. 13 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS currencies were pegged to the U .S. dollar, seven countries implemented changes in their exchange arrangements or in their exchange rates during the period under review. The authorities of Egypt informed the Fund that measures were taken with effect from January 5, 1985, aimed mainly at merging the free market into the fixed rate commercial bank pool; purchases and sales of foreign exchange for a large portion of private sector transactions that previously took place at rates freely negotiated between private nonbank entities were now required to be effected by the authorized banks at a premium exchange rate set by a newly instituted committee. The free market is now accessible only for invisible transac- tions by the private sector and, on a transitional basis, for private imports utilizing own exchange. The committee meets daily for the purpose of deciding, on the basis of market conditions and economic policies, the value of the premium to be applied to the official commercial bank pool ex- change rate of LE 0.83168 = US$1 (buying). On the first day of operation of the new system, the premium was set at 49.1 percent in local currency terms, resulting in a premium buying rate of LE 1.245 = US$1. This compared with a premium buying rate in effect on the previous day of LE 1.20 = US$1, and a free market rate of about LE 1.35 = US$1. Accompanying changes in the utilization of foreign exchange by exporters and the prohibition of the use of free accounts by private importers resulted in an appreciation of the ex- change rate for private traders. Despite the adjust- ment of the premium rate, the measures are es- timated to have led on average to a further small appreciation of the overall effective exchange rate of the Egyptian pound. With effect from August 12, the Ghanaian cedi was devalued by 7.0 percent in terms of the U .S. dollar, from # 53 = US$1 to C 57 - US$1. A further adjustment from <£ 57 = US$1 to (? 60 = US$1, with effect from October 7, brought the cumulative devaluation since the end of 1984 to 16.7 percent. In July the authorities of the Lao People's Democratic Republic introduced a new rate of KN 300 = US$1 for purchases of foreign exchange by authorized trading companies, while the special exchange rate applicable to private inward remit- tances was changed from KN 108 = US$1 to KN 270 = US$1. The authorities of Nicaragua informed the Fund that a new exchange system, which incorporates a reduction in the number of multiple exchange rates 14 and has resulted in an effective devaluation of the Nicaraguan cordoba, was introduced with effect from February 8, 1985. Under the former exchange system in effect at the end of 1984, the official exchange market comprised three basic exchange rates ranging from C$10 to C$28 per US$1, and there were also a number of mixing rates and an exchange tax. The new exchange system involves the following rates: (1) an exchange rate of C$10 per US$1 applies to interest and principal payments on external loans disbursed up to February 8, 1985; (2) an exchange rate of C$20 per US$1 applies to the provisions of foreign exchange for imports of raw materials, spare parts, and certain essential consumer goods; (3) an exchange rate of C$28 per US$1 applies to imports of petroleum products and certain nonessential consumer goods, to all export proceeds, and to receipts from freight, insurance, port services, investment income, and expenditures by foreign embassies; (4) an exchange rate of C$40 per US$1 applies for imports of many capital goods; (5) an exchange rate of C$50 per US$1 applies to payments for business and official travel, educational expenses abroad, medical expenses abroad, and certain invisible transactions, and to exports of printed materials, international com- munication services, and foreign grants; and (6) a legal free exchange market determines the rates that apply to tourism, private remittances, and other invisibles not subject to the fixed exchange rates. (This exchange market began operation in May .) The Central Bank of Paraguay advised the Fund that, with effect from February 18, 1985, the former exchange rate system, whereby Paraguay had three basic exchange rates, has been changed to a system involving four basic rates. The system of minimum export prices denominated in U .S. dol- lars (aforos) was also reintroduced as the basis of surrender and conversion of all export proceeds. The four basic rates are: (1) 0 160 per US$1 for public sector capital and external debt service payments; (2) 0 240 per US$1 for 50 percent of receipts from exports valued at minimum prices, for registered private capital transactions, for imports of petroleum and agricultural and industrial inputs, and for the transactions of the binational entities; (3) 0 400 per US$1 for the remaining 50 percent of export proceeds based on minimum export prices; and (4) a free market exchange rate for all other imports, profit remittances, and service payments. The authorities of Trinidad and Tobago notified the Fund that, with effect from December 18, the exchange rate of the Trinidad and Tobago dol- lar was adjusted from TT$2.40 = US$1 to ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RATES TT$3.60 = US$1 for most transactions. The previ- ous exchange rate continues to apply to imports of essential food items, drugs, certain agricultural imports, and school books. Since imports eligible for the TT$2.40 per U .S. dollar exchange rate are estimated to account for less than one fourth of total imports, the average depreciation of the Trinidad and Tobago dollar was about 30 percent for merchandise transactions. The Yemen Arab Republic changed the midpoint exchange rate of the Yemeni rial against the U .S. dollar on February 11, from YRls 5.86 = US$1 to YRls 6.4850 = US$1, representing a 9.6 percent depreciation. Among those members with currencies pegged to a currency other than the U .S. dollar or the French franc, Lesotho implemented a change in its ex- change arrangement. In conjunction with the mea- sures taken by South Africa, the authorities of Lesotho reintroduced the dual exchange rate ("fi- nancial rand") system that had been discontinued in February 1983. The Central Bank of Lesotho noted that the loti continues to be equal in value to the South African rand. Lesotho forms part of the Rand Monetary Area. Among those members whose currencies are pegged to the SDR, four countries implemented changes in their exchange rates or exchange arrangements. In Guinea the rate of GS 36 = FF1 was set for sales to the banking system of foreign exchange originating from specified operations, effective October 7. In the official foreign exchange market the syli is pegged to the SDR at the rate of GS 24.6853 = SDR 1; on the basis of this relationship, the value of the syli in the official market vis-a-vis the French franc on October 7 was GS 2.879 = FF 1. Specified operations conducted through the newly created secondary market in- clude export receipts other than those originating from mining exports, capital inflows for investment and transfers from abroad (including grants), and expenditures for tourist and business travel pur- poses. The creation of the new market is intended to be part of a process aimed at bringing the Guinean exchange rate to a more realistic level. Kenya adjusted the exchange rate of the shilling against the SDR on March 29, from a rate of K Sh 15.187159 = SDR 1 to K Sh 15.896735 on April 30, to K Sh 15.976 = SDR 1 on June 28, to K Sh 16.148906 = SDR 1, and again on August 16 to K Sh 17.737761 = SDR 1, representing a gradual cumulative depreciation of 15.1 percent against the SDR since the March 29 modification. With effect from April 1, Vanuatu devalued the vatu by 8.5 percent against the SDR, to which it is pegged. The new midpoint rate of the vatu is VT 110.00 = SDR 1, compared with the previous rate of VT 100.60 - SDR 1. The State Bank of Viet Nam has been authorized, with effect from September 14, to issue new dong and to withdraw old dong from circulation. The new dong has a value equal to ten of the old dong. In addition, with effect from September 15, the exchange rate of the new dong against the U .S. dol- lar has been adjusted to D 15 = US$1; the official exchange rate of the old dong was D 12.06 = US$1. Among those members with currencies "Pegged to a Currency Composite other than the SDR," ten countries implemented changes in their exchange rates or exchange arrangements during 1985. Botswana devalued the pula, which is pegged to a basket composed of SDRs and South African rand, by approximately 15 percent with effect from the close of business on January 9. At the same time, the weight of the rand in the pula basket was increased from 50 to 75 percent. On January 20, 1986 the weight of the rand in the basket was reduced from 75 to 65 percent, and that of the SDR was correspondingly raised to 35 percent; but the exchange rate of the pu la remained virtually unchanged on that date. On January 1 the People's Republic of China discontinued the use of the internal settlement rate, which had been used for all foreign trade and related transactions. Consequently, the official ex- change rate for the renminbi now applies to all foreign exchange transactions. The internal set- tlement rate was Y 2.8 = US$1 until January 1, and on January 2 the representative rate for the ren- minbi communicated to the Fund was Y 2.8097 = US$1. With effect from January 3, 1985, the National Bank of Hungary has been quoting the official exchange rates of foreign currencies five times per week, as against the previous once a week, except rates for notes and checks. Madagascar devalued the franc on a number of occasions in 1985, for a cumulative movement of 15.9 percent against the currency composite to which it is pegged. Malawi devalued the kwacha on April 1 by 15 percent against the currency composite to which it is pegged. Measured against the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, the rate was adjusted from MK 1.5359 - US$1 at the end of March to MK 1.7963 = US$1 on April 2, representing a 14.5 percent devaluation. 15 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS With effect from December 2, the Maltese monetary authorities adjusted the Maltese lira for- mula by reincluding the Italian lira and the Belgian franc in the currency basket. The new weights were derived on the basis of the average merchandise trade flows and transit-related foreign exchange earnings during the three years to mid-1985. Future movements in the Maltese lira rate will thus reflect more closely the behavior in the international foreign exchange market of the currencies of Malta's major trading partners. Mauritania adjusted the exchange rate of the ouguiya on February 15, from UM 67.15 = US$1 to UM 80 = US$1, representing a 16 percent devaluation in terms of the U.S. dollar. In addition, all broken cross-rates were eliminated. Nepal changed the mid-point exchange rate of the rupee on November 30, from NRs 17.50 per U.S. dollar to NRs 20.50 per U.S. dollar, repre- senting a devaluation of 14.6 percent. The new official buying and selling rates are NRs 20.40 per U.S. dollar and NRs 20.60 per U .S. dollar, respectively. The three-tier exchange market system of Sudan was replaced on February 12 by a dual exchange rate system to be operated exclusively by the central bank and the commercial banks (to the exclusion of previously licensed private dealers). The official exchange rate for the Sudanese pound was set at US$1 = LSd 2.50; this rate represented a 48 per- cent depreciation from the previous rate of US$1 = LSd 1.30. Transactions in this market were en- larged to include certain export proceeds and imports previously channeled through the com- mercial bank market. The commercial bank rate was initially set at US$1 = LSd 3.00 (com- pared to the previous commercial bank rate of US$1 = LSd 2.10 and a free market averaging US$1 = LSd 3.6 in January 1985). On March 23 a circular was issued by the Bank of Sudan permitting commercial banks to set independently their own buying and selling rates for foreign currencies. Sweden announced that, with effect from June 27, it would narrow the margin within which the foreign currency index is permitted to fluctuate and publish the margin. Fluctuations are limited up to a maximum of 1.5 percent in comparison to the earlier margin of 2.25 percent. The index will then be permitted to move between a minimum of 130 and a maximum of 134 around the benchmark set at 132. Changes in exchange rates or exchange ar- rangements in 1985 of currencies subject to the category "More Flexible Arrangements" are shown 16 in Table 4. Among the countries with exchange arrangements classified as "More Flexible," three countries adjusted their exchange rates "According to a Set of Indicators." Chile devalued the exchange rate of the peso vis- a-vis the U.S. dollar by 8.3 percent on February 27 fromCh$132 .17 = US$1 to Ch$144.07 = US$1. On June 29 the peso was devalued by 14.7 percent against the U .S. dollar to Ch$168.9 = US$1. Also with effect from that date, it was announced that the peso would be adjusted on a daily basis through August 1985 at a rate equal to 1.7 percent per month, after which the former practice of adjusting the rate daily on the basis of the previous month's rate of inflation less an estimate of international inflation would be resumed. The authorities also announced that the intervention points of the Cen- tral Bank were raised from 0.5 percent on either side of the daily rate to 2 percent. Portugal implemented changes in the operation of the foreign exchange market allowing com- mercial banks to satisfy their foreign exchange requirements among themselves. Under the old system, the foreign exchange needs of commercial banks, as represented by their balance sheets, were settled at noon of each day at a determined exchange rate. In contrast, under the new system exchange rates are not set solely by the Bank of Portugal; rather, the Bank of Portugal informs the commercial banks of the official (intervention) exchange rate on a daily basis. In addition, the commercial banks are free to set exchange rates based on demand and supply. The right of the commercial banks to operate in the interbank foreign exchange market is limited to banks domiciled in Portugal, whether foreign or domestic. With effect from January 1, the official exchange rate of the Somali shilling was devalued by 28 percent in foreign currency terms, from So. Sh. 26 per US$1 to So. Sh. 36 per US$1. During the first eight months of 1985, adjustment of the official rate continued in accordance with the system of pegging to the real SDR. On Novem- ber 2 the exchange rate was adjusted from So. Sh. 40.6083 per U .S. dollar to So. Sh. 42.5 per U.S. dollar, representing a devaluation of 4.5 percent. Six countries classified as "Managed Floating" adjusted their exchange rates in discrete fashion on occasions during 1985. With effect from June 14, Argentina introduced a new monetary unit, the "austral" (A), to replace the peso argentine ($a) as the currency of Argentina. The austral has a value equal to 1,000 pesos. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RATES Table 4.

Exchange rates shown are midpoints of buying and selling rates. 2For those countries that maintain multiple rates, the rate shown is either that quoted by the authorities as the official rate or that used most widely in the country's international transactions. 3Argentina and Israel introduced new currencies in 1985. In each case, one unit of the new currency has a value equal to 1,000 units of the old currency. Between June 14 and December 31, 1985, the value of the austral was maintained at A 0.80 = US$1. Ecuador formally completed the unification of the exchange markets for current international transactions on November 12, by moving the official buying rate to S/. 95.00 per U.S. dollar from S/. 66.50 per U .S. dollar, which had been the exchange rate in the intervention market since September 4, 1985. Ecuador continues to maintain a free market for international capital transactions, in which the exchange rate is determined by market forces. With this action, all transitional provisions 17 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution— REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS to sell foreign exchange at a rate different from the new unified rate have ended, except for the transfer of surpluses generated by foreign oil companies during the period April-August 1985. These sur- pluses may be repatriated at the rate of S/. 67.85 per U .S. dollar, irrespective of the official rate that might prevail at the time the transfer takes place. Greece devalued the drachma on October 11 by 15 percent. Israel devalued the sheqel by 15.8 percent on July 1; on that date, the representative rate was IS 1,500.00 = US$1, as against IS 1,262.40 = US$1 on June 28. In addition, with effect from September 4, the Israeli authorities introduced a new currency unit called the "new sheqel" (plural, sheqalim) with a value equal to 1,000 of the former sheqel. The old and new currencies will be legal tender concurrently for a year following introduc- tion of the new unit, and for a further year it will be possible to convert freely the old sheqel into the new sheqel. New rules regarding the operation of foreign exchange establishments (casas de cambio) were introduced in Mexico on June 5. The parallel exchange market was officially recognized and Mexican banks have been permitted to participate in the free exchange market through their affiliated foreign exchange establishments. On July 11 Mex- ico abolished the so-called "free" exchange market, which was officially set and managed by the commercial banks and covered transactions not authorized through the controlled market (access to this market had been subject to limitations from time to time). Hence, under the new regime announced July 11, purchases and sales of foreign exchange for transactions other than those con- ducted at the controlled market rate took place at the parallel market rate. On July 25 the Mexican authorities announced a 17 percent devaluation of the controlled market, moving the mid-point rate from Mex$232.8 to Mex$279.7 = US$1. On August 5 a new system of managed floating for the controlled market came into effect. Under this system, the "window" exchange rate is to be adjusted daily in unspecified and not necessarily equal amounts. The size of the adjustment is based, inter alia, on the following factors: (1) the demand for and supply of foreign exchange in the controlled market; (2) the objective of obtaining adequate levels of international reserves; (3) the movements of domestic and foreign prices; and (4) movements in other exchange rate relationships. Transactions in the controlled market can be completed at a retail rate, agreed between these parties and the financial 18 institutions authorized to operate in this market, or at the "equilibrium exchange rate" of the day. The latter is determined for the controlled market each day at a fixing session at the Bank of Mexico, where representatives of the various financial in- stitutions operating in this market exchange bids for purchases and sales of foreign exchange; the Bank of Mexico may also submit bids in these sessions. Eventually, the "window" rate would be the equi- librium rate reflecting demand and supply in the controlled market, and the sessions of the Bank of Mexico would be a fixing session to determine a reference rate. As of end-1985, the average "free" exchange rate was Mex$447.5 and the rate in the controlled market was Mex$371.50. Western Samoa discontinued the fixed link be- tween the tala and the New Zealand dollar on March 1. With effect from that date, the exchange rate is determined with reference to a weighted basket of currencies, with account taken also of other factors considered to be important by the authorities. At the same time, the U .S. dollar replaced the New Zealand dollar as the intervention currency. The mid-point exchange rate of the tala changed from WS$2.338 = US$1 on February 28 to WS$2.342 = US$1 on March 1, representing an 0.2 percent depreciation of the tala in terms of the U.S. dollar. Two countries classified as "Independently Float- ing" implemented changes in their exchange arrangements. Bolivia depreciated the peso from $b 8,571 to $b 45,000 per US$1 for foreign exchange purchases in the official exchange market by the Central Bank and commercial banks, with effect from Febru- ary 11, 1985. At the same time, the Central Bank began to apply new selling rates of $b 49,550 to commercial banks and $b 50,000 to the general public, compared with the previous rates of $b 8,995 and $b 9,000 per US$1. On a midpoint basis, this action represented an 81.5 percent depreciation of the Bolivian peso for transactions with the general public. With effect from May 16, the Central Bank's buying rate for the Bolivian peso was further depreciated from $b 45,000 to $b 67,000 per US$1, while new selling rates of $b 74,330 and $b 75,000, respectively, per US$1 were set for exchange sales to commercial banks and the public sector and to the general public. This adjustment represented a 33.1 percent depreciation on a midpoint basis. In addition, the exchange rate for the purchase of travel tickets administered by the Ministry of Aviation was raised from $b 95,000 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES to $b 300,000 per US$1. In August the Bolivian authorities announced that the fixed exchange rate arrangement between the peso and the U.S. dollar would be replaced with a more flexible system under which the exchange rate would be determined by means of periodic auctions operated by the Central Bank of Bolivia. Effective September 2, South Africa reintro- duced a dual exchange rate system; the previous system had been discontinued in 1983. III. Main Developments in Restrictive Practices This chapter surveys major developments in members' restrictive practices affecting international trade and financial transactions. These practices take the form either of quantitative restrictions, or of price - related measures involving implicit or explicit taxes and subsidies affecting international transactions. Most of the practices are described in detail in the chronological sections of the individual country pages in Part Two of this Report. References to the detailed descriptions in Part Two may be obtained from the tables annexed to this chapter, which provide summary descriptions and evaluations and are organized on a subject basis, i.e., by the type of practices involved. Quantitative Import Controls Protectionist pressures for restrictions on imports continued to prevail in many countries in 1985 as world trade grew much more slowly than in 1984. However, a significant intensification of quantita- tive restrictions did not take place, and a number of industrial and developing countries took steps toward relaxation of restrictions, as the threat of a relapse into widespread restrictive actions remained strong. Among the industrial countries, Japan, aiming to alleviate trade frictions announced a program to remove various impediments to im- ports, and New Zealand accelerated the process of phasing out its import licensing system. The United Kingdom's ban on imports from Argentina was removed. In addition, three developing countries— Bolivia, Somalia, and Zambia—almost completely eliminated import restrictions, and wide-ranging liberalization measures were taken in a number of other developing countries, notably Jamaica, Kenya, Mexico, Morocco, Sierra Leone, and Tur- key. Instances of restrictive measures taken by industrial countries were no more numerous than in immediately preceding years, despite intense pres- sures from industries seeking protection. The United States took some further measures to protect its sugar producers, and, with regard to steel, signed new bilateral agreements with the EC, Japan, and several other countries. The United States imposed a trade embargo on Nicaragua and banned imports of South African kruggerand and Libyan refined petroleum products. Restrictions were intensified in a number of developing coun- tries—extensively in Peru, Seychelles, and Tunisia —but a greater number of countries in- troduced liberalization measures. In the industrial countries, all of the broad multilateral changes in quantitative restrictions were in the direction of liberalization. Japan, after announcing in April 1985 a program aimed at opening domestic markets to various categories of imports, released a policy document in July listing actions aimed at increasing imports. These included a relaxation of minimum standards and certification requirements and of the treatment of foreign pro- ducers in government procurement procedures. In New Zealand it was announced in September 1985 that the import licensing system for goods not covered by industry development plans would be phased out by 1988. To reduce the restrictiveness of the system in the interim, several measures were announced in 1985. In July authorization was granted for the free transfer of licenses between importers. In September it was announced that from July 1986 licenses for certain items would be issued freely; that those items still subject to licensing would be reviewed in order to determine the basis on which they might be removed from licensing; and that import access would be increased by at least 5 percent of the domestic market on January 1, 1987. In December 1985 the New Zealand authori- ties decided to liberalize import access for certain types of goods produced by the New Zealand Steel Company. In Italy the minimum values of transac- tions requiring exchange control and import docu- mentation were both doubled, and in the former case some items were exempted. 19 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS Bilateral or unilateral measures taken by indus- trial countries, relating to general imports from particular countries were mixed in their liberalizing or restricting effects. A Free Trade Area Agreement was signed by the United States and Israel in April 1985 and came into effect in September; it con- tained a number of measures designed to eliminate all tariffs by January 1, 1995 and to reduce nontariff barriers, including reductions in licensing restric- tions and greater access to government procurement procedures. The United Kingdom's ban on imports from Argentina, in effect since 1982, was removed in July 1985. On the other hand, the United States imposed a trade embargo on Nicaragua in May. Discussions between Canada and the United States also took place in March 1985 on possible ways to reduce existing barriers to bilateral trade. Subse- quently, Canada and the United States decided to undertake negotiations for a free trade agreement. The other measures taken by the industrial countries were specific to particular imports— notably, agricultural products, textiles, steel, and motor vehicles. Measures taken with respect to agricultural prod- ucts (notably, sugar and meat) in 1985;were, on balance, restrictive. Canada increased its global quotas on imports of beef and veal, and Japan raised its quota for apple juice. In the United States the import volume of tuna fish subject to tariff- quota was raised by 8 percent, but other changes were restrictive, mainly relating to sugar. In Jan- uary 1985 the sugar import quota year was extended by two months through November 1985, and emergency quotas were imposed on certain items containing sugar or judged to be interfering with the domestic sugar price support program. Certain exemptions to these quotas were later introduced, and two countries were added to the list of those authorized to sell limited amounts of sugar to the United States. Restrictions against textile imports were again intensified in 1985. Canada broadened the cover- age of bilateral export restraints with a number of Asian countries and reached new bilateral agree- ments with Bangladesh and Malaysia, all related to specific clothing items. Canada's special arrange- ment with Brazil for imports from the latter was also broadened. The EC applied quantitative restrictions on imports from Bangladesh for the first time, and imposed strict limits on imports from Turkey, one of the EC's largest suppliers. The list of products covered by the bilateral agreement between the EC and Brazil was also expanded. France suspended the automatic issuance of import 20 licenses for cotton cloth originating from Taiwan1 for the period between May and October 1985 and also imposed a temporary limit on imports of certain textile products from Turkey. A new agree- ment was reached on restraints on Korea's cotton yarn exports to Japan. The United States imposed new quota limits on certain textile categories from a number of countries, and concluded bilateral re- straint agreements with several countries (including Indonesia and Sri Lanka) following countervailing duty investigations. The United States also tight- ened its "country of origin" requirements for textile and apparel imports in 1985. In the steel sector, the United States signed new bilateral agreements with the EC and Japan on exports to the United States from these countries, covering product lines not previously restricted. An agreement with the EC was reached in January 1985 regarding restraints on the EC's exports of steel pipes and tubes to the United States; this followed a temporary ban imposed by the United States in late 1984 in response to an increase in EC steel imports beyond agreed levels. In August 1985 the United States and the EC reached agreement on quantitative limits for certain steel products that had formerly been subject to consultation only. Subse- quently, in November the United States and the EC agreed on quantitative limits on all EC steel products, except semifinished steel, to be exported to the United States in the period January 1986- September 1989; and at the end of the year the United States announced ceilings for semifinished steel for the same period. An agreement reached by the United States with Japan in May 1985 limited Japanese steel exports to the United States to 5.8 percent of U .S. consumption annually in the five years from October 1984. Moreover, the United States entered into bilateral agreements with several other countries, notably, Brazil, Korea, Hungary, and Romania, under which specific limits were placed on exports to the United States. Regarding the EC's steel import policy, the monitoring and licensing system continued in 1985. Two industrial countries reduced their restric- tions on imports of motor vehicles. At the begin- ning of the year, Ireland discontinued its special restrictions on motor vehicle imports. In March the United States announced that it would not seek a further extension of Japan's voluntary restraints on passenger car exports to the United States, which had been in effect for four years. Subsequently, however, Japan announced unilaterally a limit on tSee Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part Two, page 75. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES such exports to the United States in the year ending March 1986, but at a level more than 24 percent higher than in the previous year. Other measures liberalizing quantitative import restrictions included Canada's decision to remove quotas on all categories of shoe imports except women's and girls' footwear and to phase out the remaining quotas on imported shoes over the next three years, and the announcement by the Japanese authorities of their intention to remove restrictions on imports of refined petroleum products. In addi- tion, the Federal Republic of Germany lifted re- strictions on imports of electrical insulators from Japan. A number of developing countries reduced their import restrictions and simplified their import re- gimes in 1985. Import restrictions were practically eliminated in Somalia in January. They were also virtually eliminated in Bolivia in August, in con- junction with a floating of the exchange rate, although licensing was later temporarily reimposed for imports of sugar. In Hungary the quasi- automatic import licensing system, which had been replaced in 1982 by a system of quotas and individual approvals, was fu l ly restored. Also, in Zambia it was announced in October, as part of an exchange reform, that import licenses would in the future be issued without restriction. An important liberalization of the import regime took place in Jamaica in April, eliminating quotas and substan- tially reducing the number of items subject to licensing. Liberalizing measures covering a broad range of imports were also taken in a number of other countries. In Argentina the number of goods eligible for automatic licensing was increased on three occasions (in particular, to include various items of machinery and electrical equipment), and the list of prohibited imports was suspended through the second half of the year. In Grenada the importation of a wide range of goods was liberal- ized. India, in the context of the import-export policy for 1985-88, abolished in April the auto- matic permissible import category with respect to raw materials and spare parts. Some 90 percent of the items in this category were placed under open general license, and the remainder were shifted to the limited permissible category. With respect to industrial machinery, some 200 items were added to the open general license category. In addition, the import monopoly of public agencies was abol- ished for a number of products. Israel lifted in February a six-month ban on the importation of some 50 "luxury" commodities and replaced it with an advance deposit requirement. In Kenya there was a ^classification of certain imports for licens- ing purposes, which entailed a large increase in the number of items eligible for automatic licensing. In Korea the proportion of import items automatically approved was increased from 85 percent to 87 percent; a large number of items were liber- alized, and the Government announced a list of items scheduled to be liberalized at a similar rate during 1986-88. In July the Mexican authorities announced that the process of abolishing import permits and replacing them with protective tariffs was being accelerated. The requirement for import permits was abolished with respect to some 3,600 items. There was also a reclassification of imports in Morocco, entailing a reduction in the number of prohibited items and an increase in the number of goods that could be imported freely. Turkey re- duced a previously extensive list of prohibited imports to only three considered dangerous to public security or health, and also reduced the list of items subject to prior authorization. Venezuela removed items classified under some 250 customs headings from the lists of commodities importable only by the public sector or under license. Several developing countries took liberalizing measures that were less broad in scope than in the countries referred to above, or that were partly offset by some increases in restrictions. Ecuador removed prohibitions on a significant number of import items, but also lowered the priority classifi- cation of a smaller number of items and introduced prior authorization requirements for a few imports. Indonesia announced that import invoices for four neighboring countries no longer required official approval, and also normalized trade relations with the People's Republic of China; but also during the year certain imported materials were made subject to restrictions. Malta lifted restrictions on imports from Italy, which had applied to all items other than industrial materials, spare parts, and essential com- modities. Limited liberalization measures were also announced in Algeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sierra Leone, the Syrian Arab Republic, and Zimbabwe. Four developing countries announced modifica- tions of their import regimes in 1985 with overall restrictive or liberalizing effects that are uncertain. Bangladesh introduced two lists of restricted import items to replace the former system of three categories of permitted imports. Items not on the two restricted lists were made freely importable through the secondary market by registered import- ers. Nigeria modified procedures for licensing imports and allocating foreign exchange, making an 21 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS import license a guarantee of the availability of foreign exchange up to the value stated on the license. In December Yugoslavia announced that an exchange reform would be brought into effect at the beginning of 1986, under which the right to make import payments will be directly linked to the right to offset the import transaction itself. Imports will be classified into four categories: free, conditionally free, subject to quota, and subject to licensing. Thailand took some liberalizing and some restric- tive measures in relation to various import items; their net effect is uncertain. The number of developing countries in which quantitative import restrictions were introduced or tightened in 1985 was smaller than the number in which liberalization occurred. Restrictions were increased extensively in three countries. In Peru prior licensing requirements were imposed in August on many items; this action followed the imposition of such requirements on a number of specified items at various times earlier in the year and the establishment of a committee in the Ministry of Commerce, Trade, and Tourism to administer the import licensing system. Import licensing requirements were abolished, however, for imports covered by certain trade agreements with other Latin American countries. In Seychelles all imports were made subject in February to permits and licenses; previously, most goods could be imported freely under open general licenses. In addition, the public monopoly over the importation of certain food staples was extended to other basic foodstuffs. In Tunisia all import items, other than those included in a specified free list (the latter comprising mainly medical products and spare parts not produced locally) or spare parts imported by certain industries for their own use, were made subject to import licensing in Ju ly, and in the same month certain capital goods imports became subject to prior authorization. These measures followed a simplification of import procedures in June, includ- ing the partial elimination of licensing requirements for goods destined for re-export and small imports of certain raw materials and equipment. There were also wide-ranging restrictive mea- sures in El Salvador, where some imports were temporarily prohibited, and in Paraguay, where all importers were required to register with the Central Bank to satisfy certain financial requirements and to obtain bank guarantees for imports in excess of twice their capital. Restrictive measures limited to a narrower range of goods were taken in Barbados (various import items); Brazil (steel products and nonferrous metals); Fiji (various foods and certain 22 materials); Honduras (textiles, construction mate- rials, and certain other items); Indonesia (a pes- ticide and certain plastic materials); Kuwa it (certain steel pipes); Nigeria (maize and rice); Rwanda (cement and certain other items); and Western Samoa (capital equipment). Import Surcharges and Import Taxation In 1985 world trade was promoted by the acceler- ated implementation by industrial countries of tariff cuts scheduled under the Tokyo Round, by their renewal of preferential schemes for developing countries' exports, and by wide-ranging tariff re- ductions in certain developing countries —notably, Bolivia, Chile, Guinea, Kenya, and Morocco. However, the United States introduced a number of antidumping and countervailing duties, and a num- ber of developing countries increased general du ty levels —notably, among the oil producers, Kuwa i t, Saudi Arabia, and Trinidad and Tobago; and, among non-oil producers, Argentina, Jamaica, Liberia, Mauritius, South Africa, Tunisia, Uru- guay, and Zaire. In addition to the sixth tariff cut scheduled for 1985 under the Tokyo Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations (MTN), the seventh installment was implemented one year ahead of schedule on Janu- ary 1 by Austria, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland; and Norway and Sweden also on the same date became the first countries to implement the final (eighth) installment. In the case of the EC, advanced tariff reductions as of January 1, 1985, were confined, in the absence of comparable action by the EC's trading partners, to several hundred items of export interest to developing countries. The EC announced that should such action mate- rialize in 1985, it would accelerate reductions on the remaining items included in the next annual installment. With effect from April 1, 1985, Japan announced tariff cuts, advanced by two years, on imports of agricultural products from developing countries and nonagricultural products; tariff cuts were advanced by one year on additional agricul- tural products. In July Japan announced its inten- tion to eliminate or reduce unilaterally tariffs on a number of imports as early as possible in 1986, and also, in the context of a new round of MTN, to reduce tariffs on industrial products to zero along with other industrial countries. In early 1985 the New Zealand authorities issued a discussion paper outlining a tariff reform policy. Later in the year, tariff reductions for 1986 and 1987 were announced. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES By the end of 1984, with the extension of the United States' General System of Preferences (GSP) for eight-and-a-half years to July 1993, all the donor countries had renewed their respective preferential schemes for a further period beyond the initial ten-year period. With respect to more recent changes in GSP schemes, there has been an increased emphasis on extending benefits to the least-developed countries. The United States desig- nated 32 countries as "least-developed" benefici- aries of special trade incentives under the GSP, and these countries were placed in a new category exempted from competitive need limits. Similarly, New Zealand extended to the 36 least-developed countries duty-free access for all products, and adopted a per capita income threshold above which countries could no longer qualify for preferential treatment. Other changes included a major review of the Norwegian scheme that led to the inclusion of additional agricultural and indus- trial imports; and Japan took steps to improve the GSP by reducing tariff rates and raising quantitative limits. Canada raised general preference tariff rates on motor vehicle parts, but lowered the rates on various goods not produced domestically. Among other measures taken by the industrial countries, the United States, Canada, and Japan agreed to eliminate tariffs on computer parts, in a move to liberalize trade in high-technology prod- ucts. Canada implemented the agreement in Jan- uary 1986, but reinstated tariffs in June 1986. Under the terms of the United States-Israel Free Trade Agreement (referred to in the previous section), most tariffs are to be progressively re- duced and eliminated by 1995. Among other liberalizing measures, the United States extended for another year most favored nation (MFN) tariff treatment for Romania, Hungary, and the People's Republic of China and eliminated import duties on certain aircraft equipment and parts. However, the United States sharply increased duties on pasta products imported from the EC, in retaliation for the EC's decision not to modify its preferential tariff treatment for citrus f ru it from certain Mediter- ranean countries following a GATT panel finding that the EC preferences were adversely affecting U.S. exports of oranges and lemons. In response to this measure, the EC raised its tariffs on wa lnu ts and lemons from the United States. The United States also imposed anti-dumping duties on a few imports from certain countries and countervailing duties on certain imports, notably, textiles and apparel from Argentina, Mexico, Peru, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. Among the oil-exporting developing countries, Indonesia introduced a revised tariff schedule linked to the introduction of a value-added tax, and also signed the GATT Code on Subsidies and Countervailing Duties. Otherwise, the measures taken in 1985 were restrictive: Kuwait introduced duties on a number of goods, notably paper and chemical products; Saudi Arabia raised its mini- mum tariff on dutiable imports from 4 percent to 7 percent; and Trinidad and Tobago imposed a stamp duty of 18 percent on all imports other than food and drugs. In a number of non-oil exporting developing countries the burden of import duties was reduced, and in some cases there were important and wide- ranging reductions in tariff rates; on balance, liberalizing measures dominated. In Bolivia, tariff rates were reduced to 10 percent of the former rates, plus 10 percentage points. Chile lowered its uni- form tariff rate, in two steps, from 35 percent to 20 percent. Guinea eliminated duties on a number of important foodstuffs and reduced those on construction materials by 50 percent. Kenya re- duced tariffs by an average of 12 percent on a range of industrial inputs and capital goods, and by 10 percent on unassembled motor cars. Korea reduced the number of items on its "elastic tariff list by five. Mexico introduced a new tariff struc- ture. Morocco reduced from 10 percent to 7.5 per- cent the special tax on imports. Limited exemptions from import duties were permitted in Brazil and Tunisia. In several other non-oil exporting developing countries, changes in tariffs in 1985 were mixed, involving increases for some goods and decreases for others (mainly involving regional or bilateral preferences). Argentina raised its tariffs by 10 per- centage points (and by a further 10 percentage points for certain meat products), but reduced the tariff on cotton from 21 percent to zero and granted preferential tariff treatment to certain imports from other Latin American countries. In Peru import tariffs were raised by 5-13 percent in January, and in May the import surcharge was raised from 15 percent to 17 percent; but in July tariff rates on imports from the Latin American Integration Asso- ciation (LAIA) countries were reduced by 3-7 per- centage points, and at various times in the year duties on certain items were reduced or eliminated. In Thailand there was a wide-ranging revision of the structure of import duties, entailing increases for some items and reductions for others. In Uruguay import surcharge rates were raised uni- formly by 5 percentage points until the end of 1986, 23 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS but certain additional Argentinian goods were made freely importable. In Vanuatu the general rate of service tax on most imports was raised from 3 percent to 5 percent at the end of the year, and the exception from duties of government imports was withdrawn; but earlier in the year the customs service tax rate on imports bought by tourists for re- export was lowered from 12 percent to 5 percent. In Dominica, Grenada, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, in conformity with a Caribbean Com- mon Market (CARICOM) agreement of 1984, com- mon external tariffs were raised on certain items, while tariffs on certain regional products were reduced. In other non-oil exporting developing countries, changes in duties were restrictiv In Belize the stamp duty rate on imports MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES to the parallel market; previously, 50 percent had been eligible for financing at the official market rate. In Guatemala, which has a three-tier exchange rate system, access to the official foreign exchange market was authorized for certain aid-related im- ports of foodstuffs, while settlement for certain other items was switched to the banking market from the official market; also, the list of imports eligible to be channeled through the auction market was increased. Guatemala also imposed a 31/2 per- cent tax on foreign exchange operations for im- ports, with certain exemptions. In Nicaragua a number of measures were taken. In February 1985 eligibility for financing at the principal official exchange rate was granted to payments for specified non-essential consumer goods; a preferential ex- change rate was introduced for imports of raw materials, spare parts, and certain essential goods; and another exchange rate, entailing a higher foreign currency price than in the official market, was established for imports of a wide range of capital goods. In April the principal official rate was made applicable to imports of petroleum products. Subsequently, in May it was announced that foreign exchange for payment of imports not eligible for the official market could be purchased in a newly authorized "free" market. In February 1986 a new principal official rate was introduced, entailing a devaluation, and the new rate was made applicable to all imports other than petroleum products, to which the previous official rate contin- ued to apply. In Venezuela, which maintains a four- tier exchange rate system, the authorities in 1985 approved periodic transfers of import items from the list eligible for financing at the first tier (entailing the lowest price of foreign exchange) to those eligible for financing at the third tier. In Argentina import payments for certain goods originating in Chile, Ecuador, and Paraguay were exempted from minimum financing requirements and were permitted to be settled in full or in part against shipping documents or on credit. Also, the Central Bank announced that the term of import finance would be automatically extended when import payments were not made by the originally agreed maturity date. In Cyprus the maximum value of advance payments for imports was in- creased five times. In Maldives the regulation requiring all imports to be made on a letter of credit basis was removed. In the Philippines permission was granted to authorized agent banks to sell foreign exchange for imports of specified consumer goods without prior approval of the Central Bank; less stringent minimum payment terms and financ- ing requirements were also introduced for certain imports. In the Syrian Arab Republic private sector manufacturing and crafts establishments were au- thorized to finance imports and spare parts with letters of credit or bills of collection granted under 180-day credit arrangements; and authorization was also granted for imports of certain agricultural products and equipment under similar arrange- ments. There were also limited reductions in such restrictions in Honduras, Pakistan, and Thailand. A number of other developing countries took other liberalizing measures that were partly or wholly offset by new restrictions. In January Egypt introduced new restrictions on the use of different types of bank accounts for import payments, but these measures were largely reversed in April. In Israel the requirement in- troduced in 1984, that noncommercial vehicle imports be financed with foreign credit, was elimi- nated; but the suspension of foreign exchange sales for import prepayment was extended for another year until August 1986. In Nepal the margin deposit requirement for the opening of import letters of credit by firms engaged in projects sponsored by the World Bank was reduced from 30 percent to 10 percent of the value of imports of raw materials, machinery, and spare parts; but the margin deposit requirement on letters of credit for imports of luxury goods was raised from 50 percent to 75 percent. In Somalia the franco valuta import system, whereby imports could be financed with foreign exchange held abroad, was abolished in January 1985, and a regulation was introduced requiring importers to process import documents through the domestic banking system. In November the Somalian authorities permitted the importation of petroleum products by the private sector. In Western Samoa the minimum import payment for which letters of credit were obligatory was halved in September. In the Yemen Arab Republic the proportion of commercial banks' foreign exchange purchases to be used to finance officially specified imports was raised, and also commercial banks were prohibited from opening letters of credit in foreign currency; subsequently, however, importers were authorized to use up to half of their foreign currency deposits to finance specified imports. A few countries took restrictive measures alone. Costa Rica introduced a regulation requiring all trade with Central American countries to be settled in U .S. dollars. In Ecuador the Central Bank was prohibited from making advance sales of foreign currency for imports of most goods and services. In South Africa the standstill arrangement introduced 25 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS in respect of debt repayments was also made applicable to imports received before 1985. In Sudan the authority to validate imports transacted through the commercial bank foreign exchange market was transferred from the commercial banks to the Bank of Sudan, and the f inanc ing of imports in that market was restricted to foreign exchange from banks' own resources or from customers' accounts. In Zambia a requirement was introduced that air freight charges on own-financed imports should be paid in foreign currency. State Trading As in recent years, there were few changes in members' state trading practices in the period under review. These changes were somewhat in the direction of liberalization on balance. Four coun- tries ended state monopolies: on all imports (The Gambia); tobacco (Haiti); and petroleum (Zaire). In addition, Hungary granted rights to additional enterprises to engage in foreign trade, and India abolished import monopoly of public agencies over a number of products. Six countries tightened regulations: restricting gold and diamond mining to government and mixed-economy companies (Guinea); requiring exports of wheat and paddy seeds to be canalized through one agency (India); establishing a monopoly on exports of gold and diamonds (Sierra Leone); extending import mono- poly to include rice and sugar in sachets (Togo); and creating a national trading corporation for the importation of raw materials by public enterprises (Zaire). Exports and Export Proceeds Measures taken in 1985 affecting exports and export proceeds generally reflected the persistence of difficulties in trade relations among industrial countries and between industrial and developing countries and continued efforts by developing coun- tries to stimulate exports. Only a few industrial countries modified their export practices, and these modifications suggested on balance neither an overall increase or decrease in restrictiveness by this group of countries. The modifications included reduced quantitative restrictions on some exports and tighter limits on others, liberalized provisions for export credits, relaxed licensing requirements for exporters, and a mixed performance with respect to fiscal incentives for exporters. Measures 26 in developing countries included increased fiscal incentives for exports, reduced export taxes, and liberalized foreign exchange surrender require- ments, as these countries stepped up their efforts to support exporters in the face of continued although reduced balance of payments difficulties and declin- ing imports. Another factor affecting developing countries was protectionist measures implemented by the industrial countries, to which some devel- oping countries responded by imposing "voluntary" export restraints or by taxing the economic rents created by the protectionist measures abroad. Ef- forts to reduce supply to export markets in order to counter the effects on prices of weak export markets for commodities, as well as measures to bolster the supply of exportable goods to exporting countries' domestic markets, were also reflected in increased quantitative controls and export taxation by some developing countries. There were few major modifications in 1985 in the stance of the major trading countries as regards quantitative restrictions on exports. Responding to pressures from other industrial countries, Japan introduced limits on its exports of steel products to the United States but increased limits on exports of cars to the United States. The limits on Japanese exports of videotape recorders to the EC were lifted in December 1985 and replaced with tariffs in EC countries. The United Kingdom lifted its ban on exports to Argentina. The United States tightened its regulations on exports of computer software and, as part of a package of economic measures against South Africa, banned nuclear exports to that coun- try and computer exports to agencies of the South African government dealing with race relation policies. Seven developing countries banned ex- ports of products, such as cotton (Argentina); steel and sisal fiber (Brazil); sugar syrup and fish oil (Peru); textile products and clothing items exported to the United States (South Africa); petroleum products (Thailand); live birds (Togo); and a broader list of products (Ecuador). Five developing countries granted permission for exports of specific products that were previously restricted (India, Kuwa i t, Nepal, Thailand, and Tunisia). There were also a few changes in regula- tions affecting export licensing. France abolished and the United States simplified licensing require- ments, and the United States imposed licensing requirements on exports to Nicaragua. Actions by developing countries were mixed. Five countries liberalized their licensing system (Ecuador, India, Peru, Somalia, and Western Samoa), and two others (Suriname and Thailand) tightened theirs. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES Only two industrial countries changed their fiscal incentive schemes for exports. New Zealand sub- stantially reduced such incentives, and the United States increased subsidies to agricultural exports through the newly implemented Export Enhance- ment Program. A larger number of developing countries increased export incentives by increasing rebates on all products exported (Argentina, Ban- gladesh, Costa Rica, Hungary, and Mexico) or on specific products or groups of products (Argentina, Hungary, India, Pakistan, Peru, Thailand, and Uruguay). Only two developing countries reduced fiscal incentives by eliminating or reducing rebates (Nepal and Turkey). Several developing countries reduced export taxation (Argentina, India, In- donesia, and Thailand); a few (Brazil, Dominican Republic, and Malawi) imposed taxes on exports. Three industrial countries increased the access of exporters to credit facilities. France relaxed regula- tions for provision of export credits by the private sector, and New Zealand terminated the suspensory loan scheme. Foreign currency financing require- ments for exports were abolished in Italy. Only two developing countries used this policy instrument actively in 1985 in the direction of increased official support, by establishing new bilateral lines of credit or renewing existing ones (Argentina), and by reducing below-market interest rates applicable to these lines of credit (Argentina and Brazil). In the area of export or exchange guarantees, two industrial countries modified regulations involving these schemes. Switzerland raised the premia paid on export risk guarantee and suspended foreign exchange risk coverage indefinitely, and the United Kingdom set up a new export insurance scheme for exports to smallest countries. Israel limited official liability under an exchange rate insurance scheme, and Tunisia implemented the export credit insur- ance scheme which had been introduced in 1984. Requirements for the surrender of export pro- ceeds were modified in several developing coun- tries, mostly in the direction of permitting larger retention quotas or reducing the proportion of proceeds to be surrendered at the official exchange rate. Major modifications were introduced in eight countries (Bangladesh, Benin, El Salvador, Guatemala, Madagascar, Mexico, Somalia, and Tanzania), and four other countries (Honduras, Nicaragua, Paraguay, and Sierra Leone) imple- mented measures affecting specific products. Only four developing countries tightened surrender re- quirements, limiting the surrender period to 30 days (Peru) and increasing the proportion of exports to be surrendered at the official exchange rate or tourism market rate (Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, and Yugoslavia). Various other measures were implemented in the period under review, generally with the intention of supporting exports or streamlining administrative procedures. Information requirements and review processes for export activities were simplified in the United States. Several developing countries tight- ened their administrative procedures, requiring that settlements of trade with Central America be made in U .S. dollars (Costa Rica); requiring letters of credit arrangements for specified exports (Nepal); establishing reporting and eligibility requirements for exporting firms (Paraguay); and requiring proof of availability of foreign exchange on the part of the foreign importer (Trinidad and Tobago). Two de- veloping countries liberalized administrative proce- dures authorizing additional locations for export and import activities (Indonesia), and abolishing inspection and export clearance requirements with limited exceptions (Philippines). Current Invisibles Regulations governing current invisibles were somewhat relaxed on balance in 1985. Most of the measures related to foreign exchange allocations for tourism and other travel abroad. Measures were also taken to effect payments for services per- formed by nonresidents, as well as holdings of foreign currency and imports and exports of bank notes and coins. All changes in regulations tighten- ing current invisible transactions were undertaken by the developing countries, in an attempt to reduce capital flight and to curb use of foreign exchange for tourism. During 1985 three industrial countries relaxed regulations on foreign exchange allocations by raising outward remittances for family support (France); by relaxing regulations for the use of credit cards abroad (Italy); or by increasing alloca- tions for business and tourist travel (Spain). Among developing countries, several countries increased basic travel allowances (Chile, Cyprus, Morocco, Portugal, Somalia, Tunisia, and Zimbabwe); autho- rized use of credit cards abroad (Israel); lifted prohibition of official foreign exchange sales for tourist travel to Italy (Malta); abolished foreign exchange allowance for tourist travel (Ethiopia); and transferred purchases of foreign exchange for travel and medical treatment to the banking market (Guatemala). Cyprus, Morocco, and Zimbabwe raised education allowances; and El Salvador abol- 27 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS ished the restrictive aspect of the advance import deposit on foreign exchange requests for medical treatment abroad. A few developing countries tightened regulations governing foreign exchange allocations for travel by reducing or establish- ing allowances for travel (Israel, Ethiopia, and Suriname) and lowering limits on exchange avail- able for studies abroad (Korea). Regulations governing outward transfers or pay- ments for services rendered by nonresidents were modified in only one industrial country (Finland), where the requirement of central bank approval for transfer abroad of dividends on nonresident direct investment was abolished. Japan announced its readiness to discuss the relaxation of existing restrictions on services (as part of the so-called Action Program). Several developing countries relaxed regulations on all invisible payments (Bolivia); on outward remittances concerning mem- bership fees (Bangladesh); pension funds (Bar- bados); various types of invisibles (Botswana); transfer privileges (Libya and Morocco); workers' remittances (Iraq and Philippines); freight and interest charges (Brazil and Philippines); repatriate remittances (Morocco and Zambia); and profits and dividends (Zimbabwe). A stamp duty on purchases of foreign exchange was eliminated in Nepal and an ad valorem tax on travel tickets was abolished in Dominica. Also, conversion of foreign exchange proceeds from invisibles was transferred to the parallel or free market in El Salvador and Nicara- gua, and Somalia authorized exchange retention quotas. Payments for invisibles were effected through the banking market in Guatemala. Several developing countries tightened regula- tions on outward transfers concerning leasing of real estate abroad (Brazil); some specified invisible payments (El Salvador); payments of wages in foreign currency abroad to nationals (Israel); profit remittances (Nigeria and South Africa); and sales of transportable goods and pension payments (Suriname). Israel imposed a surcharge on airline and sea tickets and extended the period for applica- tion of the tax on imports of services. Maldives required documentary proof of sales of foreign exchange from tourist resorts and foreigners when paying domestic taxes and rents; Sudan granted a bonus on workers' remittances; and Sierra Leone and Suriname required nonresidents to exchange specified minimum amounts of foreign currency when entering the country. Regulations affecting the import and export of foreign and domestic currency notes and coins and holdings of foreign currency were relaxed in two 28 industrial countries (Iceland and Spain). Among developing countries, Cyprus increased the max- imum amount of Cyprus bank notes that could be imported or exported; Guinea authorized residents to hold foreign currency; Nepal authorized com- mercial banks to accept specified deposits denomi- nated in U .S. dollars and pounds sterling and regulated withdrawals on these deposits; Pakistan increased the maximum period from day of arrival for nationals to hold foreign currency accounts and authorized dealers to accept specified deposits in foreign currency; and the Philippines tightened regulations on over-the-counter purchases of for- eign coins. Sudan imposed restrictions on "free" foreign exchange accounts and prohibited private nonbank exchange dealers to conduct foreign ex- change operations. External Payments Arrears Payments arrears are attributable to a variety of causes; the Fund's data on members' payments arrears cover arrears that have been caused by exchange restrictions on current payments or trans- fers, as well as arrears on financial obligations of which the obligor is the government or a resident in the country in question and which are overdue for balance of payments or fiscal reasons.5 An increase in arrears adversely affects the country's cred- itworthiness, with the result that access to normal means of international financing is frequently cur- tailed. A further consequence is that the cost of international credit, as well as of imported goods and services, becomes higher than would otherwise be the case for most borrowers. In view of the 5 Payments arrears evidence an exchange restriction under the Fund's Article VIII, Section 2(a) or Article XIV, Section 2, when the authorities of a country are responsible for undue delays in approving applications or in meeting bona fide requests for foreign exchange for current international transac- tions as defined in Article XXX (d). Accordingly, when a government or a government entity, whose financial operations form part of the budgetary process, fails to meet an external payments obligation due to a lack of domestic currency resources, the resulting arrears are considered to evidence defaults by the government rather than exchange restrictions. Similarly, arrears incurred by governments participating in a common central bank are treated as defaults when they are due to the government's inability to obtain domestic currency with which to purchase needed foreign exchange from the common central bank. Although these distinctions are relevant for the purposes of Articles VIII and XIV, in the context of the Fund's policies on the use of its resources, defaults and other forms of arrears involving current and capital payments are viewed as having the same broad macroeconomic character and conse- quences, and are therefore treated in the same manner. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES particularly adverse consequences for the country maintaining arrears and for the international pay- ments system, performance criteria for the elimina- tion or substantial reduction of payments arrears in an orderly and nondiscriminatory manner constitute an important element of members' economic pro- grams supported by the use of the Fund's re- sources.6 Moreover, the incurrence of arrears and related policies have been subject to careful scrutiny in the context of Article IV consultations with the Fund. The Fund has also consistently followed the practice of not approving under Arti- cle VIII, Section 2(a) of the Fund's Articles of Agreement exchange restrictions evidenced by ar- rears on current international payments, except when a satisfactory program for a reduction or the elimination of arrears is in place. During 1985 the total payments arrears (includ- ing government defaults) of Fund members de- clined significantly for the first time in recent years, mainly as a result of restructuring. At the end of 1985, they amounted to SDR 27 billion, reversing the increasing trend of the 1982-84 period. How- ever, the number of Fund members incurring payments arrears (including government defaults) remained at its peak of 49 reached at end-1983. Of the 49 member countries incurring, or believed to be incurring, external payments arrears (including government defaults) at the end of 1985, informa- tion for the end of 1985 is available for the following 48 countries: Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Benin, Bolivia, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Peo- ple's Republic of the Congo, Costa Rica, Domini- can Republic, Egypt, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, The Gambia, Ghana, Grenada, Guate- mala, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Liberia, Madagascar, Mali, Morocco, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Para- guay, Peru, St. Lucia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Suriname, Tanzania, Uganda, Venezuela, Viet Nam, Western Samoa, Yugo- slavia, Zaire, and Zambia. Data at the end of 1985 for Sao Tome and Principe, which had payments arrears at the end of 1984, are not available, but it is unlikely that it was able to eliminate outstanding payments arrears in the course of 1985. During 1985 payments arrears (including government de- faults) were eliminated in Belize, Cote d'lvoire, Ecuador, Mauritania, the Philippines, and Togo; and in one country, Senegal, payments arrears 6The major conclusions of reviews of Fund policies were summarized in the Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions, 1983, and 1985. (including government defaults) emerged for the first time since 1981. In the course of 1985, of the countries that had payments arrears (including government defaults) at the end of 1984, the outstanding amount rose in 25 countries (Antigua and Barbuda, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Chad, Com- oros, People's Republic of the Congo, The Gam- bia, Guatemala, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Liberia, Morocco, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Suriname, Tanzania, and Uganda), and declined in 15 countries (Argentina, Central African Republic, Costa Rica, Dominican Re- public, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Madagascar, Nigeria, Somalia, Venezuela, Viet Nam, Western Samoa, Zaire, and Zambia). During 1985 external debt obligations to official creditors and commercial banks of 22 Fund member countries, which in some instances were in arrears, were rescheduled and/or refinanced. In addition, negotiations were in progress with two countries. The total amount of external debt obligations that were restructured in 1985 is estimated to have amounted to SDR 13 billion, compared to SDR 23 billion at the end of 1984. At the end of 1985, adjustment programs sup- ported by stand-by or extended arrangements from the Fund, all in the upper credit tranches, were in effect in the following 17 countries that were identified as incurring payments arrears (including government defaults) during 1985: Argentina, Cen- tral African Republic, Costa Rica, Cote d'lvoire, Dominican Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Jamaica, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Senegal, Somalia, Yugoslavia, Zaire, and Zambia. All programs provided for a phased reduction or elimination of payments arrears (including govern- ment defaults) during a specified period as a performance criterion. Eight of these countries reduced, and three of them eliminated, payments arrears (including government defaults) by the end of 1985. In a number of adjustment programs, a counterpart deposit requirement in local currency was introduced as a means of maintaining a reliable record on payments arrears (including government defaults) and of monitoring the bona fides of foreign exchange applications. Multiple Currency Practices Article VIII, Section 3 of the Fund's Articles of Agreement prohibits a member from engaging in, or permitting its fiscal agencies to engage in, any 29 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS discriminatory currency arrangements or multiple currency practices without the approval of the Fund. Such practices may arise not only from the existence of separate exchange rates but also from the application of exchange taxes or subsidies, nonpayment of interest on advance import deposits and counterpart deposits against payments arrears, and broken cross rates. The Fund normally ap- proves multiple currency practices when a well- conceived plan is in place to bring about the unification of the multiple exchange rates or to abolish exchange measures giving rise to such practices during a specified and relatively short period of time. In many instances, the staff assists the authorities to formulate such a plan, especially in the context of adjustment programs supported by the use of Fund resources. In April 1984 and February 1985 the Executive Board reviewed the Fund's experience and policies with respect to multiple exchange rate regimes.7 In the context of a discussion in early 1985 of multiple currency practices applicable solely to capital trans- actions, the Executive Board did not adopt a view on the question of Fund jurisdiction over these practices under Articles VIII and XIV, leaving the matter open for further consideration. At the same time, it was agreed that members should continue to provide the Fund with specific and full information on capital controls and multiple currency practices applicable solely to capital transactions, and that the Fund will continue to assess the economic consequence of such practices in the context of its surveillance activities. The experience of the Fund membership with regard to practices that segment foreign exchange markets precisely on the basis of current and capital transactions has been limited; very few countries have multiple currency practices that are identified as relating solely to capital transactions.8 In most of these instances, these practices have not taken the form of a separate exchange rate for capital flows in general, but rather for specific components of the capital account, and they have served as an adjunct, and not as an alternative to, quantitative controls on other forms of capital transactions. Furthermore, the spreads 7For a detailed discussion of the former reviews, see Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions, 1985, pages 36-37; and 1981, pages 22-23. See also IMF Survey, Vol. 14, No. 13, June 24, 1985. 8Certain types of what might be considered, for statistical and related purposes, capital transactions (e.g., normal short- term banking and credit facilities and payments for amortiza- tion of loans or for depreciation of direct investments) are defined as current international transactions under the Fund's Article XXX. 30 have generally been maintained at a more or less steady depreciated rate over extended periods of time, have varied mainly in response to nonbal- ance of payments factors, or have been subject to infrequent discretionary change —all of which indicate that these practices have played a lim- ited "buffering" role for variations in capital movements. During 1985 there was an overall decline in the use of multiple currency practices by the devel- oping countries, following little change in 1984 and reversing the trend of increased use of multiple currency practices in the earlier part of the decade. Sixteen member countries eliminated or simplified multiple currency practices, while ten member countries introduced multiple currency practices. One member country introduced and eliminated a multiple currency practice in the course of the year. Multiple currency practices were eliminated in the seven member countries as follows. The Peo- ple's Republic of China eliminated an internal settlement rate applicable to trade transactions on January 1. In August Bolivia abolished an export retention scheme that was introduced in February and adopted a floating unitary exchange rate sys- tem. Ecuador abolished advance import deposit requirements in March. When Equatorial Guinea joined the Bank of Central African States (BEAC) on January 1, it eliminated the tax that had previously applied to transfers of net investment income. With effect also from January 1, Hungary began to adjust the exchange rate of its currency on a daily basis, thus eliminating the possibility of the emergence of a multiple currency practice in the form of broken cross rates arising from the previous practice of weekly rather than daily quotations. With effect from November 30, Nepal eliminated a revenue stamp duty on foreign exchange purchases and a cash export subsidy scheme, eliminating the multiple currency practices involved. Zaire, in June, eliminated the multiple currency practice arising from a 30 percent minimum mandatory deposit requirement for uncovered letters of credit. Multiple currency practices were simplified in nine countries during the period under review. Argentina eliminated a 10 percent rebate for non- traditional products in June, but reintroduced it for a few of these products in October. Brazil reduced the financial transactions tax to zero on sales of foreign exchange for imports of rice from mem- ber countries of the LAIA in January and on September 6 reduced it to zero on sales of foreign exchange for imports of salt products and rice for the remainder of 1985. The financial transactions ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES tax on sales of foreign exchange for imports of rice was also reduced to zero for the period September- November 1985. Colombia eliminated, in March, the 10 percent tax credit certificates (CERT) applying to exports to the member countries of the LAIA. Ecuador completed the unification of the official exchange market in November by changing the official exchange rate from S/. 66.50 = US$1 (buying) to S/. 95.00 = US$1. Only the transfer of surpluses generated by foreign oil companies dur- ing the period April-August 1985 is effected at the exchange rate of S/. 67.85 = US$1, irrespective of the official exchange rate that may prevail at the time of transfer. On Ju ly 11 Mexico abolished the "free exchange market" rate that was officially set but was managed by the commercial banks and that covered transactions not authorized through the "controlled market." On August 5 the controlled market began to operate on the basis of a managed floating system under which the exchange rate underwent daily adjustments. Parties eligible to participate in the controlled market may either choose to transact at an exchange rate agreed between those parties and the financial institutions authorized to operate in this market or at the "equilibrium exchange rate" of the day, to be determined at the fixing session held at the Bank of Mexico through a bidding process. In November Nepal eliminated revenue stamp duties on foreign exchange purchases and a cash export subsidy scheme. In February Nicaragua announced a modi- fication of the exchange system, which entailed an effective depreciation of the cordoba, the elimina- tion of mixing exchange rates for export proceeds and the exchange tax, and the introduction of new exchange rates, including a free exchange market for transactions not included in the official markets. New official exchange rates consisted of five fixed rates: C$10 = US$1; C$20 = US$1; C$28 = US$1; C$40 = US$1; and C$50 = US$1. Sudan reduced the number of its exchange markets to two in February: the official market, in which the exchange rate for the Sudanese pound was depre- ciated by 48 percent to LSd 2.50 = US$1; and a commercial bank market operated by authorized banks, in which authorized banks were permitted to set their own buying and selling rates for foreign currencies. The Syrian Arab Republic, in May, discontinued the practice of requiring most export proceeds to be surrendered partly at the official rate and partly at the parallel rate; with the exception of exports of petroleum and phosphate (effected at the official rate) and exports of fresh fruits and vegeta- bles (effected at the tourist rate), all other export products were effected at the parallel rate. Also, in September the Syrian Arab Republic replaced vary- ing rates of advance import deposit requirements for the private sector with a uniform 50 percent deposit requirement. During 1985 multiple currency practices were introduced in ten countries. In February Bolivia allowed private exporters to retain 30 percent (in the case of nontraditional products and mining cooperatives, 40 percent) of their export proceeds in foreign exchange to purchase imports or to convert them at the parallel exchange rate. This practice was eliminated in August when a floating unitary exchange rate was introduced. At the same time, Bolivia introduced a foreign exchange reim- bursement certificate equivalent to 10 percent of the amount of foreign exchange surrendered. These certificates were permitted to be used for foreign exchange purchases in the auction market or for the payment of the 10 percent deposit requirement for exports. The practice, since January 23, in the Dominican Republic of conducting official foreign exchange transactions at average buying and selling rates that have been determined by reference to the rates prevailing during the preceding five days gave rise, on occasion, to excessive exchange rate spreads. In October Guinea introduced a dual exchange rate system, with a second rate of GS 36 = Fl that represented a depreciation of 92 percent, compared with the exchange rate for the syli in the official market. The second rate was limited to sales to the banking system of foreign exchange originating from capital inflows, for investment, nonmining export receipts, grants, ex- penditures for tourist and business travel purposes, transfers, and sales of instruments of payments denominated in foreign exchange. In March Hon- duras introduced a scheme whereby transactions with the rest of the Central American countries are permitted to be effected through a secondary foreign exchange market. Export proceeds chan- neled through the Central American Clearing House, which previously had to be surrendered to the Central Bank, were permitted to be retained by exporters in special foreign currency-denominated deposits with commercial banks; and these deposits were permitted to be used by exporters to pay for their own imports of goods and services from the country from which the foreign exchange origi- nated, or be transferred for one time only to a third party at a freely determined exchange rate. During 1985 private importers in the Lao People's Demo- cratic Republic reorganized their activities into a joint cooperative venture with the mun ic ipa l i ty of 31 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS Vientiane, and foreign exchange was made avail- able to this organization at an exchange rate of KN 300 = US$1. As from January 1, Somalia permitted the shilling to float, on a temporary basis, for the bulk of private sector transactions. In September the Syrian Arab Republic introduced another exchange rate for medical and tourist expenditures abroad, thus widening the spread between the most appreciated and the most depre- ciated official exchange rates. On January 9 Trinidad and Tobago introduced a 10 percent tax on the sale of foreign exchange for vacation and business travel and on remittances to persons who had or were planning to emigrate from the country. The tax was eliminated in December when the exchange rate was adjusted from TT$2.40 = US$1 to TT$3.60 = US$1. The exchange rate of TT$2.40 = US$1, however, continued to apply to imports of essential goods (i .e ., food items, drugs, certain agricultural products, and school books). The Yemen Arab Republic permitted all exchange transactions, with the exception of certain govern- ment transactions, to take place in the official secondary market for foreign exchange in April. When Zambia introduced an auction system in October, expatriate remittances continued to be made during the period October 3 to end-December 1985 at the pre-auction exchange rate ruling on October 3. During 1985 six countries (The Bahamas, France, Italy, Lesotho, Mauritius, and South Af- rica) maintained multiple currency practices appli- cable solely to capital transactions. There have been no changes in the systems of these countries since 1984, with the exceptions of Lesotho and South Africa which reintroduced the dual exchange rate system that had been discontinued in 1983. Bilateral Payments Arrangements and Countertrade Practices The 1985 Annual Report on Exchange Ar- rangements and Exchange Restrictions noted that at the end of 1984 the total number of bilateral payments arrangements maintained between Fund members was 52, compared with 53 at the end of 1983, and that the total number of bilateral pay- ments agreements maintained between Fund mem- bers and non-Fund members was 84, remaining unchanged for the second consecutive year. During 1985 two bilateral payments agree- ments maintained between Fund members were terminated; in February the bilateral payments 32 agreement between Finland and Hungary was ter- minated, and in May the bilateral payments agree- ment between Ecuador and Romania was ter- minated. Consequently, as of the end of 1985, the total number of agreements maintained between Fund members declined by 2 to 50, while that of agreements between Fund members and non-Fund members remained unchanged at 84. Detailed information on the value of trade con- ducted under bilateral payments arrangements is not available for most Fund members maintaining such arrangements. On the assumption that the value of trade between Fund members maintaining bilateral payments agreements represents the max- imum value of trade conducted under bilateral payments arrangements, the total value of such trade is equivalent to about Vi of 1 percent of the value of world trade of Fund members. In recent years, as noted in the 1984 and 1985 issues of the Annual Report on Exchange Ar- rangements and Exchange Restrictions, there has been a growing resort in some countries to trading practices known as countertrade arrangements.9 These arrangements have taken a variety of forms, but basically they are barter or quasi-barter ar- rangements between private firms and/or govern- ment entities, such as foreign trade organizations, under which the seller is obligated to accept specified goods or services from the buyer. Even though countertrade arrangements are for the most part carried out by private firms without official sanction, several countries have recently issued guidelines to be followed by individual entities while engaging in countertrade, or regulations making countertrade mandatory for certain interna- tional transactions. The more common countertrade arrangements are known to have involved exchange of crude oil for manufactured goods. Some of the developing countries that have frequently engaged in countertrade arrangements include Argentina, Brazil, the People's Republic of China, Colombia, Greece, Guyana, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Jamaica, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Turkey, Venezuela, and Viet Nam. These and many other developing countries have concluded countertrade arrangements with private firms in the industrial countries or centrally planned Eastern European countries aimed at promoting exports of primary products (including crude oil), and in some 9In September 1982 the Executive Board reviewed the Fund's policy with respect to bilateral payments and counter- trade arrangements. The conclusions of that review were summarized in the Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions, 1983 (pages 44-^-5). ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES instances, servicing of external debt. Official re- quirements for countertrade are known to exist in some developing countries (Argentina, Colombia, and Indonesia). The emergence and recent growth of counter- trade may be attributed to several factors. In the centrally planned Eastern European countries, countertrade is often seen as supporting the central planning process by reducing the uncertainties for the domestic production plan that result from the difficulty in forecasting foreign demand. It is also a means of achieving bilateral balancing of trade, which is an important objective of foreign trade policy in most of these countries. Shortages of convertible foreign exchange and the desire to stimulate the inflow of technology from abroad have also motivated Eastern European countries to enter into countertrade arrangements. The balance of payments difficulties of developing countries in recent years have led some of these countries to seek new financing techniques, given their scarce foreign exchange resources. The pres- sures to find markets for surplus goods or the difficulties of gaining access to the markets of the industrial countries for certain primary and manufactured products have also prompted some developing countries to enter into countertrade arrangements that commit industrial country ex- porters to purchasing a given quantity of products over a specified period. In certain cases, counter- trade in the form of buy-back arrangements is seen—by both industrial and the more advanced developing countries—as a means of securing reliable sources of essential raw materials while exporting equipment and technology that have become outdated at home. In other cases, counter- trade may have become the only way for exporters (including those in industrial countries) to over- come the protective trade policies of some coun- tries, or to trade with centrally planned East European countries. Although the volume of trade conducted under countertrade arrangements does not appear to be large in relation to world trade,10 the proliferation of such practices is detrimental to the maintenance of the multilateral system of trade and payments. Countertrade practices may entail many of the undesirable restrictive and discriminatory practices traditionally associated with bilateralism. Where 10Global countertrade in 1980 was estimated to have been roughly about 1 percent of world trade; more recent estimates indicate that the percentage is now higher but is unlikely to exceed 10 percent. countertrade practices result from a direct govern- mental limitation on the use, availability, or trans- fer of exchange as such, they may entail exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to approval under Article VIII of the Fund's Articles of Agreement. Although countertrade practices may be viewed as having some temporary advantages, such as access to restricted markets, or in some circum- stances implicit valuation of exports at a more depreciated exchange rate, they have a number of shortcomings. Apart from the basic issue of in- efficiency of resource allocation, some of the more common serious disadvantages generally en- countered are: (1) a limited choice of products or services that are available for trading at internation- ally competitive prices; (2) poor quality of goods; (3) the difficulty of marketing products that are not directly consumed by the buyer, especially when the seller places geographical or commercial re- strictions on the marketing of products; and (4) a higher product cost resulting from payments of commissions or fees to the middleman handling sales of products and from bridge financing that may be required, owing to long delivery dates. Countertrade arrangements also tend to increase the cost of trade, as additional risks not usually present in normal bank-financed foreign trade must be covered. The use of countertrade has been proposed in some quarters as a means by which countries with heavy debt service burdens can improve their trade balances through access to markets where these are otherwise restricted. Such an approach might offer temporary access to markets for these countries, but additional export earnings can be used to service external debt only with mutual agreement of the parties concerned. Forfaiting is another practice that is often used to hedge against risks, including risk of non-payment, which cannot be covered by official export financ- ing schemes. Unlike countertrade, however, for- faiting represents an extension of traditional bank- ing practice to export financing. Forfaiting consists of discounting bills of exchange or promissory notes without recourse to the exporter. Although it may be used for all export transactions, in practice it has been applied mainly to exports of capital goods with credit terms of five to seven years maturity. The advantage for the exporter is that the commercial risk as well as the exchange rate and interest risks are transferred to the forfaiter. The alternative for the exporter is usually to finance exports at variable interest rates. Although forfait- ing was developed for exports to COMECON coun- 33 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS tries and certain Latin American countries, it is not used widely for trade with high-risk countries. Capital Controls Liberalization of international capital movements continued to take place in 1985 in both industrial and developing countries. For the group of indus- trial countries this liberalization represented contin- uation of a trend that has been apparent for several years, while for the developing country group it was the second year in succession of relaxation of capital controls. While in some industrial countries capital con- trols were relaxed in order to promote capital outflows and thus offset external current ac- count surpluses, in other countries the measures were motivated mainly by the desire to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of domestic finan- cial markets. The impact of dismantling capital controls was reinforced, in a number of industrial countries, by deregulation of domestic banking, changes in the tax treatment of capital transactions, and broadening of the range of permissible financial instruments. These developments have contributed to increased integration and competitiveness of international capital markets, and have also had the effect of encouraging other countries to consider changes in their regulations. In developing coun- tries, although the external financing situation of many countries remained as difficult in 1985 as in the previous year, the changes in capital regulations were predominantly in the direction of liberaliza- tion rather than intensification of restrictions. The liberalization measures in a few developing coun- tries were part of a general reform of the financial sector that had the aim of broadening and devel- oping financial markets by permitting foreign par- ticipation in the domestic market and residents' access to foreign markets. Some developing coun- tries, however, reacted to a strained balance of payments position by tightening restrictions, partic- ularly those affecting direct investment and the ability of residents to maintain foreign exchange deposits. During 1985 four industrial countries liberalized regulations affecting international transactions of commercial banks. The regulations related to capital inflows in the form of financial loans (Denmark and Italy), and to capital outflows to the Euro-yen market (Japan). In addition, Finland liberalized forward exchange market transactions. Liberalization also took place in eight developing 34 countries, including the removal of all controls on capital outflows (Bolivia); the removal of a sur- charge on foreign exchange earnings (Dominican Republic); the transfer of capital transactions from the official to the parallel foreign exchange market (Guatemala); the removal of discriminatory regula- tions for foreign banks (Korea); permission, subject to certain conditions, for residents to draw on commercial overdraft accounts abroad (Israel); the removal of a withholding tax on interest payments to nonresidents (Malaysia); transferability of capital accounts (Morocco); and the relaxation of permissi- ble foreign exchange holdings of commercial banks (Turkey). Only a few industrial countries adopted measures tightening regulations governing capital flows through commercial banks. Norway tightened regu- lations on bank loans denominated in foreign currencies. The United States, as part of a package of economic sanctions against South Africa, pro- hibited bank loans to the government of that country. Five developing countries tightened regu- lations for commercial banks' foreign operations, including a lengthening of permissible maturities on certain capital inflows and a shortening of permissi- ble maturities on certain capital outflows (Argen- tina); a tightening of approval procedures for money changers (Bahrain); a standstill arrangement for debt repayment (South Africa); the introduction of registration requirements for all foreign borrow- ing by the private sector (Thailand); and a reduction in limits on the net foreign asset position of banks (Zaire). On balance, regulations on resident and nonresi- dent foreign exchange accounts were liberalized in 1985. Two industrial countries relaxed such regula- tions affecting deposits with domestic banks (Den- mark) or with foreign banks (Norway); there was no tightening of regulations in this group of coun- tries. Four developing countries liberalized access by residents to foreign exchange deposit accounts (Greece, India, Nigeria, and Somalia); and Ghana liberalized regulations affecting both resident and nonresident accounts. Increased restrictions on foreign exchange accounts in this group of coun- tries took the form of increased reserve require- ments on foreign exchange deposits in Argentina, and suspension of the foreign exchange scheme that permitted residents and nonresidents to hold foreign exchange accounts in Jamaica. Restrictions on portfolio investments were lib- eralized in many industrial countries and in a few developing countries in 1985, while regulations were tightened only in Finland. The access of ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN REGIONAL ARRANGEMENTS residents to foreign securities was eased in Den- mark, France, Italy, and Norway. In Japan capital transactions in the Euro-yen market were promoted through relaxation of the standards for issuing Euro-yen bonds, liberalization of Euro-yen loans to nonresidents, a broadening of the instruments permitted in the market (e .g ., floating rate notes, dual currency bonds, currency conversion bonds, deep discount bonds, and zero-coupon bonds), and elimination of the withholding tax on interest income in Euro-yen bonds owned by nonresidents. Capital inflows through portfolio investments were liberalized in Italy and Spain. Restrictions on foreign banks' participation in the domestic capital market were eased in Japan and the Federal Re- public of Germany. In addition, the issue calendar for foreign bonds was suspended in the Federal Republic of Germany. Two developing countries (Korea and Singapore) relaxed regulations affecting portfolio investment. In the case of Korea, the measures were part of a policy aimed at developing the domestic capital market by permitting nonresi- dents to purchase domestic securities; in Singa- pore the measure concerned the treatment of tax privileges on income earned from loan syndication. In Finland the sale abroad of bonds and debentures quoted in the stock exchange was prohibited. Regulations concerning direct investment were liberalized in four industrial countries, and no industrial countries tightened such regulations. Regulations governing direct investment inflows were liberalized in Australia, Denmark, and France; and direct investment outflows were liberalized in Denmark and Italy. Among the developing countries, four countries (Ecuador, Korea, Malaysia, and Nigeria) liberalized regula- tions concerning direct investment. In all four cases, the liberalization related to capital inflows. In contrast to the general movement toward liberali- zation of direct investment in 1984 noted in that year's Report, one developing country introduced legislation that hampered direct investment inflows (Argentina). Gold As in recent years, very few regulations govern- ing ownership of and trade in gold were introduced. Australia announced on August 19 a range of economic sanctions against South Africa, including the prohibition of dealings in krugerrand. A bill authorizing the United States Treasury to mint gold coins was signed by the President on December 17, 1985. In December 1985 the Foreign Exchange Board of Sweden abolished the prohibition on imports and exports of unworked gold, certain gold products, and gold coins, thus ending the regulation of trade in gold. South Africa amended certain regulations concerning transactions in gold. The premiums on krugerrand sold by the company "Intergold" to local distributors were reduced. As an interim measure, the Reserve Bank decided on January 29 to pay the gold mines in U .S. dollars for only 50 percent of their sales; the rest would be settled in rand. On December 9 a new regulation required payments to gold mines for gold purchases to be effected in rand and not partly in U .S. dollars as previously arranged. IV. Main Developments in Regional Arrangements Several measures to foster regional cooperation were taken in 1985. Prominent among these were the preparations for the entry of Portugal and Spain into the EC.11 In March member countries of the EC agreed on issues concerning entry terms for Portugal and Spain. A treaty governing both coun- tries' accession was signed on June 12, and their membership became effective on January 1, 1986. Integration into the EC is being governed by a series of transitional arrangements. As regards industrial products, a seven-year timetable was 11 Prior to the January 1, 1986 enlargement, membership comprised Belgium, Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Nether- lands, and the United Kingdom. established for the enlarged EC membership to achieve a phased, reciprocal dismantling of tariffs on industrial products and alignment of external tariffs. A transition period of up to ten years was adopted for Portugal for its implementation of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).12 Other EC members will phase out most duties on Portu- guese agricultural exports over six to eight years, and the financial resources of the EC will be made available to Portugal for agricultural development projects. Portugal will also be permitted to maintain certain quantitative import restrictions vis-a-vis both third countries and other EC members in the 12For a relatively small number of products, the transition period is to be completed in seven years. 35 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS transition period; and similarly, other EC members will be permitted to maintain certain restrictions on imports from Portugal. However, all import restric- tions that had been maintained by Portugal for balance of payments purposes were eliminated, effective January 1, 1986. Payments associated with current transactions were to be fully liberalized on accession, with the exception of tourism allow- ances, which may be subject to restriction up to end-1990. Certain restrictions on capital outflows may continue up to end-1990, including regulations governing outflows of a personal nature, the repatri- ation of profits on property investments, and the limits on subscriptions to bond issues by the European Investment Bank or the EC; liberalization of some direct investment to other member coun- tries may be postponed until December 1992. As regards investment in Portugal by residents of other member states, liberalization in respect of some transfers for buildings or land may be postponed until end-1990 (although a prior authorization scheme will end by end-1989). In the case of Spain, implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy is expected to be largely completed within a seven-year period, although the transition period will last ten years for fresh fruits and vegetables and vegetable oils. Most nontariff barriers between Spain and the EC were to be eliminated upon accession. However, Spain will maintain quantitative restrictions for three years on imports of color televisions and certain farm trac- tors, and for four years on certain cotton textiles and a limited number of other products. The EC can also maintain quantitative restrictions for four years on certain textile imports from Spain. Removal of quantitative restrictions will be phased over the respective periods. Spanish steel exports to the EC will continue to be limited for three years, during which period Spain will phase out state aid for steel. EC financial resources will be placed at Spain's disposal to facilitate the process of agricul- tural and industrial restructuring implied by the integration. With some exceptions, Portugal and Spain will apply the same treatment to each other as they apply to other members of the EC. In 1985 the EC held ongoing negotiations with nonmember Mediterranean countries,13 with a view to adapting existing preferential agreements to the enlarged EC so as to ensure that traditional trading patterns are maintained. On December 8, 1984 a 13Maghreb countries: Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia; Mas- hreq countries: Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria; and Cyprus, Israel, Malta, and Yugoslavia. 36 new EC-ACP convention (Lome III) was signed by representatives of the EC and 65 countries of the African, Caribbean, and Pacific States.14 The new convention is to run for five years starting March 1, replacing Lome II, which expired on February 28. However, as Lome III did not come into force until May 1, 1986, transitional arrangements were made to allow use of the money still left under Lome II. Lome III has provisions similar to its predecessor agreement for development aid, special trading arrangements (including duty-free access for virtu- ally all ACP country exports to the EC, except those covered by the CAP), and a system for stabilizing export earnings. The new convention emphasizes the development of specific sectors, particularly agriculture, and the promotion of in- vestment. Pending the entry into force of the new convention, which requires ratification by ten EC member states and two thirds of the ACP member states, transitional arrangements were adopted on February 22, extending some of the provisions of Lome II. Angola, which had taken part in the negotiation of the convention, became a signatory on April 30. As of December 31, instruments of ratification had been deposited by 31 ACP states and 3 EC members. On July 23 the EC and Pakistan signed a new commercial, economic, and devel- opment cooperation agreement replacing a 1976 agreement. The new agreement will result in expanded cooperation, especially in areas of tech- nology and joint research. In November a trade, economic, and development cooperation agree- ment was signed by the EC, members of the Cen- tral American Common Market (CACM),15 and Panama, designed to strengthen regional integration and foster economic and social development in Central America. 14The 65 ACP states associated with the EC are divided into the following categories by Lome" III: (1) the least-developed countries—Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Djibouti, Dominica, Ethiopia, The Gambia, Grenada, Guinea, Guinea- Bissau, Kiribati, Lesotho, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Rwanda, St. Lucia, Sao Tom6 and Principe, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Somalia, Sudan, Swaziland, Tan- zania, Togo, Tonga, Tuvalu, Uganda, and Western Samoa; (2) the island and landlocked countries—Antigua and Barbuda, The Bahamas, Barbados, Equatorial Guinea, Fiji, Jamaica, Madagascar, Mauritius, Papua New Guinea, St. Christopher and Nevis, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, Vanuatu, Zaire, Zambia, and Zimbabwe; (3) others— Belize, Cameroon, People's Republic of the Congo, Cote d'lvoire, Gabon, Ghana, Guyana, Kenya, Liberia, Mozam- bique, Nigeria, Senegal, and Suriname.

Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN REGIONAL ARRANGEMENTS Following an initial round of exploratory discus- sions in November 1984, contacts between the EC and the Cooperation Council16 for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC) were intensified during 1985. At a ministerial meeting held on October 14 in Luxem- bourg, the two sides stated that talks on cooperation should progress to a new and more active stage, with a view to the signing of a comprehensive commercial and economic cooperation agreement. A subsequent meeting of the GCC in October focused on ways to coordinate customs and tariffs policies among member states. Participants also discussed the possibility of establishing a unified stock market among GCC member countries, and a subcommittee was established to study problems of intraregional trade. As a result of its accession to the EC, Portugal withdrew from the European Free Trade Associa- tion (EFTA),17 effective December 31. EFTA will continue to accord duty-free access to imports of industrial products from Portugal, but duty-free status will no longer apply to a few nonindustrial products, such as tomato puree and tinned sardines, which were formerly treated as industrial products. Some bilateral agreements between Portugal and EFTA members, which eliminated duties on certain agricultural products, will also be allowed to lapse. As regards Spain's accession to the EC, EFTA has maintained that Spanish imports from EFTA should be accorded the same treatment during the transi- tional seven-year period as that country's imports from the EC. EFTA rejected the EC's request that EFTA countries grant zero duties on imports of Spanish industrial goods from the date of accession. After having been an associate member of EFTA since 1961, Finland became a fu ll member on January 1, 1986. The change is expected to have little impact on trading patterns, since all tariffs on industrial goods between Finland and EFTA were abolished in 1967. On November 30 Ireland became the nine- teenth member of the Development Aid Committee (DAC) of the OECD. The purpose of the DAC is to encourage growth in development aid and improve its efficiency. The annual summit meeting of the Economic Community of West African States (EcowAS)18 was held in Ju ly 1985, in Lome, Togo.

The agreement, which was to take effect on July 1, 1985, would have granted residential rights to individuals anywhere in the ECOWAS for the next five years. The meeting also adopted a decision establishing an ECOWAS travel certificate for member states and a convention for the tempo- rary importation of passenger vehicles into member states. ECOWAS member states have stepped up moves to develop a common currency system. The first report of the "study commission on the mone- tary zone" was presented to ECOWAS central bank- ers in May 1984. The study group is to present its final report to ECOWAS heads of state in Lagos in May 1986. Member countries of the Preferential Trade Area of Eastern and Southern African States (PTA)19 expressed the aim of establishing a common market over the next five years in line with the Lagos Plan of Action. In June 1985 the PTA's agricultural ministers agreed on an action program for the agricultural sector through 1990. In September the members adopted a ten-point resolution to speed up trade and economic development in eastern and southern Africa. The aim of the resolution is to bring the PTA closer to its main objective of establishing itself as a fu l ly fledged economic commission by 1992. A new PTA trade and development bank for the eastern and south- ern countries, with headquarters in Bujumbura, Burundi, was scheduled to begin operations in January 1986. The bank's initial capital is 60 mil- lion PTA units of account, two thirds of which is capital subscribed by member states. Financial institutions from member countries will provide financial and technical assistance.

The AfDB is to act as the depository and administering agency for the emergency relief fund of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), founded in September 1984. Angola and Tanzania became members of the Organization of Southern African Telecommunica- tions Administration (SATA).21 The nine members agreed to coordinate the use of broadcast frequen- cies among SATA members. At the eighteenth Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)22 held in Bangkok, Thailand, on April 30- May 2, the Board of Governors agreed on a fifth replenishment proposal to provide sufficient re- sources to cover the Bank's concessional lending for the four-year period 1987-90. The seventh meeting of economic ministers of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)23 was held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on February 7 —9. The ministers initialed an agree- ment on the recognition of domestic driving li- censes in ASEAN countries, with a view to facili- tating and increasing intra-ASEAN tourism. As a further step toward improving trade cooperation, the ministers approved the application of 25 percent across-the-board tariff cuts in place of the present 20-25 percent Margins of Preference levels on all items with import values above US$10 million.

On July 11-13 foreign ministers of the ASEAN countries met with their counterparts from Aus- tralia, Canada, the EC, Japan, New Zealand, and the United States in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. At the meeting, the ASEAN ministers expressed con- cern over tariff and nontariff barriers affecting their exports of manufactured and semimanufactured goods to the developed countries, and over the decline of foreign investment flows to the ASEAN region in recent years. The first ministerial meeting between ASEAN and the EC devoted exclusively to economic affairs took place on October 17-18 in Bangkok. A working committee was established to examine ways to increase investment flows from the EC to ASEAN member countries. A new ASEAN Committee on Energy Cooperation (COEC) was established to deal with energy mat- ters, and the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand agreed, in principle, to buy oil from their oil producing neighbors—Malaysia, Brunei, and In- donesia—if the export levels of those countries fell below 80 percent of the amount they normally export. At a January ministerial level meeting of the Indian Ocean Commission,24 a decision was taken to admit the Comoros and France to the organiza- tion; France will normally be represented by partici- pants from Reunion. The reform of the Central American Tariff and Customs Regime, which was signed by Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua in Decem- ber 1984, was ratified by the governments of these countries in 1985 and implemented on January 1, 1986. During 1985 the Latin American Integration Association25 explored a possible new mechanism for financing interregional trade to counter in- creased pressures toward bilateralism and counter- trade practices among its members; two existing mechanisms for the multilateral settlement of bal- ances among LAIA members had proved ineffec- tive.

Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN REGIONAL ARRANGEMENTS Commission for Latin America and the Carib- bean (ECLAC)26 was held in Santiago, Chile, on March 4-6. The meeting examined the prospects of regional and interregional cooperation in the field of production and provisioning of equipment for the generation and transmission of electrical energy. A seminar on the Strengthening of Links Between the Federation of Saving and Credit Cooperatives of the Central American Isthmus was organized by the Mexico sub-office of ECLAC, and was held in Mexico City on February 28 and March 1. ECLAC and the Regional Centre for Third World Studies (CRESET) agreed to develop a cooperation pro- gram during the visit of the Director of CRESET to ECLAC headquarters on March 11-15. A further meeting of ECLAC was held from April 29 to May 3 to discuss the difficult economic situation faced by most countries of the region, including reconciliation of economic objectives with social ones. The question of indebtedness of the countries in this region was a subject of special attention at a meeting of ECLAC held in Buenos Aires on August 21-23. During 1985 members of the Caribbean Commu- nity (CARicoM)27 continued the process of imple- menting an arrangement reached in July 1984 to establish a common external tariff aimed at revers- ing the decline in intraregional trade and stimulat- ing the expansion of manufacturing output and trade within the CARICOM. The new arrange- ments include common tariffs on a list of "sensi- tive" goods from outside the region and a disman- tling of protectionist barriers by some members. At the annual meeting of the CARICOM held in Bridgetown, Barbados in Ju ly, members examined the problem of a downturn in regional economic activity in the face of general global economic expansion. Although no agreement was reached on finding ways to revise the US$100 million Carib- bean Multilateral Clearing Facility (CMCF), a major obstacle to progress was removed when Guyana, the main CMCF debtor, agreed on a repayment formula. Guyana is to make some repayments to Barbados, and the proceeds of sugar sales it makes within CARICOM will be used to settle its CMCF debts. Guyana is to host the next CARICOM summit in July 1986. 26Members are Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, The Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, France, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, St. Christopher and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Spain, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uruguay, and Venezuela.

Not for Redistribution This page intentionally left blank ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PART TWO ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution This page intentionally left blank ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part Two Part Two gives a detailed description of the exchange and trade system of ind iv idual member countries, includ- ing a nonmetropolitan territory (Hong Kong ), for wh ich the United Kingdom has accepted the Fund 's Articles of Agreement, and the Netherlands An t i l le s, wh i ch is a part of the Kingdom of the Ne ther lands. The exchange and trade system of one other country, wh ich is not a member of the Fund, is also described. In general, the description relates to the exchange and trade systems as at the end of 1985, but in appropriate cases reference is made to significant developments that took place early in 1986. A standardized approach has been fo l lowed, under which the description of each system is broken down into similar headings, and the coverage for each country includes a final section that lists chronologically the more significant changes during 1985. The description of the restrictive system is not necessarily confined to those aspects invo lv ing exchange restrictions or exchange controls. As in previous Re- ports, questions of def in i t ion and ju r isd ic t ion have not been raised, and an attempt has been made to describe restrictive systems in their en t ire ty, except for the tar iff structure and, in most cases, direct taxes on exports and imports. Thus, the coverage extends to such features as import licensing, advance deposit requirements, import surcharges, travel taxes, export licensing, and export incentive schemes. S im i la r ly, the section "Changes During 1985" includes references to certain devel- opments that may have a direct impact on international transactions but are not necessarily reflected in the body of the country descriptions, such as major revisions of import tariffs or developments in regional cooperation. The description given in the section Exchange Ar- rangement is in line w i th the notification of exchange arrangements that member countries have furn ished to the Fund under A r t ic le IV, Section 2(a). The s t r u c t u re of exchange markets is described, and the o f f ic ial exchange rate is given. The rates quoted are those effective on December 31, 1985, unless stated otherwise. Under Administration of Control, some ind ica t ion is given of the authorities responsible for policy and administration of the controls and of the ex tent to wh ich their powers are delegated for working purposes. The section on Prescription of Currency describes the requirements affecting the selection of the currency and method of settlement for transactions w i th other coun- tries. Where a country has concluded paymen ts agree- ments with other countries, the terms of these agree- ments often lead to prescription of the currency for specified categories of payments to and from the coun- tries concerned. The countries w i th wh i ch bilateral payments agreements are in force are listed e i ther in the text or in a footnote. Under Nonresident Accounts, a description is g iven of the manner in which the country treats accounts, if any, maintained in its currency by account holders who are not regarded as resident in that coun try, and the f a c i l i t i es and limitations attached to such accounts. Where there is more than one type of nonresident account, the na ture and operation of the various types are also described. In the section on Imports and Import Payments, import licensing requirements are described b r ie f ly, and details are given of other requirements imposed on payments for imports and of any advance deposit requ iremen ts. The term "open general license" indicates arrangements whereby certain imports or other international transac- tions are exempt from the restrictive application of licensing requirements, in contrast to an " ind iv idual license," wh ich may be given either f ree ly, or restric- tively, according to administrative decisions. Under Payments for Invisibles, the procedures for permitting payments abroad for current transactions in invisibles are described br ief ly, together w i th any l im i ta- tions on the export of foreign and domestic bank notes. For some countries that do not impose l im i ta t ions on payments for inv is ib les, th is section is combined w i th the section on Proceeds from Inv is ib les (see below). Export licensing requirements and procedures are described under Exports and Export Proceeds, w i th an outline of the requirements that may be imposed on the hand l ing of proceeds from exports. The expression "exchange receipts must be surrendered" indicates that the recipient is required by the regu la t ions to sell any foreign exchange proceeds in return for local currency, usua l ly at the official rate, to the central bank or to a commercial bank or exchange dealer authorized for th is purpose. In some countries there is a requ irement that such exchange or part thereof be sold in a free ma rke t. Under Proceeds from Invisibles, any regulations gov- erning exchange derived from transactions in invisibles are given, and any limitations on the import of foreign and domestic bank notes are described. The coverage under Capital describes the special arrangements or l im i ta t ions attached to in terna t ional capital movements. Where regulations on foreign capital also cover the income thereon, they are u sua l ly dealt w i th in this section rather than in the sections on Payments for Invisibles and Proceeds from Inv is ib les. The section on Gold gives a summary of the principal regulations that govern the holding, negotiation, import, and export of gold coin and gold in other forms. In this Report, references to "Taiwan" are to the Taiwan Province of Ch ina. 75 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution This page intentionally left blank ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution AFGHANISTAN (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Afghanistan is the Afghani. Da Afghanistan Bank (the central bank) maintains an official rate applied to (a) foreign exchange proceeds from exports of cotton; (b) transactions for the Central Government; (c) certain foreign currency income earned in Afghanistan (see Proceeds from Invisibles, below); and (d) all transactions in accounting units specified under bilateral payments agreements. The official ex- change rate is defined in terms of the U .S. dollar and is flexible. On December 31, 1985, the official exchange rate was Af 50.0 = US$1 buy ing and Af 51.2 = US$1 selling. Certain other exchange rates have been estab- lished to provide incentives for particular exports; for these products a portion of export proceeds can be surrendered at a rate more depreciated than the official rate but generally less advantageous than the legal bazaar rate. All karakul export proceeds must be surrendered and are eligible for conversion at a rate of Af 150 = £ 1; 70 percent of wool export proceeds must be surrendered and are eligible for conversion at a rate of Af 120 = US$1; and 18 percent of the proceeds from raisin exports to bilateral countries, which are required to be received in convertible currencies and surrendered, are eligible for exchange at Af 130 = US$1. In addition, the convertible foreign exchange purchased by Da Afghani- stan Bank from enterprises and from raisin exports is sold to public enterprises at a rate that is Af 1 less than the rates applicable to purchases; if the central bank is unable to provide foreign currency to the public enter- prises at these favorable rates, the enterprise may, as a last resort, purchase the required exchange from the bazaar. Transactions that are not required to be effected with the banks may take place at the legal bazaar rate. Exports other than those mentioned above can be sold to the banks at rates near the bazaar rate. There is also a legal bazaar rate in which workers' remittances are sold and various capital flows are transacted; on Decem- ber 31, 1985 the bazaar rate was Af 136.88 = US$1. Da Afghanistan Bank posts rates for deutsche marks, French francs, Indian rupees, Pakistan rupees, pounds sterling, and Swiss francs. Da Afghanistan Bank charges commissions ranging from 0.10 percent to 0.375 percent on exchange transactions. Administration of Control Foreign exchange transactions are controlled by the Government through Da Afghanistan Bank. The control is facilitated by the existence of relatively large compa- nies specializing in the export of such commodities as karakul, cotton, wool, and carpets. However, these companies do not exercise a monopoly over the export of such commodities, except for cotton, whose export is reserved for four authorized companies. Prescription of Currency Settlements with countries with which Afghanistan has bilateral payments agreements1 must be made in bilateral accounting dollars in accordance with the procedures set forth in those agreements. The proceeds from exports of wool and karakul to all countries must be obtained in convertible currencies. There are no other prescription of currency requirements. Imports and Import Payments Imports are not subject to license, but import transac- tions must be registered before orders are placed abroad. Imports of a few items (e .g ., some drugs, liquor, arms, and ammunition) are prohibited on grounds of public policy or for security reasons; in some instances, however, special permission to import these goods may be granted. The importation of certain other goods (e.g., a few textiles and selected nonessential consumer goods) also is prohibited. There are no quantitative restrictions on other imports. Most bilateral agreements, however, specify quantities (and sometimes prices) for com- modities to be traded. An annual import program is drawn up by the Ministry of Commerce, covering imports of both the public and private sectors. Adjust- ments in the public sector import plan are made in the light of changing circumstances. The import plan for the private sector, drawn up on the basis of proposals submitted by the Chamber of Commerce, is indicative. Importation of petroleum products and sugar is a state monopoly. The present customs tariff structure was promulgated in June 1974 and has since then been modified in the annual budgets. Actual tariff rates, ad valorem and specific, vary considerably. Ad valorem duties usually range between 20 percent and 35 percent. Payments for imports through the banking system to payments agreement countries may usually be made only under letters of credit. Payments to other countries may be made under letters of credit, against bills for collec- tion, or against an undertaking by the importer to import goods at least equivalent to the payment made through the banking system. With the exception of certain public sector imports, a deposit of up to 40 percent of the c . i .f. value is required by banks upon opening of a letter of credit. Foreign exchange for payments for imports by the private sector has to be acquired in the bazaar market. Payments for Invisibles Tourists are permitted to take out up to US$2,000 or the equivalent in other foreign currencies, and traders can take out up to US$15,000 for imports of goods.

Not for Redistribution AFGHANISTAN When foreign travel is for other purposes, the permissi- ble amounts are determined by the appropriate authori- ties in each case. Permission from the central bank or one of the commercial banks is necessary for taking out foreign currency. Exchange for private travel, as for other private purposes, has to be acquired in the bazaar market. The fee for a passport valid for one year is Af 20,000 for tourist travel and Af 1,000 to Af 2,500 for other types of travel. Export of foreign currency notes up to US$2,000 or its equivalent by travelers is permitted only if the foreign exchange has been bought from the banking system. Travelers are not allowed to take out more than Af 2,000 in domestic bank notes and Af 50 in coins. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports (other than gold) are not subject to license, but export transactions must be registered. Exports of a few commodities (e.g., opium and museum pieces) are prohibited. Otherwise, control is exercised only over exports to bilateral agreement countries (see section on Imports and Import Payments, above). Proceeds from exports of karakul and wool to all countries, including payments agreement countries, are received in convert- ible currencies. Receipts from exports of natural gas, karakul, cotton, and wool are subject to surrender requirements at the official rate. Other exports to the convertible currency area may be: (a) sold at rates near the market rate to other importers for the import of 33 permitted products; (b) retained abroad by the exporter for 8, 10, or 12 months, depending on the destination of the exports, and used for the imports of goods not on the prohibited list; and (c) transferred to a foreign currency account with a bank in Afghanistan and used by the exporter, or sold to another importer only for importation of 33 specified items. Da Afghanistan Bank buys foreign exchange from exports to bilateral payments agreement countries, but there is no obligation to surrender foreign exchange to the banks. Eighteen percent of proceeds from exports of raisins to the U .S .S .R. under contracts signed in 1984 are receivable in convertible currency. Proceeds from Invisibles Sixty percent of the foreign currency salaries of foreign employees working in the Afghan public and private sectors must be converted into Afghanis at the official rate. Travelers entering Afghanistan are required to spend a minimum of the equivalent of US$26 per day in foreign exchange. They may bring in any amount of foreign currency but must declare it when entering the country if they intend to take out any residue when leaving the country, subject to the above minimum conversion requirement. Travelers may bring in no more than Af 2,000 in Afghan banknotes and Af 50 in Afghan coins. Capital Foreign investment in Afghanistan requires prior approval and is administered by an Investment Commit- tee. The Foreign and Domestic Private Investment Law of 1353 (issued on July 4, 1974) provides for a number of benefits, which include (1) income tax exemption for four years (six years outside Kabul province), beginning from the date of the first sales of products resulting from the new investment; (2) exemption from import duties on essential imports (mainly of capital goods); (3) exemp- tion from taxes on dividends for four years after the first distribution of dividends, but not more than seven years after the approval of the investment; (4) exemption from personal income and corporate taxes on interest on foreign loans that constitute part of an approved invest- ment; (5) exemption from export duties, provided that the products are permitted to be exported; and (6) man- datory purchases by government agencies and depart- ments of their requirements from enterprises established under the law where prices of such products are not more than 15 percent higher than prices of foreign supplies. The law provides that foreign investment in Afghanistan can only take place through joint ventures, with foreign participation not exceeding 49 percent. It also establishes that an investment approved by the Investment Commit- tee shall require no further license in order to operate in Afghanistan. Payments of principal and interest on loans from abroad may be remitted freely to the extent of the legal obligation involved. Profits may be repatriated freely, and capital may be repatriated after five years at an annual rate not exceeding 20 percent of the total registered capital. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell domes- tically gold in any form. Imports of gold are restricted. Exports of gold bullion and silver, as well as of jewelry, require permission of Da Afghanistan Bank and the Ministry of Finance. Commercial exports of gold and silver jewelry and of other articles containing minor quantities of gold or silver do not require a license and may be made freely. Customs duties are payable on imports and exports of silver in any form unless the import or export is made by or on behalf of the monetary authorities. Changes During 1985 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 78 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ALGERIA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Algeria is the Algerian Dinar. Daily buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar, the interven- tion currency, and other specified currencies1 are estab- lished by the Central Bank of Algeria on the basis of a fixed relationship between the dinar and a composite of currencies. The currencies included in the composite and their weights take into account the relative importance of payments, including capital transactions, that are made in these currencies. A margin of DA 0.015 has been established between the buying and selling rates of the dinar in terms of the U.S. dollar. An encouragement premium is granted on the conversion of convertible currencies repatriated by Algerians working abroad. Up to February 1983, the premium was adjusted so as to ensure that the exchange rate for such remittances was DA 1 = F 1; thereafter, the amount of the premium has been determined periodically by a decree of the Ministry of Finance. On each trip to Algeria, Algerians gainfully employed abroad are required to exchange an amount of convertible currency equivalent to DA 700 at the exchange rate operative on the day the transaction takes place. They receive the incentive premium only on those conversions or transfers that are not required of them by law or regulation. On December 31, 1985 the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were DA 4.7653 = US$1 and DA 4.7803 = US$1, respectively. The foreign exchange reserves are centralized in the Central Bank; authorized banks must clear their foreign currency position with their foreign correspondents at the end of each day but, under certain conditions, they are permitted to hold cover for documentary credits outside Algeria. There are no forward exchange facilities. Administration of Control The Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank have general jurisdiction over exchange control. The Central Bank assists in the formulation of the exchange legisla- tion and regulations and is responsible for their applica- tion by the authorized banks. Authority over many exchange control procedures has been delegated to five commercial banks and the Postal Administration. Import and export licenses and global import quotas are issued by the Ministry of Commerce within the limits of a general import program. Import and export licenses require the visa of the Central Bank. Investment of foreign capital in excess of DA 500,000 in Algeria requires approval by a National Investment Committee in order to obtain the benefits of the Investment Code. Prescription of Currency Settlements with countries with which no payments agreements are in force are made in convertible curren- cies.2 Payments under foreign supply contracts (contrats de fournitures) can be made in either the currency in use at the headquarters of the supplier or that of the country of origin of the merchandise. Foreign holders of servic- ing contracts are required to open local nonresident accounts to which payments are made by the Algerian contracting party; such accounts must be closed within six months from the end of the contract, beyond which date outward transfers of the funds or their use for purposes unrelated to the contracts are not permitted. Nonresident Accounts Most nonresident accounts are Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dinars or Internal Nonresident Accounts. There are at present four types of accounts, as follows: 1. Individual Suspense Accounts may be opened without authorization and may be credited with pay- ments from any country. Balances in such accounts opened prior to January 1, 1975 by nonresident physical persons of foreign nationality have been released for transfer abroad. 2. Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dinars (CEDAC accounts) may be opened by individuals or juridical persons of foreign nationality, including those under supply or servicing contract arrangements. Such ac- counts may be credited only with deposits that, under the regulations applicable when the deposit is made, are free from any restrictions on transfer. They may not be credited with amounts that are transferable to the bilateral area. They may be debited for payments to any foreign country, for payments in Algeria, or for the provision of foreign bank notes that the account holder intends to export when he travels abroad. These accounts bear interest and may not show a net debt position. 3. Final Departure Accounts may be opened, without prior authorization, in the name of any physical person residing in Algeria, not of Algerian nationality, who intends to leave Algeria to return to the country of origin. These accounts may be credited freely with an amount equivalent to the holdings on October 20, 1963 in the account of the person concerned; with the proceeds from sales of real estate of the account holder, provided that the funds are paid directly by a notary public; with the proceeds of the sale of securities through a bank; and with any other payments, up to DA 2,000. These accounts may be debited without prior approval for certain payments in Algeria on behalf of the account holder. Outward transfers require individual approval. 1 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Netherlands guil- ders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. 2Specified noncommercial settlements with Morocco and Tunisia are channeled through a dirham account at the Bank of Morocco and an account in Tunisian dinars at the Central Bank of Tunisia. 79 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ALGERIA Emigrant workers may maintain certain accounts in Algeria that are credited with the proceeds from the conversion of convertible currencies (comptes epargne- devises). Depositors receive an incentive premium equivalent to 40 percent of the buying exchange rate on the conversion date of such foreign exchange. 4. Foreign Currency Accounts are held by physical or juridical Algerian nationals, who may be either nonresi- dents or persons who have resided for more than six months in a foreign country. Such accounts may be freely credited with (a) book transfers from abroad using either postal or banking facilities, (b) imported convert- ible foreign currencies which have been declared at the account holder's entry in the country, and (c) domestic bank-to-bank book transfers. The accounts may be freely debited for book transfers abroad but only through the banking system; they may also be debited for purchases of dinars, for book transfers in dinars, and for purchases of convertible foreign currencies to be physically ex- ported by the account holder. A conversion premium is received on any amount drawn and used for payment of expenses in the country, with the exception of legal payment obligations. The interest rate payable on de- posits in these accounts is fixed annually by the Minister of Finance. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Certain imports are prohibited regardless of origin. Law No. 78-02 of February 11, 1978 gives the Government a monopoly over foreign trade. All imports are permitted, in principle, in accordance with an annual import program. This is implemented mainly through global import authorizations (autorisations globales d' importa- tion, or AGI) granted to public enterprises. There are five types of import authorizations: (1) AGI Monopole, issued to enterprises holding monopoly rights to import specified commodities; (2) AGI de fonctionnement in- terne, issued to individual enterprises for import require- ments relating to their production activity; (3) AGI objectif planifie', issued to enterprises for imports relating to their investment program; (4) AGI (sans paiemenf), under which exemption from all exchange control formalities is granted to transactions not involving use of official foreign exchange or local currency or any other counterparts; and (5) AGI (sans transfer), issued to enterprises for specified import products (classified as consumable products—matieres consommables) utilized in public works contracts; simplified exchange and trade control formalities applied to such transactions. In addition, Algerian nationals may import by postal parcel and against reimbursement, free of trade and exchange control formalities, a number of specified goods, pro- vided the value does not exceed DA 1,000 in each case. Special regulations apply to imports of a noncommer- cial character, and for imports without payment of new equipment not destined for resale, as well as to auto- mobiles for personal use. Imports not destined for resale may be made free of exchange and trade controls up to a 80 value of DA 10,000. New equipment goods can also be imported without use of official exchange and free of exchange and trade control formalities, provided that (a) the value in each case does not exceed DA 200,000, and (b) the goods are not for resale; the list of goods that can be thus imported is established from time to time by ministerial decree. Domestic residents can obtain an authorization to import, without use of official exchange and free of exchange and trade control formalities, an automobile for personal use. All imports must be domiciled with an authorized bank, to which the necessary import documents must be presented and through which all payments related to the transaction must be made. Without a waiver from the exchange control authority (the Ministry of Finance or the Central Bank), advance payments may not exceed 15 percent of the import value. In accordance with Law No. 80-07 of August 3, 1980, imports must be insured domestically. In the case of urgent or exceptional import expenditures by public agencies, public enterprises, and ministerial departments, the domiciliary banks for the import payments may effect payment before completion of the trade and exchange control formalities. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles to all countries require the approval of the Central Bank. When supporting docu- ments are presented, however, approval may be granted by authorized banks, or sometimes by the Postal Admin- istration, either freely or up to specified limits for certain payments, such as (1) those relating to approved trade transactions and maritime contracts, (2) travel expenses, (3) transfers of salaries and wages, (4) educational expenses, and (5) advertising expenses. For payments for which the approval authority has not been delegated, the granting of exchange must be authorized by either the Central Bank or the Ministry of Finance. Certain public enterprises, which receive special exchange allocations (budget devises), may use these freely for payments for specified invisibles, including transportation and other services contracted abroad. The transfer of family remittances is suspended. Insurance on all risks arranged in Algeria by Algerian residents must be purchased in Algeria. Private national exporters may open ED AC accounts (i.e., exporters convertible dirham accounts) denominated in convertible dinars, which can be credited by up to 4 percent of repatriated proceeds and be used for any of the following payments: business travel allow- ances; air travel expenditures; salaries and expenditures of foreign technicians; imports of essential spare parts and capital goods amounting to less than DA 200,000; representations at overseas trade fairs and exhibitions; and legal and administrative expenses. Residents of other countries working in Algeria under the programs for technical cooperation or for public enterprises and agencies or for certain mixed companies may transfer abroad a percentage of their net salaries, as follows: 50 percent for single persons and married persons whose families are in Algeria; and 70 percent for ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution persons whose families are abroad. For other workers who have contracts with other employers and hold the necessary employment documents, the amounts that may be transferred are 35 percent for single persons and married persons whose families are in Algeria and 55 percent for persons whose families are abroad. The payments must be transferred once a month on the basis of the remuneration for the previous month. Persons making such transfers are not entitled to allocations for other personal transfers. For resident nationals and individuals of foreign nationality in resident status (excluding those having an entitlement to make transfers) traveling by air or sea to foreign countries, including countries in the French Franc Area, other than for medical reasons, the foreign exchange allocation is equivalent to DA 1,000 a person a calendar year (DA 500 for children under 15 years) and is delivered on presentation of a valid passport and travel vouchers; for overland travel, the allocation is DA 1,000 a person a calendar year for adults and DA 500 for children under 15 years. Residents requiring medical treatment abroad receive a foreign exchange allowance equal to DA 800 if the patient is over 15 years and DA 400 if the patient is under 15 years. On each trip to Algeria, Algerians gainfully employed abroad are re- quired to exchange an amount of convertible currency equivalent to DA 700 at the exchange rate operative on the day the transaction takes place. They receive the incentive premium only on those conversions or transfers that are not required of them by law or regulation. Emigrant Algerian workers who take their vacations in Algeria may, when returning abroad, re-export foreign exchange freely imported and duly declared on their arrival in Algeria. Pilgrims traveling to Saudi Arabia receive an alloca- tion in Saudi Arabian riyals; the amount of this allow- ance is fixed for each pilgrimage and may be furnished in the form of checks that may be cashed on arrival for those traveling by sea or by air. Resident travelers may take out Algerian dinar bank notes up to DA 50 a person. Foreign nonresident travelers may also re-export any foreign currency declared upon entry. However, on their arrival in Algeria, foreign nonresidents must convert foreign exchange equivalent to a minimum of DA 1,000. Travel tickets that are bought by nonresidents for traveling abroad must be paid for with imported foreign exchange. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Certain exports, including used equipment and ma- chinery, livestock, firearms, ammunition, explosives, and certain radio equipment, are prohibited regardless of destination. All other exports require a license, except those undertaken by state enterprises having a monopoly right to export. Some commodities may be exported, subject to individual prior approval, on the basis of linked transactions (transactions liees) involving at the same time an authorized import transaction. Since the ALGERIA promulgation of Law No. 78-02 of February 11, 1978, which conferred upon the Government a monopoly over foreign trade, exports may only be effected by public sector entities, unless a waiver is granted for a transi- tional period on a case-by-case basis. Exports must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Sales on consignment are subject to authorization by the Ministry of Finance, and registration must take place prior to customs clearance. Export proceeds must be repatriated immediately after collection. Unless a waiver is granted by the Ministry of Finance or the Central Bank of Algeria, the time limit for repatriation of export proceeds is 120 days from the date of shipment. However, for exports of hydrocarbons, the time limit is a maximum of 30 days after the completion of loading. Those petroleum companies that hold mineral rights must repatriate to Algeria the proceeds from their exports of hydrocarbons, calculated on the basis of a contractual price a barrel that is fixed by agreement with the companies concerned. For one petroleum company holding mineral rights, however, there are different repatriation requirements. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles must be repatriated and surrendered. Savings repatriated in the form of convert- ible currencies by Algerians working abroad are eligible for an encouragement premium. There are no restrictions on the import of foreign bank notes, coin (except gold coin), checks, and letters of credit, but nonresidents, including those of Algerian nationality, must declare such holdings when they enter Algeria. Resident travel- ers may reimport Algerian dinar bank notes up to DA 50 a person. Nonresident travelers are not permitted to bring in Algerian bank notes. Capital Residents are obliged to repatriate and surren- der capital assets (or the sales proceeds thereof) held or acquired outside Algeria. Capital transfers to any destination are subject to individual license; residents are not normally permitted to acquire capital assets outside Algeria. All borrowing abroad or from nonresidents is subject to prior approval by the Minister of Finance or the Central Bank. The Investment Code of September 15, 1966 provides for state guarantees in respect of foreign investments of more than DA 500,000 in the industrial and tourist sectors and for a retransfer guarantee in respect of the sale or liquidation proceeds of invested foreign capital. It also establishes that profit remittances on such invest- ments will be permitted up to 15 percent annually of the foreign capital originally invested. Tax facilities may also be granted, and investments of more than DA 5 mil- lion may be given exclusive rights in a specified geo- graphic area and may toe accorded tariff protection. Remittances of profits and retransfers of capital are permitted only in respect of investments approved under the code. The law on joint ventures with foreign 81 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ALGERIA companies, which came into effect in April 1982, provides foreign partners with a guarantee of fair return on investment, tax exemptions of up to five years on industrial and commercial profits, reduced taxes on reinvestment profits, and the repatriation of earnings and royalties in respect of transfers of technology. Gold Residents may purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in Algeria for numismatic purposes. Under Ordinance No. 70-6 of January 16, 1970, unworked gold for industrial and professional use is distributed by the Agence Nationale pour la Distribution et la Transforma- tion de TOr et des Autres Me*taux Pre*cieux (AGENOR). This agency is also authorized to purchase in Algeria, and to hold, process, and distribute any other precious metal, and, within the exchange control regulations, to import and export any precious metal, including gold, imports of gold ior use by dentists and goldsmiths are made by AGENOR, under import licenses issued by the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank. Changes During 1985 Imports and Import Payments January 1. Under the Budget Law (No. 84-21) of January 24, 1984, with effect from January 1, 1985, the maximum value of equipment goods that could be imported without use of official exchange and free of exchange and trade control formalities was raised from DA 100,000 to DA 200,000. 82 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Antigua and Barbuda is the Eastern Caribbean Dollar,1 which is issued by the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB). The Eastern Caribbean dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at EC$2.70 per US$1. On December 31, 1985 the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar quoted by the ECCB in its transactions with commercial banks were EC$2.6949 and ECS2.7084, respectively, per US$1. The ECCB also quotes daily rates for the Canadian dollar and the pound sterling. All foreign exchange transactions are subject to a levy of 1 percent; the minimum levy is EC$1 a transaction. Antigua and Barbuda formally accepted the obliga- tions of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement as from November 22, 1983. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Ministry of Finance and applies to all currencies. Export licensing is required for a range of products, particularly those subject to export duties. Import licenses are issued by the Collector of Customs in the Ministry of Finance and by the Ministry of Economic Development, depending on the type of commodity. Prescription of Currency Settlements with residents of member countries of the Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM)2 must be made either in the currency of the CARICOM country concerned or in Eastern Caribbean dollars. Settlements with resi- dents of other countries may be made either in any foreign currency or in Eastern Caribbean dollars. Set- tlements involving South African currency are not permitted. Nonresident Accounts External accounts may be opened for nonresidents with the approval of the Ministry of Finance and may be maintained in any currency. With the approval of the Ministry of Finance, such accounts may also be opened by resident individuals or firms in tourist-oriented indus- tries or in export trades where most receipts are in foreign currency and a large portion of inputs are imported or are financed in foreign currency. External accounts can be credited with receipts from sales of merchandise (whether from export-oriented or local production) or from remittances. Commercial banks are *The Eastern Caribbean dollar is also the currency of Anguilla, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, St. Christopher and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. 2The CARICOM countries are Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Chris- topher and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. required to report external accounts operations to the Ministry of Finance on a monthly basis. Imports and Import Payments All imports from South Africa are prohibited. Most goods may be freely imported under open general license granted by the Ministry of Finance. Certain other commodities require individual licenses, unless imported from CARICOM countries. Antigua and Barbuda follows the CARICOM rules of origin adopted in June 1981. Payments for authorized imports are permitted upon application and submission of documentary evidence. Authority is delegated to commercial banks to approve application forms for import licenses after confirming sight of documents. The approved forms must be submitted to the Ministry of Finance on a weekly basis. Imports that are exempt from import duties include basic foods and agricultural imports. All other exemp- tions, for machinery, equipment, and raw materials, are granted on a case-by-case basis and generally under the Fiscal Incentives Law and the Hotel Incentives Act. Import duties are levied at the rate of 35 percent in line with the CARICOM common external tariff. Payments for Invisibles Upon presentation of supporting documents, and with the authorization of the Ministry of Finance, residents may purchase foreign exchange up to the equivalent of US$750 a trip outside the ECCB area; however, this limit may be exceeded with permission from the Minis- try of Finance. In terms of CARICOM traveler's checks (which are denominated in Trinidad and Tobago cur- rency), the basic allowance is TT$500 a trip for holiday travel, TT$2,500 a trip for business, and TT$3,000 a trip for medical expenses. Official authorization is required beyond these limits. There are no limits on the amount of local currency that may be taken out of the country. Profits may be remitted in fu l l, subject to confirmation by the Commission of Inland Revenue of registration for corporate income tax purposes. Student remittances are usually exempted from the foreign exchange levy. Exports and Export Proceeds No export licenses are required for certain com- modities to any destination. No surrender of export proceeds is required, and re-exports are not subject to any tax if they take place within the bonded area. Proceeds from Invisibles Travelers to Antigua and Barbuda may bring in freely notes and coins denominated in Eastern Caribbean dollars or in any foreign currency. Foreign currency coin is not normally exchanged. Checks and drafts in U.S. and Canadian currency can be tendered up to US$1,000 83 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA without restriction; for amounts over US$1,000, Minis- try of Finance approval must be obtained. Levy exemp- tions for transfers, especially for charity purposes, are usually granted. Capital There are no legislated restrictions on capital move- ments. Foreign investment is granted the same incentives as domestic investment under the Fiscal Incentives Law and the Hotel Incentives Act. Large transfers abroad for investment purposes can be phased over time by the Financial Secretary. Gold There are no restrictions on imports of gold. . Changes During 1985 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 84 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ARGENTINA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Argentina is the Austral (plural Australes). The exchange rate for the austral in terms of U.S. dollars is announced on a daily basis by the Central Bank. On December 31, 1985 the closing rate for the austral in terms of the U.S. dollar was A 0.801 = US$1 (selling). Transactions are allowed in certain other currencies,1 with daily quotations based on the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar on markets abroad. Purchases and sales of foreign exchange are subject to a tax of 0.6 percent. Forward exchange operations are permitted in the private sector with maturities of up to 180 days and at rates agreed by buyers and sellers; such operations must be related to trade transactions, financial loans, or other transactions for which direct sale of foreign currency is permitted. Argentina formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement as from May 14, 1968. Administration of Control All exchange transactions must be carried out through entities authorized expressly for this purpose. These authorized entities include banks, exchange agencies, exchange houses, and exchange offices; each of these types of institution may be subject to separate regulation. Prescription of Currency Virtually all payments between Argentina and Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Re- public, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela are made through accounts maintained by the Central Bank of Argentina and the central banks con- cerned, under reciprocal credit agreements within the framework of the multilateral clearing system of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA). Argen- tina maintains reciprocal credit arrangements with Cuba, Poland, and the U .S .S .R. by means of special accounts in each central bank through which transactions are settled. Transactions with other countries must be settled in freely usable currencies. Nonresident Accounts Authorized banks may open accounts in australes and in foreign exchange in the name of any nonresident, provided that the accounts are credited with remittances of convertible currencies only. Balances on nonresident accounts may be used freely for any purpose, in Argentina or abroad. Transfers between accounts may be effected freely, except in payment for exports.

Imports and Import Payments Import payments may be effected in convertible currencies, except as otherwise specified in the regula- tions on prescription of currency. Settlement of pay- ments for imports by the private sector may be freely effected by authorized financial entities, provided that the financing conforms to terms established by the Central Bank and that payment is effected not earlier than one or two days prior to the due date; otherwise, if payment is not effected on the due date, it must be postponed for a minimum period as defined in the prevailing regulation for such an operation. Imports and related payments by the public sector require the prior approval of the Central Bank. In addition to customs duties, imports are subject to a stamp duty of 0.6 percent and selective internal taxes ranging from 5 percent to 22 percent. Most public and private sector imports require an import license (Certificate of Sworn Declaration of Need to Import) issued by the National Import Directorate of the Commerce Secretariat. An exception is made for imports of up to US$500 per month in any single customs classification by any single importer (subject to an annual limit of US$6,000 per importer for each category of goods), which can be processed directly by the intervening bank without the prior issuance of an import license by the Commerce Secretariat. Certain public enterprises are also permitted to import under foreign treaties without the issuance of an import license. Import licenses are issued only after the importer has placed with a bank a deposit equal to either the estimated duty payable on the import, or 5 percent of the import value, in cases of lower or equivalent value. The deposits are blocked until the import duty is paid or for a period of 90 days, whichever is earlier; they are indexed in terms of the U .S. dollar. The following set of procedures apply to the acquisi- tion of an import license for all imports that require licensing. While the import of goods classified as "nonessential" (List I) is technically prohibited, all goods on List I have been transferred to List II (see below) on a temporary basis. The goods temporarily on List II include consumer goods and industrial inputs for which close substitutes are amply available in Argentina. The prohibition on the importation of goods on List I, when it applies, does not apply to temporary imports, goods included in the border traffic scheme, or samples and prototypes. The Secretary of Commerce is em- powered to grant import licenses for goods on List I when the item is considered necessary for scientific or technical reasons, or in light of the quantity or quality of domestic production. Most capital goods, certain industrial inputs, and goods temporarily transferred from the list of prohibited goods are included in List II. For goods on this list, the 85 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ARGENTINA Commerce Secretariat issues import licenses upon ap- proval by the Industry Secretariat and by an Honorary Import Advisory Committee on which both government institutions and competent commercial and industrial organizations are represented. When the Industry Secre- tariat does not approve an import license request, the Commerce Secretariat is empowered to study the indi- vidual case and make a determination. Import licenses for certain raw materials and inputs for the pharmaceut- ical industry and for medical and health services (List III) require the prior approval of the Ministry of Health and Social Action, and licenses for imports intended for national defense and for the security and police forces require the prior approval of the Ministries of Defense or Interior. Import licenses are granted automatically for all goods not specifically covered by the foregoing provisions. Goods imported under concessions granted by any instrument of the LAIA agreement are exempt from the prohibition applicable to goods on List I and the review requirement for goods on List II. Import licenses are issued automatically for goods covered under the Argen- tine-Uruguayan Economic Cooperation Agreement. Once granted, an import license retains its validity for 120 days. The actual import value (f.o.b.) must be no more than 10 percent above the stated value of the sworn declaration submitted in application for an import license. Countertrade is permitted for firms engaging in the exportation of promoted exports. In such cases import payment can take the form of the exportation of promoted goods. Most imports are subject to minimum financing terms of at least 180 days, calculated from the date of shipment. However, imports of goods on the negotiated lists from the LAIA have a minimum financing term of 90 days. Most other imports from Latin America, including those from the Central American Common Market (CACM), Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Panama, are subject to minimum financing terms of 120 days from shipment. Payment against shipping documents is permitted in the following cases: goods imported from Brazil ("negotiated goods"); Chile ("ne- gotiated goods"); Ecuador ("negotiated goods"); Mexico (goods under trade compensation programs); Paraguay (certain specified goods); Peru (goods negotiated under LAIA Agreement No. 6); Uruguay (goods negotiated under the Partial Scope Agreement on Economic Com- plementation No. 1); and goods imported by Antarctica and the Islands of the South Atlantic and destined for the Special Customs Area established by Law No. 19640;2 also fresh fruit received on consignment basis; and periodicals. 2Imports destined for the Special Customs Area of Tierra del Fuego are subject to the following m in imum financing terms: 75 days for imports on the "Negotiated List" shipped from and originating in LAIA countries; 105 days for "non-negotiated" imports from the LAIA and imports from the CACM, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, or Panama; and 150 days for imports from all other countries. 86 Special minimum financing terms apply for imports of capital goods valued at more than US$50,000. Not more than 5 percent of the f .o .b. value may be settled prior to shipment and an additional 10 percent may be paid upon the submission of shipping documents. The balance of 85 percent is to be paid in equal installments beginning not earlier than six months after shipment, according to the following schedule: Value of Import f.o.b. (In thousands of U.S. dollars) 50- 250 250- 500 500-1,000 1,000-1,500 1,500-2,000 More than 2,000 Minimum Financing Term 1 year 2 years 3 years 4 years 5 years To be determined upon consultation with the Central Bank Imports of capital goods for which financing amounting to 85 percent of the f .o .b. value is provided by international organizations or official creditors are exempt from these minimum terms, as are imports by firms located in the National Territories of Tierra del Fuego, Antarctica, and the Islands of the South Atlantic. Payments for Invisibles Certain payments for invisibles require prior approval by the Central Bank. In general, the sale of foreign exchange at the official rate is not permitted for travel abroad; however, in exceptional cases, the Central Bank may approve the sale of foreign exchange for travel abroad for medical treatment or for participation in trade fairs. Authorized entities may carry out the following transactions without consulting the Central Bank: (a) sale of foreign exchange for payment of banking fees, commissions, and interest in connection with import operations authorized individually or by general provi- sions; (b) at the request of Argentine exporters, sale of foreign exchange for the purchase of specifications for international competitive bidding; (c) freight charges for Argentine export and import operations; (d) remittances of funds received in australes by foreign shipping companies in Argentina, in connection with the above- mentioned freight operations, after deducting local costs, which, when appropriate, must be covered with funds received from abroad and negotiated in the foreign exchange market; (e) settlement of expenditures incurred abroad by Argentine shipping companies, excluding costs relating to passenger services; (f) insurance of merchandise imports and exports, capital goods for the amount unpaid abroad, insurance of hulls of ships and airplanes, or supplementary insurance of Argentine shipping companies, reinsurance and losses related to these operations; (g) consular receipts, lease of ships by Argentine shipping companies for international shipment of merchandise, scholarships and educational expenses, ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution family assistance, retirement and pensions, and purchase of medicine by private citizens. Exports and Export Proceeds Minimum export prices (reference prices) are estab- lished for many agricultural and livestock exports as a basis for the payment of duties and the surrender of export proceeds. The full f .o .b. proceeds from all exports must be repatriated and surrendered; the pro- ceeds must not be less than the reference price, or if there is no reference price, the f.o.b. value declared on the shipping permit. Proceeds may be received in any convertible currency. Proceeds from traditional exports must be received before shipment, by means of advance payments or irrevocable letters of credit payable against shipping documents in Argentina. Proceeds from pro- moted exports must be repatriated within 180 days from the date of shipment. In both cases, export proceeds must be surrendered within 15 working days from the respective time limits. Traditional exports are subject to export taxes. The applicable tax rates on December 31, 1985 were 15 per- cent for wheat, 29 percent for corn, 28 percent for sorghum, 32.5 percent for soybeans, 15-24 percent for edible oils, 6-15 percent for beef, and 20 percent for processed hides. Certain nontraditional exports are eligible for rebates, and most others are subject to a small export tax. On December 31, 1985 rebates on certain steel products amounted to 10 percent of export value and the export taxes ranged from zero to 32.5 percent of export value, depending on the type of product. Exports shipped through certain ports were eligible for additional rebates ranging from 7 to 12 percent. Many exports, particularly nontraditional exports, are eligible for other export incentives of various kinds. The Central Bank has established a number of special financing regimes to be granted to Argentine exporters through banks, with a view to promoting exports of certain goods and services. Also, the Argentine Export Credit Insurance Company provides credit insurance against commercial and ordinary risks and also coverage for extraordinary risks (on the account of the Central Government) for exports of capital goods and other specified consumer goods. Certain products, mostly nontraditional exports, may be shipped "on consign- ment" for 360 days; if not sold within that period, the goods must be returned to Argentina. Various export incentives are provided for promoted exports in accordance with the Export Promotion Laws of December 16, 1984. These include: (i) a deduction against taxable profits, up to 10 percent of the value of certain exports; (ii) the creation of export consortia and cooperatives and the granting of an incentive equal to 4 percent of the f.o.b. value of exports over a period of five years; (iii) the establishment of international trading companies; (iv) permission for firms to engage in countertrade when marketing promoted exports; (v) a ARGENTINA tax-drawback scheme under which rebates would be allowed for taxes of imported inputs and other taxes; (vi) the elimination of the 0.5 percent stamp tax for exports from the Federal Capital Area; and (vii) the funding of an Export Promotion Fund to finance partici- pation in trade fairs and exhibitions. For traditional exports, the maximum terms for anti- cipated payments and foreign currency export prefinance are 120 days for processed goods, such as edible oils and processed meats, and 90 days for grains and other unprocessed agricultural products. For nontraditional exports, the maximum term for anticipated payments and foreign currency export prefinance is 180 days. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign currency receipts obtained in the country or abroad by Argentine shipping companies, airlines, or surface transportation companies from freight and fares and foreign currency receipts from insurance, reinsur- ance or losses, lease of ships, airplanes or other surface means, and space or storage in Argentine ports must be surrendered within 30 days of receipt. Exchange derived from other invisibles need not be surrendered. Travelers may bring in freely any amount in domestic or foreign bank notes and coin, as well as gold coin and "good delivery" gold bars. Capital Proceeds from financial loans must be sold in the foreign exchange market as an eligibility condition for subsequent sales of foreign exchange to amortize such loans. Financial credits must have maturities of at least 360 days and in all cases must have fixed maturity dates. Principal and interest payments for loans received after November 28, 1984 may be effected directly through authorized entities on the maturity date without prior Central Bank authorization. All amortization payments for loans received prior to November 28, 1984 and not related to import operations carried out in accordance with the minimum conditions specified for such pay- ments may be settled through the subscription of U.S. dollar bonds of the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic, payable in 15 semiannual installments, with a grace period of three years. All loans outstanding and covered by a swap agree- ment with the Central Bank as of December 4, 1982 and all loans for which the domestic borrower has obtained an exchange rate guarantee from the Central Bank and which fell due through the end of 1985 have been extended under minimum terms established by the Central Bank. Loans covered by swap agreements that fell due in 1985 were either to be rescheduled by means of the issuance of U .S. dollar-denominated obligations of the Central Bank (BCRA Notes) with a ten-year maturity, or by a direct refinancing between debtor and creditor for up to five years followed by the issuance of a BCRA Note for the remainder of a ten-year period. No guidelines have been issued for the treatment of swaps falling due in 1986 and beyond. Loans covered by 87 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ARGENTINA exchange rate guarantees that fell due in 1985 were rescheduled by means of the issuance of U .S. dollar- denominated obligations of the Government of Argen- tina (Notes) with a ten-year maturity. Pursuant to the rescheduling of obligations due to commercial banks, which was signed in August 1985, private sector obligations due to commercial banks have been refinanced. These include (i) principal obligations that fell due during the period April 1982 through 1985 that were not covered by exchange rate guarantees granted by the Republic of Argentina, and (ii) principal obligations that fell due during 1984 and 1985 that were covered by exchange rate guarantees granted by the Republic of Argentina. The former were rescheduled by means of the issuance of U.S. dollar-denominated obligations of the BCRA (or BCRA Notes) with a ten- year maturity; the latter were rescheduled by means of the issuance of Notes as described above. There were also provisions for the regularization of unpaid interest over the period until the end of September 1985. The inflow of financial loans undertaken by local foreign-owned enterprises and originating from foreign enterprises that either directly or indirectly control the borrowing enterprises or are their subsidiaries requires the prior approval of the Central Bank. Loans endorsed or guaranteed by the State also require prior authoriza- tion from the Central Bank. Banks may accept foreign currency sight or term deposits; in the latter case, deposits must be for the account and to the order of the Central Bank, with maturities of 60-360 days. Foreign borrowing by the public sector is regulated by Decree- Law No. 19328 of October 29, 1971 and Decree No. 3532 of November 25, 1975. Outward capital transfers are subject to prior authorization by the Central Bank. The foreign investment regime is governed by the Foreign Investment Law (codified text of 1980), which incorporates the amendments made under Law No. 22208 to Law No. 21382. Promulgated by Decree No. 1062 of June 30, 1980, the Foreign Investment Law is regulated by Decree No. 103 of January 19, 1981. Investments may be made in freely convertible foreign currency in the form of new or used capital goods and their spare parts and accessories; profits and capital in Argentine currency belonging to foreign investors (provided that they are legally transfer- able abroad); capitalization of external credits received in freely convertible foreign currency; intangible assets; and any other form acceptable to the implementing authority or covered by a special regime or a promotion regime. For approval purposes, investments are classified into three categories, as follows: (1) Subject to prior approval by the National Execu- tive are (a) investments in the defense and national security sectors, in public service sectors including the postal system, electricity, gas, telecommunications, computers, electronic equipment, and in radio transmit- ters, television stations, newspapers, periodicals and 88 magazines, energy, education, and financial and insur- ance institutions; (b) transfers of capital and the acquisi- tion of shares (the latter being permissible only in exceptional cases when it is manifestly beneficial to the national economy) that involve changing the national ownership structure of a local firm belonging to national investors and having net assets exceeding US$10 mil- lion; (c) new transfers of freely convertible foreign currency not exceeding US$5 million and not involving a change in the national ownership structure of an existing local firm; (d) investment in any of Argentina's stock markets, provided that the amount does not exceed US$2 million for each foreign investor and so long as total foreign investment does not exceed 2 percent of the capital of the company involved; (e) investments where the investor is a juridical person under public law; and (f) investments where special or promotional benefits are requested that can only be granted by the National Executive and the proposed investment is contingent on them. (2) No prior approval is required for (a) total or partial reinvestment of a registered foreign investor's profits (even in the sectors referred to in item (1) above), provided that they do not involve changing the national ownership structure of the receiving firm and are intended to foster the activities for which the original investment was approved or in which the firm was engaged when the law entered into force; (b) new investments in freely convertible foreign currency made for the same purposes as mentioned in item (1) above, and not exceeding 30 percent of the registered capital in the receiving firm and which do not involve converting it into a "domestic firm with foreign capital," or new investments that are made pursuant to a preferential right and in order to maintain an interest equal to or lower than what was held up to that time; (c) new transfers of freely convertible foreign currency not exceeding US$5 million and not involving a change in the national ownership structure of an existing local firm; and (d) investment in any of Argentina's stock markets, provided that the amount does not exceed US$2 million for each foreign investor and so long as total foreign investment does not exceed 2 percent of the capital of the company involved. (3) All other foreign investments are subject to prior approval by the implementing authority, which must give its decision within 120 days from the date on which the investment proposal is submitted. Foreign investments existing prior to the entry into force of the Foreign Investment Law are governed by its provisions, which include a special regime for their inscription and recognition. Existing and new foreign investments, as well as all capital movements relating thereto, may be recorded in the Register of Foreign Investments, which is kept by the Ministry of Economy. Since September 1984, the Central Bank has enter- tained applications for the capitalization into foreign direct investment of principal falling due with an exchange rate guarantee. From February to September 1985, many such applications were approved, but since ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution then approval has not been forthcoming. In addition, although no Central Bank circular has provided formal authorization, certain requests for the capitalization into foreign direct investment of swaps falling due were approved in 1985. Registered foreign investments may generally be repatriated three years after entry into Argentina, unless a longer period was fixed when the investment was approved. The right to transfer profits and to repatriate capital related to properly registered investments can be suspended only by the National Executive. In that event, registered foreign investors are entitled to receive, for the remittance of profits abroad, the equivalent of the sum to be tranferred in external public debt securities denominated in foreign currency at the rate of interest prevailing in the international market, against provision of the equivalent in Argentine currency; this regulation is applied under Decree No. 1506/84, which also prohibits the repatriation of capital. Profits on registered foreign capital are subject to a special tax on after-tax profit when they exceed 12 per- cent of registered capital on an annual basis. This tax is 15 percent on profits of more than 12 percent and up to 15 percent of registered capital, 20 percent for those of more than 15 percent and up to 20 percent of registered capital, and 25 percent for those of more than 20 percent of registered capital. The extension of domestic credit to "domestic firms with foreign capital" is subject to special provisions, as set forth in Law No. 21382 (Article 17) and Decree No. 283/77 (Article 71, as amended in 1980). Gold Residents may hold gold coin and gold in any other form in Argentina or abroad. Financial institutions, exchange houses, and exchange agencies may buy or sell gold in the form of coin or "good delivery" bars among themselves or buy such gold from their clients. Gold exports must be paid for in convertible currencies. Imports of gold by industrial users are subject to a statistical duty of 0.6 percent, and those by other users are subject in addition to a sales tax. Institutions may carry out arbitrage operations on coined gold or "good delivery" gold with their clients, against foreign bank notes. Changes During 1985 Imports and Import Payments January 2.

The scheme covered those interest payments without exchange guar- antee that arose from both principal obligations covered and not covered by exchange guarantee. For principal payments covered by exchange rate guarantee, the scheme pertained to interest accrued up to the maturity date of the principal. For principal payments not covered by exchange guarantee, the scheme pertained to interest accrued both before and after the maturity date of the principal. For interest payments that were covered, private sector entities were permitted to purchase foreign currency equivalent to 10 percent of the interest obliga- tion and transfer this amount directly to the creditor to liquidate the obligation. For the remaining 90 percent of interest, private sector entities were to pay the local currency counterpart of the obligation and to desig- nate a local commercial bank to submit a U.S. dollar- denominated 120-day certificate of deposit for an equiva- lent amount made out to the foreign creditor. A schedule was established under which interest payments on principal falling due in the periods October 3, 1983 to 90 December 31, 1983, in the first half of 1984, in the second half of 1984, and in the first five months of 1985 could be liquidated according to the above described terms during the periods up through February 28, 1985, March 1985, April 1985, and May 1985, respectively (Communication A 576).

April 8. The Central Bank issued a list of debt service obligations being refinanced under the Paris Club accord and announced that, as a consequence, these obligations would not be paid upon maturity (Communication A 621).

The interest accrued on principal obliga- tions that matured in 1985 would be paid in foreign exchange when the corresponding Note was issued. The regulations provided that for obligations falling due through July 1, 1985, applications for the issuance of Notes and the liquidation of accrued interest should be submitted by August 30, 1985 and that for later obligations, applications would be submitted within 30 days of the maturity date. Obligations covered by the commercial bank refinancing of public debt and by the Paris Club accord were excluded from these regulations (Communication A 697). July 8.

Interest on bonds without exchange guaran- tee, for amounts falling due by December 31, 1985, were exempted, as such obligations were regulated by Communication A 696. The period of sale of foreign exchange for payments falling due up to the regulation date was extended to July 26, 1985; and for those subsequently falling due, payment should be made not later than 30 days from the maturity date. July 26. The Central Bank announced that obligations for which settlement was subject to Central Bank approval on Form 4008-G and 3687, requiring deposits in accordance with Communication A 703, maturing and payable as of July 15, 1985, and for which requests were not submitted by July 30, 1985, inclusive, should be considered refinanced for a minimum period of one year from July 15, 1985 (Communication A 729).

The annual incentive could not exceed 80 percent of operating expenses, and firms would have to meet certain export growth targets to retain eligibility. In addition, export finance was made available for up to 70 percent of various costs incurred by small- and medium-sized firms entering into consor- tia. Third, the establishment of international trading companies as a means to facilitate better penetration of foreign markets was permitted. These firms were obliged to engage in a minimum of trade in promoted exports and to maintain a positive trade position. Provision was made for Central Bank financing for the opening of foreign offices. Fourth, firms were permitted to engage in countertrade when marketing promoted exports. Fifth, exporters of finished goods were permitted a tax "draw- back," whereby exporters could apply for rebates of duties on imported inputs and other taxes. Sixth, exporters of promoted goods were exempted from the stamp duty. Seventh, a 0.5 percent tax on imports of consumption goods was imposed with revenues to be channeled into the Export Promotion Fund; the resources of the Fund would be used to support the participation of Argentine exporters in trade fairs and expositions, for commercial missions abroad, and for trade promotion publicity (Presidential Decrees Nos. 173-179).

Regulations were also issued governing the formation of trading companies as provided for by Decree No. 175 (see entry for January 25, 1985), and minimum require- ments on net worth and annual exports were established for such enterprises (Resolution ME 680). August 20. The export of cotton was temporarily suspended (Resolution JNG 3635). August 26. The credit line of US$120 million granted by the Central Bank for financing exports from Argen- tina to Uruguay was extended through June 4, 1986, and the interest rate on the applicable credit line was lowered from 7.5 percent to 6.5 percent (Communica- tion B 1812). August 27. The temporary suspension of cotton exports, imposed on August 20, 1985, was lifted for certain grades of cotton (Resolution JNG 3644). August 29. The exceptions from the special rebate for exports of certain steel products to the United States and the European Economic Community were eliminated. (The special rebate had been set at 10 percent and the rebate for excepted cases had been 4 percent—see entry for April 22, 1985. The changes in rebates associated with compensation for exchange rate depreciation had reduced the former to zero and converted the latter to a 6 percent export tax—see entry for June 11, 1985. The elimination of the exception reduced this tax to zero (Resolution ME 785).) 93 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ARGENTINA September 12. The export of unfinished or semi- finished leather was suspended (Resolution SCI 321). September 16.

September 27. Export taxes on tea products were low- ered by 10-15 percent, depending on the grade of tea, resulting in new tax rates ranging from 0 —15.5 percent (Resolution ME 952). September 30. Export taxes for wool products were reduced, resulting in new rates ranging from 14 percent to 28 percent. The rate applicable to unwashed wool was lowered from 32 percent to 28 percent and that applica- ble to washed wool was lowered from 26.5 percent to 20.5 percent (Resolution ME 966). October 4. The tax on exports of wheat was lowered from 26.5 percent to 15 percent (Resolution ME 998). October 11.

In addition, the credit line granted by the Central Bank for financing exports from Argentina to Honduras, which had expired on April 12, 1985, was renewed through April 12, 1987 (Communication B 1833). October 14. The credit line granted by the Central Bank for financing exports from Argentina to Bolivia was raised to US$150 million and extended through March 18, 1986, and the interest rate on the credit line was lowered from 7.5 percent to 6.5 percent (Communi- cation B 1836). October 17. The tax on exports of linseed was reduced from 31 percent to 21 percent (Resolution ME 1017), and a temporary export rebate of 10 percent was introduced for a large number of steel products through December 31, 1985, but an exception was made for exports of these products destined for the United States and the European Economic Community, in which case the rebate was set at 4 percent (Resolution ME 1021). November 1. The taxes on the export of linseed oil and other linseed products were reduced by 3-4 percent, depending on the product, resulting in new taxes ranging from 13.5 percent to 27 percent (Resolution ME 1128). November 8. The Central Bank announced a decrease from 7.5 percent to 6.5 percent in the interest rate charged on drawings on lines of credit to promote Argentine exports (Communication B 1864). November 11. The Government of Argentina an- nounced the opening of a credit line of US$10 million to finance certain Argentine exports to Benin over a period of two years (Communication B 1865). In addition, the Government announced the opening of a credit line of US$10 million to finance specified Argentine exports to the Central African Republic over a period of two years (Communication B 1866). 94 December 30. Regulations were issued by the Central Bank concerning countertrade operations pursuant to Decree No. 176 (see January 25, above), and a max- imum period of 180 days was established for the completion of the two sides of countertrade operations (Communication A 825). Capital April 1. The Central Bank extended until May 31 the deadline for the expiration of the scheme for the capital- ization of loans with exchange guarantee into foreign dir- ect investment. (The Central Bank had explained in Sep- tember 1984 that it was willing to consider such requests (Communication A 532), and it began to approve requests in early 1985 (Communication C 2016).) April 4. The Central Bank issued a list of debt ser- vice obligations being refinanced under the Paris Club accord and announcedthat, as a consequence, these obligations would not be paid upon maturity (Commu- nication A 621). May 6. A financial support system was established for banks and savings institutions to help them in servicing deposits in foreign currency. In addition, the Central Bank fixed a reserve requirement of 100 percent on the growth of foreign currency-denominated deposits in the commercial banking system after April 30, 1985. De- posits existing before that date were to have been deposited at the Central Bank or lent for the purpose of export finance (Communication A 643). May 17. The Central Bank, citing prudential con- cerns, suspended for 120 days deposits into and with- drawals from foreign currency-denominated accounts, with the exception of deposits of foreign delegations and international organizations. In addition, the Central Bank established that depositors could request BONEX bonds (at 93 percent of par) for term deposits as they matured (Communication A 652). May 27. The Central Bank again extended until August 31 the expiration of the scheme for the capitaliza- tion of loans with exchange guarantee into foreign direct investment (see entry for April 1, 1985) (Communica- tion C 2112). May 31. The Central Bank issued regulations govern- ing the suspension of deposits into, or withdrawals from, foreign currency deposits (see entry for May 17, 1985), including a schedule for the extension of the maturity of deposits falling due during the period of the suspension (Communication A 663). June 28. The Central Bank raised from 180 days to one year the minimum maturity on inflows of foreign financial capital negotiated in the official exchange market (Communication A 688). In addition, for exports of grains and principal agricultural products, the maxi- mum permissible terms for payment and for foreign currency export prefinance were shortened from 180 days to 30 days, while for most other exports, the maximum term was set at 360 days (Communica- tion A 690). ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution July 1. The Central Bank issued regulations governing the refinancing of foreign currency principal obligations of the private sector not covered by exchange guarantee that had matured or would mature through December 31, 1985 and the liquidation of accrued interest on these obligations. Principal obligations due through this date would be refinanced, following the deposit by the Argentine debtor of the local currency amount required to cancel the obligation, by means of the issuance of obligations of the Central Bank (BCRA Notes) denomi- nated in U.S. dollars. BCRA Notes would be repaid in 15 semiannual installments beginning three years after the date of issuance. Each foreign creditor would be permitted to elect the use of LIBOR or a certificate of deposit rate for interest charges, with the LIBOR option carrying a spread of !3/s percentage points. The interest accrued through October 31, 1985 on obligations to be refinanced by BCRA Notes would be liquidated by the transfer of foreign exchange equal to 10 percent of the accrued interest and by the submission of a 120-day certificate of deposit made out to the foreign creditor for the remaining 90 percent of the accrued interest. When the certificate of deposit matured, foreign exchange equal to its value would be transferred. The certificates of deposit would carry an interest charge equal to the three-month LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1 percent on an annual basis. The regulation provided that for obliga- tions falling due through July 1, 1985, applications for the issuance of BCRA Notes and the liquidation of accrued interest would be submitted by August 30, 1985 and that for later obligations, applications would be submitted within 30 days of the maturity date. Obligations covered by the commercial bank refinancing of public sector debt and by the Paris Club accord were excluded from these regulations (Communica- tion A 696). At the same time, the Central Bank issued regulations governing the refinancing of foreign currency principal obligations covered by exchange guarantee which matured in 1984 and 1985 or would mature in 1985 and the liquidation of accrued interest on these obligations. Principal obligations due in this period would be refi- nanced, following the deposit by the Argentine debtor of the local currency amount required to cancel the obliga- tion, by means of the issuance of obligations of the Government of Argentina (Notes) denominated in U.S. dollars. The Notes would be repaid in 15 semi- annual installments beginning three years after the date of issuance. Each foreign creditor would be permitted to elect the use of LIBOR or the prime rate for interest charges, with the LIBOR option carrying a spread of P/8 percentage points. The interest accrued on principal obligations that matured through December 31, 1984 and that were to be refinanced by Notes would be liquidated by the transfer of foreign exchange equal to 10 percent of the accrued interest and by the submission of a 120-day certificate of deposit made out to the foreign creditor for the remaining 90 percent of accrued interest. When the ARGENTINA certificate of deposit matured, foreign exchange equal to its value would be transferred. The certificates of deposit would carry an interest charge equal to the three-month LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1 percent on an annual basis. The interest accrued on principal obligations that matured in 1985 would be paid in foreign exchange when the corresponding Note was issued. The regula- tions provided that for obligations falling due through July 1, 1985, applications for the issuance of Notes and the liquidation of accrued interest should be submitted by August 30, 1985 and that for later obligations, applica- tions would be submitted within 30 days of the maturity date. Obligations covered by the commercial bank refinancing of public debt and by the Paris Club accord were excluded from these regulations (Communica- tion A 697). In addition, the Central Bank issued regulations governing the refinancing of swap operations falling due in 1985, including amounts due in 1985 as a result of rollovers mandated by the Central Bank in earlier years. The regulations called for a 180-day extension of maturities falling due in the period Febru- ary 22, 1985 to July 3, 1985, and established two options for the refinancing of obligations falling due as of July 4, 1985: a refinancing via bonds of the Central Bank (BCRA Notes) denominated in U.S. dollars, and a direct refinancing between creditors and debtors. Under both options, debtors were first obliged to carry out proce- dures for the liquidation of exchange guarantees, which involved constituting a frozen deposit equal to part of the value of the exchange rate guarantee. Under the first option, BCRA Notes would be issued to the creditor refinancing the obligation for ten years, while under the second option, creditors and debtors would agree to refinance the swap for a period of five years, at which time a BCRA Note with a five-year maturity would be issued. The interest charges and amortization schedules for the direct refinancing and for the five-year BCRA Notes were established so as to match those of the first option (Communication A 695). July 5. The Central Bank updated the list of obliga- tions to be refinanced under the Paris Club (Commu- nication A 621), and announced that these obligations could not be settled on their due dates (Communica- tion A 700). July 8. The Central Bank instituted a deposit scheme under which persons with debt service obligations not covered by exchange guarantee that matured before July 1, 1985 were instructed to constitute a deposit in local currency at the Central Bank before July 27, 1985 equivalent to the debt service obligation. These deposits and the corresponding debt service obligations would be discharged according to the norms established under Communication A 696 (see entry for July 1, 1985) (Communication A 704). July 19. The Central Bank partially lifted the suspen- sion of the withdrawal of funds from accounts in foreign currencies; beginning from August 1, 1985, depositors were permitted to withdraw up to the equivalent of 95 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ARGENTINA US$1,500 from each account or certificate of deposit upon or after its maturity (Communication A 724). In addition, for exports of grains and principal agricultural products, the maximum terms for prepayments and foreign currency export prefinance (which had been shortened to 30 days on June 28, 1985) were lengthened. For processed agricultural goods, such as oils and meal, the maximum term was set at 120 days and for other goods the maximum term was set at 90 days (Communi- cation A 722). July 25. In a revision of regulations governing foreign currency deposits in the banking system, the Central Bank required banks to maintain a 100 percent reserve deposit on foreign currency demand deposits. Foreign currency time deposits were to be accepted for the account and to the order of the Central Bank for a specified period of 60-360 days. The Central Bank would provide rediscounts to commercial banks for up to 40 percent of their fixed-term foreign currency deposits to be used by banks for foreign trade finance (Communi- cation A 725). July 29. The Central Bank announced a schedule for the constitution of local currency deposits against debt service obligations that had been called for in Communi- cation A 704 (see entry for July 8, 1985). For obligations falling due through July 1 and July 31, deposits were to be constituted by July 31 and August 5, respectively; for those falling due between August 1 and October 31, deposits were to be constituted within five days of maturity, but no later than October 31. In the event that the required deposits were not made by the indicated dates, the obligations would be considered refinanced for an additional 90 days with respect to the preceding schedule (Communication A 731). August 22. It was announced that, prior to the presentation of requests (Form 4008H) for payments abroad in the form of interest and for which the creditor was a foreign commercial bank, the institutions involved and the debtors should check to find out whether the payments were related to transactions to be refinanced through the Paris Club and should refrain from pre- senting payment requests for transactions included in the lists of Circular SEPEX-1-4 (Communication A 700 of July 5, 1985). Payment requests bearing only one or neither of these characteristics should be subjected to such checking after authorization but prior to payment. Request forms submitted after August 30, 1985 would be considered, subject to the above-mentioned checking. The checks should be updated in the case of additions to the list of transactions attached to Communication A 700 of July 7, 1985. August 29. It was decided that foreign direct invest- ment in the importation, production, and marketing of computers, telecommunications, and electronic equip- ment would be subject to prior approval of the Secre- 96 tariat of Industry and the Secretariat of Science and Technology (Presidential Decree No. 1622). September 3. The Central Bank announced regulations governing the lifting of the 120-day suspension of withdrawal of funds from accounts in foreign currency (see entry for July 19, 1985). Depositors were permitted, beginning from September 10, 1985, to withdraw up to the equivalent of US$8,500 of principal and accrued interest on such principal from each account or certificate of deposit upon its maturity. For any amount that matured up through the end of the 120-day suspension on September 16, 1985, but was in excess of the withdrawal provisions, withdrawal would be permitted in Octo- ber 1985 on the same day of the month of the original maturity. Amounts maturing after September 16, 1985 would be available upon their maturity dates (Communi- cation A 764). October 23. The Central Bank issued regulations governing the refinancing of debt owed by public enter- prises and official banks and used by private sector entities with government guarantee or by means of official banks' utilization of external lines of credit. These regulations clarified the procedures that had been set out in Communications A 696 and A 697 (see entry for July 1, 1985). In the case of such debts with ex- change guarantee, refinancing would be by means of the issuance of promissory notes of the Government of Argentina denominated in U .S. dollars. For obligations that fell due in 1982 and 1983, the notes would be repaid in 15 backloaded semiannual installments beginning on March 1, 1988; for obligations falling due in 1984 and 1985, the notes would be repaid in 19 backloaded semiannual installments beginning on March 1, 1988. For loans that carried LIB OR interest rates, a spread of 2Vs percent could be paid for the period through the end of 1984, and a spread of !3/s percent would be paid thereafter; for loans at the prime interest rate, a spread of 2 percent would be paid for the period through the end of 1984, and a spread of 1 percent would be paid thereafter. In the case of debts without exchange guarantee, the refinancing would be part of the general refinancing of public sector debt (Communication A 790). November 5. The Central Bank announced provisions for the settlement of private sector obligations, included in the refinancing through the Paris Club, of debts owed to France (Communication A 798). November 11. In a clarification of the regulations issued by the Central Bank concerning the refinancing of swap obligations (as described in Communica- tion A 695), the maximum period for direct rescheduling between creditor and debtor was set at five years, but allowance was made for shorter periods. In cases of shorter direct refinancings, the maturity of the BCRA notes would be adjusted so as to maintain a total refinancing period o f t en years (Communication A 799). ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution AUSTRALIA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Australia is the Australian Dollar.l The Australian authorities do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions; exchange rates are determined on the basis of demand and supply conditions in the exchange market, but the Reserve Bank of Australia retains discretionary power to intervene in the foreign exchange market. On December 31, 1985 the closing buying and selling rates in terms of the U .S. dol- lar were $A 1.468 = US$1 and $A 1.469 = US$1, respectively. There are no taxes or subsidies on pur- chases or sales of foreign exchange. Trading banks and authorized nonbank financial in- stitutions are allowed to engage in foreign exchange transactions and may deal among themselves and with their customers at mutually negotiated rates. Deal- ers may hold foreign currency balances (spot and for- ward) or incur foreign currency liabilities (spot and forward) within limits established by the Reserve Bank for each dealer. In addition, there is a foreign currency hedge market in which dealers match the currency hedge requirements of their customers at market-determined rates. Nonresidents may transact business in this market, although it is a nondelivery market with all settlements effected in Australian dollars. As part of Australia's current foreign exchange ar- rangements, a range of outward foreign exchange trans- actions are subject to procedural requirements in order to meet the Government's taxation screening policies. A taxation clearance certificate issued by the Australian Taxation Office must be sighted by authorized foreign exchange dealers before foreign exchange or other means of payment is made available for certain transac- tions with residents of designated countries and areas2 and for emigrants' remittances in excess of $A 50,000 or its foreign currency equivalent to all countries. In respect of countries that are not designated for taxation screening purposes, foreign exchange dealers are obliged to require that their customers complete declaration forms for outflows of more than $A 50,000 or its foreign currency equivalent and which relate to investments, gifts, suste- nance and trust distributions, loans or loan repayments, travel expenditure, remittances connected with futures operations overseas and payments of interest, dividends, service fees, or royalties. Australia formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2 , 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from July 1, 1965. 1The Australian dollar also circulates in a number of other countries, including Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu. 2These are listed as The Bahamas, Bermuda, British Channel Islands, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, Grenada, Hong Kong, Isle of Man, Liberia, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Nauru, Netherlands Antilles, Panama, Switzerland, Tonga, and Vanuatu. Administration of Control The Reserve Bank is responsible for administering the remaining exchange control restrictions under Aus- tralia's current foreign exchange arrangements. (Most exchange controls were abolished on December 12, 1983.) Import and export controls are imposed on certain commodities pursuant to the Customs Act. These con- trols are administered by the relevant ministers and departments according to regulations under that Act. Prescription of Currency Both outward and inward payments may be settled in Australian currency or in any foreign currency,3 but purchases and sales of foreign currency by residents in exchange for Australian currency must be undertaken with an authorized foreign exchange dealer in Australia. Nonresident Accounts Financial institutions in Australia are permitted to offer accounts denominated in foreign currencies, but purchases and sales of foreign currency must be handled through authorized foreign exchange dealers in Aus- tralia. However, special rules apply to central banks, foreign governments, and foreign government agencies not similar to private sector commercial entities; basic- ally, they may hold essential working balances and are not permitted to invest at interest. Nonresidents may withdraw their balances without restriction. Imports and Import Payments Nearly all goods may be imported without import licenses, and no restrictions are imposed on payments for imports. Import restrictions, including quotas, are im- posed on a small range of goods, although not for exchange control purposes; the restrictions are main- tained mainly for reasons of industry assistance, health, community protection, or security, or to sustain quality standards. There is provision in the Customs Tariff Antidumping Act 1975 for action to be taken when dumped imports have caused, are causing, or are threatening material injury to Australian industries. Dumping duties may be imposed unless the exporters voluntarily raise their export prices to the level necessary to remove injury. During 1983 a total of 101 complaints of alleged dumping were received, of which 51 were pursued. A total of 67 cases were completed during the year, of which 23 resulted in the imposition of dumping duties or the acceptance of price undertakings by the overseas exporter. 3Foreign currencies are defined as all currencies other than the Australian dollar. 97 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution AUSTRALIA Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles are not restricted, subject to the Government's taxation screening requirements being met. (See section on Exchange Arrangement, above.) Travelers may take out of Australia up to $A 5,000 in Australian notes and coins in any combination. Travelers who are not residents of Australia may take out without formality any amount in foreign currency or Australian currency instruments (other than Australian currency notes and coins), provided that they brought them into Australia. Exports and Export Proceeds Export permits or licenses are not required except in respect of goods covered by the Export Control Act, Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations, and the Wildlife Protection Regulation of Exports and Imports Act. There are no formalities covering the disposal of export proceeds. Under the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations, the export of certain minerals and metals and of hydrocarbons and nuclear-sensitive material is pro- hibited unless permission is granted by the Minister for Trade or an authorized person. Exports are controlled for different objectives for individual mineral commodities, principally to ensure that: (a) pricing and other contractual conditions are fair in relation to the market, consistent with maximizing the trade benefits for Australia; (b) exports are in compliance with Australia's interna- tional obligations and bilateral agreements where appli- cable, e .g ., the Treaty of the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, as well as bilateral agreements be- tween Australia and each of its nuclear customer countries; (c) supplies are adequate for domestic requirements; and (d) the provisions of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act and the Australian Heritage Commission Act are met. There are active controls in respect of alumina, bauxite, coal, iron ore, crude oil, liquefied natural gas, primary t in, and uranium and other materials of nuclear significance. Exporters are required to consult with the relevant government department prior to negotiations for sales of alumina, bauxite, and coal. Determinations are made in relation to the negotiation of contracts for the sale of uran ium. Exporters of ores, concentrates, matte and oxides of copper, lead, manganese, nickel, tungsten and zinc, blister and refined copper, lead bullion, salt, petroleum products, liquefied petroleum gas and conden- sate are, on application, given automatic approval to export expected shipments over designated periods. Approvals to export minerals sands are freely issued, except when the Government considers there are en- vironmental reasons that would make such exports undesirable. With respect to exports of monazite and 98 xenotime, additional requirements must be met in rela- tion to the Government's nuclear safeguards policy before export approval can be given. Exports of copper scrap and copper alloy scrap are embargoed, and quotas apply to secondary copper ingots and other basic shapes made from scrap material. Export of petroleum and petroleum products to South Africa is prohibited. No other minerals are subject to control. Export control arrangements for coal, bauxite, alumina, and tin are under review. With respect to rural commodities, the Government follows the general principle that exporters should be the main negotiators for export contracts and that the market should determine prices. Generally, the export control power is not used but is held in reserve to be used if and when the need arises, consistent with the need to protect the national interest and to meet market access limita- tions imposed by importing countries. There are also provisions for government control over the export of defense material. Proceeds from Invisibles Earnings of invisibles in foreign currencies may be retained or sold for Australian dollars. Travelers may bring in any amount in foreign or domestic bank notes. Capital Borrowings in Australia by foreign governments, their agencies not similar to private sector commercial enti- ties, and international organizations are not permitted. Investment at interest in Australia is not permitted to foreign governments, their agencies not similar to private sector commercial entities, and central banks. Apart from these provisions and subject to the procedural requirements of the Government's taxation screening arrangements being met, transfers of capital from Aus- tralia and nonresident investments at interest in Australia may be undertaken without formality. Direct investment in Australia by nonresidents is governed by the Government's foreign investment pol- icy. The Australian Government's foreign investment policy is based on a recognition of the significant contribution that foreign capital can make to the devel- opment of Australia's industries and resources and the scope it provides for higher rates of growth in economic activity and employment than would otherwise be the case. The Government's policy is to encourage foreign investment, provided that such investment is consistent with Australia's national interests and meets the needs of the Australian community. Australia's foreign invest- ment policy is concerned primarily with direct foreign investment that has significant implications for the levels of foreign ownership and foreign control of Australian industries and resources. Portfolio debt and equity investment is not subject to the policy. Certain types of investment proposals are subject to examination by the Foreign Investment Review Board, which is the advisory body to the Government on foreign ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution investment matters. Proposals subject to review include those falling within the scope of the Foreign Takeovers Act, those involving the establishment of a new business or project, irrespective of size, in industries subject to special restrictions (the media and civil aviation), or in other sectors where the total amount of the investment is $A 10 million or more (including diversification into activities not previously undertaken directly in Australia and new projects in mining and primary industries), those involving direct investment by foreign govern- ments or their agencies (excluding investments related to their official representation), and those to acquire real estate and undertake real estate development projects. The Foreign Takeovers Act is concerned with the acquisition of companies or businesses operating in Australia by foreign interests. The Act requires nonresi- dents, nonresident-controlled corporations or businesses, and Australian companies in which nonresidents have a substantial shareholding to notify the Government of proposals to acquire, or alter, a substantial interest in a company. A substantial foreign interest is an interest of 15 percent or more in the ownership or voting power of a corporation or business by a single foreign interest, either alone or together with associates, or an interest of 40 percent or more in aggregate in the ownership or voting power of a corporation or business by two or more foreign interests and their associates. Foreign investment proposals are examined by the Government to ensure that they are consistent with Australia's interests. In particular, the examination process is directed toward ensuring that proposed invest- ments offer economic benefits sufficient to offset any loss of Australian ownership and control. The economic benefits are assessed in very broad terms covering such factors as employment-creating effects, more efficient use of resources, introduction of new technology, indus- try rationalization, and price or cost effects. Specific guidelines for Australian participation (gener- ally 50 percent Australian equity and control) apply to proposals for new mining and primary industry projects and, in certain circumstances, to the acquisition of real estate. These guidelines are applied flexibly. In con- sidering proposals for investment in sectors of the economy not subject to the equity guidelines, due credit is given to those that provide for participation by Australian interests in the ownership, control, and management of the business venture, although such participation may not be a necessary condition for approval. Proposed new businesses in the nonbank finance sector and in the insurance sector involving investment of $A 10 million or more and takeovers of existing businesses in these sectors are subject to examination. Proposals involving nonbank financial intermediaries (such as merchant banks and finance and leasing compa- nies) are approved unless they are considered to be contrary to the national interest. Proposals involving insurance companies are subject to the general foreign investment policy criteria, including the requirement for AUSTRALIA net economic benefits. New business proposals in both the nonbank finance sector and the insurance sector involving investment of less than $A 10 million are exempt from foreign investment screening. After inviting applications for banking licenses, the Government selected 16 foreign banks to establish banking operations in Australia. It is not envisaged that further invitations will be issued to foreign interests to establish banking operations in Australia. Australia's foreign investment policy provides an incentive for the "naturalization" of predominantly foreign-owned companies. The naturalization process is an entirely voluntary one for those companies that choose to increase the level of Australian participation in their Australian operations. Companies that elect to participate in the naturalization arrangements are entitled to certain benefits while they are naturalizing. In particu- lar, they are accorded prior credit for achieving majority Australian ownership, thereby facilitating their partici- pation in mining projects and ventures that are subject to the Australian equity participation guidelines. In the administration of foreign investment policy, every effort is made to avoid unnecessary interference in normal commercial processes. Recognition is given to the special characteristics and circumstances that may arise in individual cases, and the policy is nondis- criminatory as to the country of origin of investors. Foreign-controlled companies incorporated in Aus- tralia, or operating in Australia as locally registered foreign companies, may raise funds for their local requirements in the Australian capital market. Such foreign companies proposing to borrow locally are invited to consider alternative sources of financing, including the raising of local equity by means of new share issues or other placements.4 Gold There are no restrictions on residents owning, buy ing, or selling gold and gold coin in Australia. Residents may export and import gold other than Krugerrands, subject to normal customs procedures. However, the export of Australian gold coin in excess of five of the $A 200 denomination requires Reserve Bank approval. Changes During 1985 Capital January 15. It was announced that while foreign banks (other than central banks) and foreign government agencies similar to private sector commercial entities could undertake interest-bearing investments in Aus- tralia, the general restriction on such investments by foreign governments and their agencies not similar to private sector entities would continue.

The following modifications to foreign investment policy were announced: (a) the requirement that foreign parties to intended acquisitions of significant Australian businesses, rural properties, and real estate should demonstrate that sufficient opportunities to pur- chase such assets had been provided for Australians (such as by public announcement) would be discon- tinued; (b) the administrative threshold for acquisition proposals, below which approval was still required but readily given in the absence of special circumstances, would be raised from $A 2 million to $A 5 million; (c) the threshold below which proposals to establish new businesses were exempted from the need for approval (other than the media and civil aviation) would be increased from $A 5 million to $A 10 million; (d) the total value of real estate that could be acquired without the need for approval would be raised from $A 350,000 to $A 600,000 and would apply on a cumulative basis; (e) all new business proposals involving nonbank financial intermediaries and insurance companies of less than $A 10 million would be exempt from foreign investment screening, and a liberalized stance in relation to foreign investment in merchant banking would con- tinue and would be extended to other nonbank financial intermediaries; (f) the 50 percent Australian equity guideline for the acquisition of real estate for devel- opment and subsequent resale to Australians would only apply to development ventures costing $A 10 million or more and/or taking more than five years to complete (the 50 percent Australian equity guideline for real estate acquisitions for development and subsequent retention by foreign interests would remain); and (g) acquisi- tions by foreign investors of existing mining exploration rights and offshore takeovers in which the Australian assets are worth $A 20 million or less would be exempted from the need to be notified under the Foreign Takeovers Act.

Not for Redistribution AUSTRIA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Austria is the Austrian Schilling. Without assuming any formal obligations, the authorities aim at maintaining a stable relation with the currencies participating in the European Monetary System (EMS). Forward premiums and discounts are, in principle, left to the interplay of market forces. On December 31, 1985 the authorized banks' buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were S 17.19 and S 17.20, respectively, per US$1. There are no exchange taxes or subsidies. Austria formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2 , 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from August 1, 1962. Administration of Control The Austrian National Bank administers exchange control and issues exchange licenses where required. Most exchange transactions are effected through Aus- trian banks authorized to implement the exchange con- trol regulations. The customs authorities issue freely and without delay licenses required for imports of liberalized goods. Licenses, if required, for other imports and for exports have to be obtained from the relevant ministry, namely, the Federal Ministry of Trade, Commerce, and Industry (Licensing Office) for industrial products or the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry for agricultural products. For products falling under monopoly, licenses are issued by the Ministry of Finance. Prescription of Currency Settlements with all countries may be made either in convertible currencies or through Free Schilling Ac- counts. The exchange control regulations generally are based on the distinction between member countries of the IMF or the OECD with which settlements take place in convertible currencies and other countries with which settlements are made in convertible currencies. Nonresident Accounts There are three categories of nonresident accounts in schillings: Free Schilling Accounts, Interim Accounts for nonresidents residing in member countries of the IMF or the OECD, and Blocked Accounts for nonresidents residing in other countries. Free Schilling Accounts may be freely opened by Austrian credit institutions on behalf of nonresidents without any formality other than a check by the credit institution of the nonresident status of the beneficiary when the schilling funds are obtained from the selling of freely convertible foreign currencies at a domestic credit institution. Such accounts may be freely credited with proceeds from the sale of convertible currencies by a nonresident to the Austrian National Bank, or to an authorized bank, as well as with payments permitted by the National Bank on the basis of a general or individual authorization. The accounts may be freely debited for payments to Austrian residents, who must, however, apply for individual licenses if they are to receive loans from nonresidents. Balances may be freely converted into any foreign currency. Transfers between these accounts are free. Interim Accounts and Blocked Accounts consist of funds that are due to nonresidents. General licenses permit their use for payments for many current and some capital transactions. The transfer abroad of funds in Interim Accounts and Blocked Accounts is subject to an individual license. Usually, licenses are granted freely if the funds belong to residents of countries that are members of the IMF or the OECD. Nonresidents may also maintain nonresident accounts in convertible foreign currencies. These accounts may be debited for the same purposes as Free Schilling Accounts and are subject to the same conditions. Imports and Import Payments All commodities not included in the Annexes to the Foreign Trade Law are free of import licensing and may be imported from any country without quantitative restriction. All goods included in the Annexes require licenses, but most are free of quantitative restriction. For many goods licenses are granted by the customs, at the time of clearance, irrespective of the country they are imported from. * Nearly all imports from GATT coun- tries, their associated territories, and some other coun- tries2 are liberalized. Austria's GATT liberalization is applied worldwide, except in respect of certain textiles and clothing as defined in Article XII, Section 1, of the Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles. i liberalized for import from a given group of countries may be freely imported from any country in the group, provided that the country of exportation and the country of production of the goods involved are in the same group. 2The fu ll list is as follows: Algeria, Andorra, Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Australia, Bahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bar- bados, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burund i, Cameroon, Canada, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Chile, Colombia, Congo, Cote d'lvoire, Cuba, Cyprus, Denmark (including Faeroe Islands and Greenland), Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Fiji, Finland, France, Gabon, The Gambia, Federal Republic of Germany, Ghana, Greece, Grenada, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, I ta ly, Jamaica, Democratic Kampuchea, Kenya, Kiribati, Korea, Kuwa i t, Lesotho, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, Malta, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mozambique, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Ni- ger, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Portugal, Qatar, Rwanda, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Sao Tom6 and Principe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, Tanzania, Togo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Tuvalu, Uganda, U .S .S .R ., United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, U ruguay, Vanua tu, People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, Yugoslavia, Zaire, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. 101 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution AUSTRIA The importation of coffee and sugar is governed by the international agreements for these commodities. Non- liberalized imports may be obtained under various procedures: namely, state trading, global quotas, bilat- eral quotas, and discretionary licensing. State trading covers tobacco in any form, ethyl alcohol, and salt. Global quotas apply to specified imports from GATT countries; such quotas apply only to potatoes, wheat, and cornstarch, preserved meat, wine, and certain medica- ments. Discretionary individual licensing is applicable to all other private imports not covered by the procedures listed above, including imports of certain textiles from specified countries. Licenses are usually granted if the imports concerned do not adversely affect domestic industries. Grains, milk and butter, and cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, and horses for slaughter and products from these animals for human consumption are imported in accordance with a special system of controls and regulations maintained under the Agricultural Marketing Law and the law governing livestock farming and trading, and the mar- keting of livestock produce (Viehwirtschaftsgesetz). Cer- tain agricultural products are subject to import levies. In some cases, import licenses are issued only to importers who have received export certificates from the countries of their trading partners. Import licenses are not transferable and are valid for six months, but this period may be extended for periods of three months at a time. Payments for imports from, and originating in, countries with which Austria makes settlements in convertible currencies do not require exchange licenses. Under the 1982 Customs Preference Act, which covers the second ten-year period of the Austrian Scheme of Generalized Preferences, special treatment is provided for imports from the 31 least developed countries as defined by the UN General Assembly; the list of products eligible for preferential treatment has also been extended under the Act. Payments for Invisibles With few exceptions, residents are permitted to conclude transactions involving current invisibles with residents of countries that are members of the IMF or the OECD. Exceptions comprise certain transactions con- cerning transport and insurance. Most transactions in current invisibles that involve payments to residents of other countries (e.g., freight, commissions, and the cost of assembly and repairs) are covered by general licenses; for the remaining transactions, individual licenses are required. Payments on account of generally authorized invis- ibles to nonresidents may be made freely, provided that no capital transfer is involved. Other payments abroad up to S 2,000 may be made freely and at any time. The remaining payments on account of invisibles to countries other than members of the IMF and the OECD with which settlements are made in convertible currencies require special licenses. 102 Residents traveling to countries with which Austria makes settlements in convertible currencies may buy exchange from authorized banks or may obtain, as short- term advances from nonresidents in multilateral coun- tries, up to the equivalent of S 26,000 for each trip. Should a resident require more foreign exchange for traveling, additional amounts may be authorized by the National Bank. In addition, Austrian residents may arrange for trips abroad through travel agents and pay in schillings to cover expenditures for accommodation and food, as well as transportation. Persons leaving Austria may take w i th them S 15,000 in Austrian notes and coin and any amount in foreign notes and coin. Exports and Export Proceeds Licenses for exports regulated under the Foreign Trade Law have to be obtained from the relevant ministry or, at the time of clearance, from the customs authorities. For most exports, licenses are not required. Export licenses are issued with due consideration for the provisions of relevant bilateral trade agreements and the fu lf i l lment of quotas established in accordance with such agreements, and for the needs of the Austrian economy. Export claims exceeding the equivalent of S 50,000 must be declared. Export proceeds may either be surrendered or be deposited in accounts with authorized banks. Such deposits in convertible currencies may be used freely for authorized payments abroad. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles must be declared within eight days from the date of collection. They may either be surrendered or be deposited with an authorized bank and subsequently are used in the same way as proceeds accruing from exports. Persons entering Aus- tria may bring in Austrian or foreign bank notes and coin without limit. Capital The acquisition by nonresidents of Austrian securities, shares and participations in Austrian companies, and Austrian real estate is covered by a general license. In certain provinces, the acquisition of real estate is subject to the approval of the local authorities. Direct invest- ments by nonresidents are also permitted by general authorization, if made with convertible currencies or from free or originally owned blocked schilling balances; for investments financed in other ways, authorization is granted on the merits of each case. Loans and credits extended by nonresidents to resi- dents, including those in schillings from Free Schilling Accounts, at present require prior approval by the National Bank and, in many cases, are restricted. Approvals are granted generally, but not exclusively, for (1) investment credits for productive enterprises, (2) import and export finance, and (3) loans from nonresident relatives to residents. Import credit with a ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution maturity customary in the trade concerned is licensed freely. The short-term foreign assets and liabilities of autho- rized banks in convertible currencies are not subject to limitation. The National Bank licenses financial loans with maturities of more than one year to nonresidents only to the extent of funds made available through the redemption of such loans outstanding at the end of December of the previous year, plus 15 percent. A number of authorized banks are permitted to accept convertible currencies from abroad for interbank on- lending abroad at maturities of up to five years. Mort- gage loans, export finance credits, and loans to Austrian subsidiaries abroad are not subject to this limit. Transactions and operations mentioned in the follow- ing three paragraphs are licensed upon documentation, provided that they are concluded with residents of countries that are members of the IMF or the OECD. The National Bank permits the transfer abroad of (1) proceeds from the liquidation of various foreign investments in Austria (shares or participations in Aus- trian enterprises, Austrian securities, and real estate in Austria) and (2) repayments by residents of foreign loans and credits. The transfer of funds owned by emigrants and pay- ments due to nonresidents on account of dowries, inheritances, and settlements under certain agreements between heirs is permitted. Residents may also grant loans to nonresident relatives, provided that the lender draws on his own resources. Residents are allowed, for purposes of direct invest- ment, to acquire participation rights in foreign compa- nies, associations, and other enterprises, and to estab- lish, acquire, or extend foreign agencies or individually owned firms; earnings accruing from such investment usually may be reinvested. Residents also are permitted to acquire real estate abroad for the purpose of establish- ing a secondary residence, that is, intended for the personal use of the buyer within one year, to grant commercial or investment credits (provided that, in the latter case, the proceeds of the credit are used within Austria), to grant direct investment loans (provided that the resident can actually exert influence on the manage- ment of the nonresident enterprise), and to grant credits secured by mortgages in Austria or abroad. Domestic insurance companies may conclude life insurance con- tracts in Austria with nonresidents. Residents are allowed to purchase from nonresidents, without restriction, foreign securities that are (a) issued in member countries of the IMF or the OECD with which settlements take place in convertible currencies and (b) registered on stock exchanges3 and Austrian securi- 3The general license does not apply to the purchase by residents from nonresidents of securities of a participating nature in whatever legal form (including shares) that are issued by foreign investment funds or by similar institutions of whatever kind that assemble assets for the purpose of risk spreading. Individual licenses are issued automatically when the purchase takes place on a recognized foreign stock exchange or when the issuing institution is subject to adequate surveillance. AUSTRIA ties; for foreign securities and Austrian external bonds, the transactions must be carried out on a spot basis through authorized banks and, with certain exceptions (e.g., in the case of securities listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange), the securities purchased must be kept with such banks. Payments for these purchases to nonresi- dents may be made in convertible currencies. Residents may sell foreign securities and Austrian external bonds to nonresidents only on a spot basis against payment in convertible currencies and, for securities deposited with Austrian authorized banks, only through such banks. Gold Transactions in gold (excluding jewelry and medal- lions, which are considered jewelry) are governed by the Foreign Exchange Law. The National Bank is authorized by this law to deal in gold as defined therein; the Bank has granted a number of general permissions widely liberalizing the domestic gold trade, but does not itself buy or sell gold or gold coin, except in transactions with monetary authorities of other countries or with interna- tional financial institutions. The Bank has authorized credit institutions, exchange offices, and coin dealers to buy or sell in Austria on their own behalf or on behalf of their customers (including nonresidents) gold coin that is not legal tender; the prices are based on those for coin and unmanufactured gold in free markets abroad. A general license also permits other residents to purchase and sell among themselves, in Austria and against payment in schillings, gold coin that is not legal tender. The Mint releases certain types of gold coin (restrikes) to authorized credit institutions for resale to the public. It has also issued a commemorative gold coin with a face value of S 1,000, which is legal tender. Residents may hold gold in any form, including bars, in Austria, and they may acquire in Austria any gold coin that is not legal tender and any gold medals or medallions; further- more, domestic trading between residents in gold with a fineness of less than 0.585 is unrestricted. With the exception of coin, medals, and gold with a fineness of less than 0.585, the acquisition from residents of gold subject to the Foreign Exchange Law is reserved for the monetary authorities, authorized industrial users, den- tists, and jewelers; the Mint, gold refiners, and jewelers are permitted to trade or exchange gold in any form among themselves. Domestic sales of gold coins that are not legal tender (and thus tax free) are subject to value- added tax, which is at the general rate of 32 percent; as an exception, sales of all "Dukaten" coins are subject to value-added tax at the rate of 20 percent. Where the Foreign Trade Law prescribes import licenses for gold imports (e .g ., for gold sheets), the license is issued either by the Ministry of Trade, Commerce, and Industry to industrial users or by the customs office concerned, which issues licenses auto- matically for certain gold imports within its jurisdiction. Where this law does not require an import license (e .g ., for the import of gold bars), the Foreign Exchange Law prescribes a license issued by the National Bank 103 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution AUSTRIA covering the purchase of gold. Exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require authorization by the National Bank; the Bank has issued a general license permitting nonresident travelers to take out coin that is not legal tender up to a weight of 200 grams a person a trip and allowing resident travelers to specified member countries to export such coin up to a value of S 2,000 a person a trip. The National Bank's imports and exports do not require import, exchange, or export licenses. Commercial imports of jewelry and of articles containing a minor amount of gold, such as watches, are liberalized, licenses being issued automatically by the customs authorities; commercial exports of a number of such articles, however, must be licensed by the Ministry of Trade, Commerce, and Industry.

In the case of the seventh stage of the tariff cut, the implementation was one year ahead of schedule. 104 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution THE BAHAMAS1 (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of The Bahamas is the Bahamian Dollar, which is pegged to the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, at B$l = US$1. The U .S. dollar circulates concurrently with the Bahamian dollar. The official buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar are B$l.0025 and B$1.0040, respectively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates for the pound sterling are also officially quoted, the buying rate being based on the New York market mid-rate, and the selling rate 0.5 percent above the buying rate. The Central Bank of The Bahamas deals only with commercial banks. For transactions with the public, commercial banks are authorized to charge a commission of 0.50 percent buying and 0.75 percent selling, per US$1, and 0.50 percent buying or selling per £ stg. 1. These charges are additional to the Central Bank's charges. A stamp tax of B$0.10 is applied to all outward remittances where the amount is B$30 or less. A further tax of B$0.10 is levied on every additional B$30 or fraction thereof. There is also a market in which "investment cur- rency"2 may be negotiated between residents through an investment currency dealer at freely determined rates, usually attracting a premium over the official market rate. On December 31, 1985 the bid and offer rates reflecting this premium were 15 percent and 20 percent, respectively. The Bahamas formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agree- ment, as from December 5, 1973. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Central Bank, which delegates to authorized dealers the authority to approve allocations of foreign exchange for certain current payments; the approval authority for import payments, travel exchange, and cash gifts is not dele- gated, except in Grand Bahama and the Family Islands. Import and export licenses are not required except for crawfish, conch, arms and ammunition, and, in certain cases, industrial gold. The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries issues export licenses for crawfish and conch, and the Police Department issues import and export licenses for arms and ammunition. Prescription of Currency The exchange control system of The Bahamas makes no distinction between foreign territories. Settlements ^n June 16, 1986, the Bahamian authorities notified the Fund of the change in the country's name to The Bahamas. 2This is foreign currency in respect of which there is a general or specific central bank permission that it may be retained and used or disposed of as investment currency. Such permission may exist in respect of foreign currency accruing to residents of The Bahamas from the sale or redemption of foreign currency securities or the sale, liquidation, redemption, or realization of property or of direct investments outside The Bahamas. The use of investment currency is prescribed for the purchase from nonresidents of foreign currency securities and the making of direct investments outside The Bahamas. with residents of foreign countries may be made in any foreign currency3 or in Bahamian dollars through an External Account. Nonresident Accounts Authorized banks may freely open External Accounts denominated in Bahamian dollars for winter residents and for persons with residency permits who are not gainfully employed in The Bahamas. With the prior approval of the Central Bank, authorized banks may also open External Accounts in Bahamian dollars for nonresi- dent companies that have local expenses in The Bahamas and for nonresident investors. External Accounts in Bahamian dollars are normally funded entirely from foreign currency originating outside The Bahamas, but income on registered investments may also be credited to these accounts with the Central Bank's approval. Bal- ances may be converted freely into foreign currency and transferred abroad.4 Accounts which are credited with funds that may not be placed at the free disposal of nonresidents are designated Blocked Accounts. These are held mainly by emigrants. Where the value of an emigrant's assets exceeds B$25,000, the excess is credited to a Blocked Account. Balances on Blocked Accounts are transferable through the official exchange market after four years or through the investment currency market at any time; they may also be invested, with the Central Bank's approval, in certain resident-held assets or be spent locally for any other purpose. Imports and Import Payments The importation of certain commodities is prohibited or controlled because of health, social, or humanitarian reasons. All other goods may be imported without a license. The prior approval of the Central Bank is required for making payments for imports, irrespective of origin;5 this approval is normally given automatically upon submission of pro forma invoices or other relevant documents proving the existence of a purchase contract. Import duties vary from 0 to 200 percent, depending on the type of goods. Customs entries are subject to a stamp tax at a rate of I1/? percent. Payments for Invisibles There are no restrictions on current payments. Autho- rized dealers can make payments to nonresidents on behalf of residents for certain services and other invis- ibles within specified limits. Such payments include 3Foreign currencies comprise all currencies other than the Bahamian dollar. 4Persons of foreign nationality who have been granted "temporary resident" status are treated in some respects as nonresidents but are not permitted to hold External Accounts in Bahamian dollars. 5Except in Grand Bahama and the Family Islands, where this authority is delegated to clearing bank branches. 105 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution THE BAHAMAS freight, ships' disbursements, commissions, royalties, and insurance payments. Residents are entitled, on application to the Central Bank, to a foreign currency travel allowance of the equivalent of B$l ,000 a person a year for tourist travel and of B$5,000 a person a year for genuine business or professional travel. The allowance of B$ 1,000 for tourist travel excludes the cost of fares and travel services, which are normally obtained against payment in Bahamian dollars to a travel agent in The Bahamas. Applications for foreign exchange in excess of these amounts must be referred to the Central Bank, which approves bona fide applications. Foreign ex- change facilities obtained for travel may not be retained abroad or be used abroad for purposes other than travel; any unused balance must be surrendered within a week of issue or, if the traveler is still abroad, within one week of his return to The Bahamas. Subject to adequate documentary evidence, an education allowance of up to B$6,000 a person an academic year is normally granted upon application. Applications for facilities in excess of this amount are referred to the Central Bank. Temporary residents may, with the approval of the Central Bank, remit up to 50 percent of their wages and salaries, but where commitments outside The Bahamas are larger than 50 percent of wages and salaries, additional amounts may be remitted. A traveler may take out Bahamian banknotes not exceeding B$70 in value; Bahamian travelers may take out notes of any other country not exceeding US$ 1,000 in value. Exports and Export Proceeds Export licenses are not required except for crawfish, conch, and arms and ammunition. The proceeds of exports must be offered for sale to an authorized dealer as soon as the goods have reached their destination or within six months of shipment; alternatively, export proceeds may be used in any manner acceptable to the Central Bank. Proceeds from Invisibles Residents are obliged to collect without delay all amounts due to them from nonresidents and to offer the foreign currency proceeds for sale to an authorized dealer without delay, but these requirements are seldom enforced. There are no restrictions on the import of foreign bank notes. The import of domestic bank notes is subject to the approval of the Central Bank. Capital All capital transfers to countries outside The Bahamas require exchange control approval, and outflows of resident-owned capital are restricted. Inward transfers do not require exchange control approval, although the subsequent utilization of the funds in The Bahamas may require authorization. The permission of the Central Bank is required in respect of any action whereby nonresidents acquire control of or participate in an incorporated company controlled by residents. Resident 106 individuals and companies require the specific permis- sion of the Central Bank to maintain bank accounts outside The Bahamas.6 The use of official exchange for direct investment abroad is limited to B$ 100,000 or 30 percent of the total cost of the investment, whichever is greater, for invest- ments from which the additional benefits expected to accrue to the balance of payments from export receipts, profits, or other earnings within 18 months of the investment will at least equal the total amount of investment and will continue thereafter. Investments abroad that do not meet the above criteria may be financed by foreign currency borrowed on suitable terms subject to individual approval by the Central Bank, the purchase of foreign currency in the investment currency market, or the use of retained profits of foreign sub- sidiary companies. Permission is not given for invest- ments that are likely to have adverse effects on the balance of payments. In principle, inward investment by nonresidents is unrestricted. However, the consent of the Central Bank is required for the issue or transfer of shares in a Bahamian company to a nonresident and for the transfer of control of a Bahamian company to a nonresident. Special procedures apply to investments in the form of purchase of real property, as specified under the Immov- able Property (Acquisition by Foreign Persons) Act, 1981, which came into effect on November 1, 1983: foreigners intending to purchase land must make applica- tion to the Foreign Investments Board, a group of designated ministers of the Government. If such applica- tion is approved, payment for the purchase may be made either in Bahamian dollars from an External Account or in foreign currency. For all investments with approved status, permission is given upon application for the transfer of profits and dividends, representing earned trading profits and invest- ment income. In the event of a sale or liquidation, nonresident investors are permitted to repatriate the proceeds, including any capital appreciation, through the official foreign exchange market. Residents require the specific approval of the Central Bank to buy property outside The Bahamas; such purchases, if for personal use, can be made only with investment currency, and approval is limited to one property for each family. Any incidental expenses connected with the purchase of property for personal use may normally be met with investment currency; expendi- tures necessary for the maintenance of the property or arising directly from its ownership may, with permis- sion, be met with foreign currency bought at the current market rate in the official foreign exchange market. The transfer of legacies and inheritances due to nonresident beneficiaries under wills or intestacies of persons who were Bahamian residents at the time of their 6Banks and trusts established in The Bahamas are exempt from certain exchange control regulations, particularly with regard to their offshore operations. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution death is permitted. However, permission is not normally given for Bahamian residents to settle any property, other than by will, for the benefit of nonresidents, in line with the provisions of the Immovable Property (Acquisi- tion by Foreign Persons) Act 1981. A resident may make cash gifts to nonresidents not exceeding a total of B$ 1,000 a donor each year. This amount may be exceeded, with permission, in special circumstances. Foreign nationals domiciled in The Bahamas, even if considered resident for exchange control purposes, may be eligible for a measure of exemption from certain exchange control obligations, notably with respect to the mandatory deposit of foreign currency securities and the surrender of certain other foreign capital assets. Nonresident buyers of Bahamian securities must pay for such purchases in Bahamian dollars from an External Account, in funds eligible for credit to an External Account, or in Bahamian dollars arising from the sale of foreign currency in the official foreign exchange market; interest, dividends, and capital payments on such securi- ties may not be remitted outside The Bahamas unless the holdings have been properly acquired by nonresidents. Bahamian residents are not permitted to purchase foreign currency securities with official exchange or out of export proceeds or other current earnings; payment must be made with investment currency. All purchases, sales, and switches of foreign currency securities in The Bahamas and all switches in foreign currency securities by Bahamian residents, wherever the switch takes place, require permission from the Central Bank, and all transactions must take place through authorized agents.7 All foreign securities purchased by residents of The Bahamas must be held to the order of an authorized agent. Securities of other former Sterling Area countries are considered foreign currency securities, and sales proceeds of such securities held by residents, if regis- tered at the Central Bank by December 31, 1972, are eligible for sale in the investment currency market; securities not so registered may be offered for sale at the official rate of exchange. Residents leaving the country with the intention of residing permanently outside The Bahamas are redesig- nated upon departure as nonresidents. Under normal rules persons leaving The Bahamas to take up residence elsewhere may transfer, at the current market rate in the official foreign exchange market, up to B$25,000 of their Bahamian dollar assets to the new country of residence, and may also take normal household and personal effects with them. When the total value of their Bahamian dollar assets is over B$25,000, the excess is transferable through the official exchange market after four years, or through the investment currency market at any time. After a person's redesignation as a nonresi- dent, income accruing from his assets remaining in The 7These are 12 banks and trust companies authorized to deal in Bahamian and foreign currency securities and to receive securities in deposit. THE BAHAMAS Bahamas is normally remittable at the current market rate in the official foreign exchange market. Residents other than authorized banks require permis- sion to borrow foreign currency from nonresidents, and authorized dealers are subject to exchange control directions with regard to their lending of foreign cur- rency to residents. Residents also require permission to pay interest on, and to repay the principal of, foreign currency loans by conversion of Bahamian dollars. When permission is granted for residents to accept foreign currency loans, such permission is normally conditional upon the currency being offered for sale without delay to an authorized dealer, unless the funds are required to meet payments to nonresidents for which permission has been specifically given. A resident company that is wholly owned by nonresi- dents is not normally allowed to raise working capital in Bahamian dollars unless such funds are a small propor- tion of the total investment. If the company is partly owned by residents, the amount of such local currency borrowing is normally determined in relation to the resident interest in the equity of the company. Banks and other lenders resident in The Bahamas require permis- sion before they extend loans in domestic currency to any corporate body (other than a bank), which is resident in The Bahamas and is by any means controlled, whether directly or indirectly, by nonresidents. However, compa- nies that are set up by nonresidents primarily to im- port and distribute products manufactured outside The Bahamas are not normally allowed to borrow Bahamian dollars from residents either for fixed or working capital but must provide all their finance in foreign currency; borrowings in a foreign currency normally are permitted on application. Gold Residents of The Bahamas other than authorized dealers are not permitted to hold or deal in gold bullion. Those residents, however, who are known users of gold for industrial purposes may, with the approval of the Central Bank, meet their current industrial requirements. Authorized dealers are not required to obtain licenses for bullion or coin. Commercial imports of gold jewelry do not require a license. There is no import duty on gold bullion or gold coin; however, an import duty of 35 percent is imposed on imports of gold jewelry from all sources. A 1.5 percent stamp tax payable to the customs is also payable on commercial shipments of gold jewelry from any source. There is no restriction on the acquisition or retention by residents of gold coin. The Bahamas has issued commemorative coins in denomina- tions of B$10, B$20, B$50, B$100, B$150, B$200, B$250, B$l,000, and B$2,500 in gold, and B$10 and B$25 in silver; these are legal tender but do not circulate. Changes During 1985 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 107 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BAHRAIN (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Bahrain is the Bahrain Dinar, which is pegged to the SDR at the rate of BD 0.476190 = SDR 1. Bahrain sets exchange rates for the Bahrain dinar within margins of plus or minus 7.25 percent of the fixed relationship between the Bahrain dinar and the SDR; in practice, the Bahrain dinar maintains a relatively stable relationship with the U.S. dollar, the intervention cur- rency. Since December 1980, the exchange rate has remained unchanged at BD 1 = US$2.6596. With the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies, the exchange rate of the dinar in terms of the SDR has been outside the 7.25 percent margin since May 1981. The middle rate of the Bahrain dinar for the U.S. dollar quoted by the Bahrain Monetary Agency (BMA) is adjusted from time to time. The Agency also quotes daily rates for the pound sterling and the deutsche mark based on the latest available rates for the U.S. dollar against those currencies. On December 31, 1985 the Agency's buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were BD 0.375 and BD 0.377, respectively, per US$1. The Agency does not deal with the public. In their dealings with the public, commercial banks are required to use the Agency's rates for U.S. dollars, pounds sterling, and deutsche mark, but they are authorized to charge an exchange commission of 2 per mill (special rates of commission apply for transactions up to BD 1,000). The banks' rates for other currencies are based on the Agency's rates for the U .S. dollar and the New York market rate for the currency concerned against the U .S. dollar. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Bahrain formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from March 20, 1973. Administration of Control The Agency is the exchange control authority, but there is no exchange control legislation in Bahrain. No import or export licenses are required (except for arms and ammunition, television cameras, and alcoholic beverages). However, importers and exporters must be registered with the commercial registry maintained by the Ministry of Commerce and Agriculture and must be members of the Bahrain Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Prescription of Currency All settlements with Israel are prohibited. Otherwise, no requirements are imposed on exchange payments or receipts. Nonresident Accounts A distinction is made between accounts held by residents and those held by nonresidents. Offshore banking units are not normally permitted to hold resident accounts. 108 Imports and Import Payments All imports from Israel are prohibited, as are products manufactured by foreign companies that are blacklisted by the League of Arab States. Imports of a few commodities are prohibited from all sources for reasons of health, public policy, or security. Imports of cultured pearls also are prohibited. Import licenses are required for arms and ammunition, television cameras, and alcoholic beverages. Rice and sugar are, in practice, imported only by the Bahrain Import-Export Company. Exchange for payments in respect of permitted imports may be obtained freely. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Israel are prohibited, and exports of certain refined petroleum products to South Africa have been suspended. Otherwise, all commodities may be exported freely. There are no requirements attached to receipts from exports or re-exports; the proceeds need not be repatriated or surrendered, and they may be disposed of freely, regardless of the currency involved. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments for and proceeds from invisibles are not restricted, except that payments must not be made to or received from Israel. Travelers may bring in or take out of Bahrain any amount in domestic or foreign bank notes. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or payments by residents or nonresidents, but payments may not be made to or received from Israel. Profits from foreign investments in Bahrain may be transferred abroad freely, with the exception that under Article 72 of the Monetary Agency Law the banks are subject to special rules regarding the payment of dividends and the remittance of their profits. Licensed offshore banking units may freely engage in transactions with nonresidents; transactions with residents are not normally permitted. The Ministry of Commerce and Agriculture operates a center for the dissemination of information on the stock exchange. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form are freely permitted and do not require a license. Imports of gold jewelry are subject to a 10 percent customs duty but gold ingots are exempt. Brokerage business in gold (as well as other com- modities) requires approval from the Bahrain Monetary Agency before registering with the Ministry of Com- merce and Agriculture; such business is subject to a minimum deposit requirement equivalent in the case of ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution gold to BD 3,000 or 10 percent of the contract value, whichever is higher. Changes During 1985 Capital June 1. The Bahrain Monetary Agency (BMA) re- duced by 0.5 percentage point its recommended max- imum rate of interest on deposits in Bahrain dinar, while increasing by 0.5 percent over the Bahrain dinar deposit rate, its recommended rate for certificates of deposit of BD 30>000 and above for periods up to one year. August 1. It was announced that all money changers should obtain approval from the BMA before registering with the Ministry of Commerce and Agriculture. BAHRAIN 109 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BANGLADESH (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Bangladesh is the Bangladesh Taka. The value of the taka in terms of the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, is determined on the basis of a weighted basket of currencies. Changes in the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar are generally made when fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U .S. dollar and the currencies in the basket exceed 1 percent in either direction. On December 31, 1985 the official (spot) middle rate of the taka in terms of the U .S. dollar was Tk 31.00 = US$1. On December 31, 1985 the spot buying and selling rates of the Bangladesh Bank (the central bank) for authorized dealers were Tk 30.97 and Tk 31.03, respectively, per US$1. On the same date the spot buying and selling rates (telegraphic transfers) of authorized dealers were Tk 30.9387 and Tk 31.0613, respectively, per US$1. Exchange rates for currencies other than the U .S. dollar are based on the U.S. dollar daily closing rates in New York for the currencies concerned. Different effective exchange rates arise through the operation of the Wage Earners' Scheme and the Export Performance Benefit Scheme. Under the former scheme, exchange earnings remitted by workers abroad are auctioned or sold by the wage earners or their representatives to eligible users or banks on a bilateral basis at rates established by a Wage Earners' Rates Committee constituted by the Bangladesh Bank; foreign exchange purchased under this scheme may be used for specified imports, expenditure on foreign travel, and other approved purposes. Under the Export Performance Benefit Scheme, export receipts from about 45 (mainly nontraditional) products are sold in the secondary mar- ket, together with workers' remittances and tourist receipts. All other nontraditional export items receive a "secondary market sale" coefficient of either 70 percent or 40 percent, depending on domestic value added; the corresponding percentage of export receipts from these items are also sold in the secondary market. Following introduction of the scheme, about 42 percent of export receipts are transacted at the secondary market rate. Receipts from consultancy and technical fees are also eligible to be sold in the secondary market. On Decem- ber 31, 1985 the middle exchange rate in the secondary market was Tk 33.4750 per US$1 and Tk 48.3950 per £ stg. Forward transactions of the Bangladesh Bank are confined to purchases and sales of deutsche mark, French francs, Japanese yen, pounds sterling, U.S. dol- lars, and all currencies of the member countries of the Asian Clearing Un ion .l Forward facilities at authorized banks covering periods of up to six months are available in all approved foreign currencies for export proceeds 1 Members of the Asian Clearing Union are Bangladesh, Burma, India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. 110 and for import payments. Forward exchange facilities for three months are available for remittances of surplus collection of foreign shipping companies and foreign airlines. For settlement of transactions under the Asian Clearing Union, the Bangladesh Bank also pur- chases, both spot and forward, the Asian Monetary Unit (AMU);2 it also sells the AMU for spot delivery. Upon payment of an annual premium of 2.5 percent, the exchange risk on public or private foreign currency loans that will be fully or partly disbursed by June 30, 1988 may be given forward exchange cover by the Bangladesh Bank under the Exchange Rate Fluctuation Burden Absorption Scheme. The full amount of the exchange risk may be covered in respect of loans disbursed after July 1, 1983, but the scheme applies to only a specified proportion of loans fully disbursed prior to that date. The scheme also permits lending institutions to convert into preferred shares or debentures a part of exchange losses on foreign currency loans outstanding on June 30, 1983 and on which there are overdue payments. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Bangladesh Bank in accordance with general policy formulated in consultation with the Ministry of Finance. The seven foreign and ten domestic commercial banks (of which four are nationalized), together with two joint-venture banks and three specialized financial institutions, have been appointed authorized dealers (authorized banks) in foreign exchange. The Chief Controller of Imports and Exports of the Ministry of Commerce is responsible for the issuance of import licenses. Certain trade transac- tions are conducted through state-trading agencies, in- cluding the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB). Prescription of Currency Settlements with all countries are subject to exchange control. Settlements with countries with which Bangla- desh has commodity exchange agreements3 normally must be effected through nonconvertible U .S. dollar or pound sterling accounts for goods and services specified in the agreements and up to agreed value limits; settlement with these countries can be made in convert- ible currencies for goods and services not specified in the agreements or beyond the value ceilings specified in the agreements. Payments to, and receipts from, the other member countries of the Asian Clearing Union in respect of current transactions must be effected in Asian Mone- 2The AMU is equivalent in value to the SDR and is used for recording the value of transactions passing through the Union. 3Bulgaria, People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Poland, Romania, U .S .S .R ., and Yugoslavia. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution tary Units through the Clearing Union.4 Settlements with other countries normally take place in sterling and other convertible currencies, and in few cases, through Non- resident Taka Accounts. Payments for imports may be made to the country of origin of the goods or to any other country (with the exception of those countries from which importation is prohibited); they may be made (1) in taka for credit to a nonresident bank account in Bangladesh of the country concerned; (2) in the currency of the country concerned; or (3) in any freely convertible currency. Export proceeds must be received in freely convertible foreign exchange or in taka from a Nonresi- dent Taka Account. All settlements with Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts The accounts of individuals, firms, or companies resident in countries outside Bangladesh are designated Nonresident Accounts. All such accounts are regarded for exchange control purposes as accounts related to the country in which the account holder is a perma- nent resident.5 Nonresident Accounts may be opened only with the prior approval of the Bangladesh Bank. Specified debits and credits to Nonresident Accounts may be made by authorized dealers without the prior approval of the Bangladesh Bank during the absence of the account holder from Bangladesh. Certain other debits and credits may be made without the prior approval of the Bangladesh Bank but are subject to reporting ex post. Convertible Taka Accounts. All diplomatic missions operating in Bangladesh, their diplomatic officers, home-based members of the mission staffs, international nonprofit humanitarian organizations functioning in Ban- gladesh and their expatriate employees, foreign contrac- tors and consultants engaged in specific projects, and foreign nationals residing in Bangladesh regardless of their status are allowed to maintain Convertible Taka Accounts. These accounts may be credited freely with the proceeds of inward remittances in convertible foreign exchange and may be debited freely and at any time for local disbursements in taka, as well as for remittances abroad in convertible currencies. Transfers between Convertible Taka Accounts are freely permitted. Foreign missions and embassies may open interest-bearing ac- counts, but the interest earned thereon can be disbursed only in local currency. Wage Earners' Scheme. Under the Wage Earners' Scheme, Bangladesh nationals and persons of Bangla- desh origin who are working abroad are permitted to open Foreign Currency Accounts denominated in pounds sterling or U .S. dollars. These accounts may be credited with (1) remittances in convertible currencies received from abroad through normal banking and postal chan- nels; (2) proceeds of convertible currencies (currency 4Exchange rates for transactions under the ACU are calculated and announced on the basis of daily IMF quotations of the exchange rates of the currencies of the ACU member countries in terms of SDR. 5The accounts of the United Nations and its agencies are treated as resident accounts.

The accounts may be debited, without restriction, but subject to reporting to the Bangladesh Bank, for the following purposes: (1) all local disbursements; (2) transfers to other Foreign Currency Accounts opened under the Wage Earners' Scheme; (3) payment for imports of specified goods against letters of credit; (4) payment of bank commissions and other bank charges connected with the handling of the accounts; and (5) travel expenditures abroad for business or private purposes up to the equivalent of US$200 a year (regard- less of the number of visits annually) for travel by air to Burma, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, up to an overall annual travel allocation of US$1,800 a person and a maximum of US$1,000 a trip for travel to other countries, and up to US$150 a year for overland travel to India. Nonresident Foreign Currency Deposit Accounts. Bangladesh nationals and persons of Bangladesh origin may also open Nonresident Foreign Currency Deposit Accounts, denominated in pounds sterling or U .S. dol- lars. These accounts, which range in term from one month to one year, may be credited, in initial minimum amounts of US$1,000 or £ stg. 500, with (1) remittances in convertible currencies, and (2) transfers from existing Foreign Currency Accounts maintained under the Wage Earners' Scheme. The banks pay interest on balances in these accounts at Eurocurrency deposit rates. The bal- ance, including interest earned, may be transferred in foreign exchange by the account holder to his country of residence or anywhere he chooses; the account holder, if he is not otherwise ineligible under the Wage Earners' Scheme, may also transfer the balance to any Foreign Currency Account maintained under the Wage Earners' Scheme. The balances in the accounts, which are freely convertible into taka at the official rate, must be re- ported monthly to the Bangladesh Bank and the accounts must be closed within six months or on maturity of the deposit, whichever is later, upon the taking up of permanent residence by the account holder in Bangladesh. Imports and Import Payments Imports are financed either from Bangladesh's own resources or with foreign aid, loans, and baiter ar- rangements. Imports other than foodgrains, fertilizers, and items financed by project aid are licensed within the framework of an annual import policy (import budget). The Import Policy Order (IPO) for the fiscal year 1985/86 (July to June) is based on two lists, the Negative List and the Restricted List. The Negative List includes some 200 items for which importation is totally banned either for social or religious reasons or because similar items are locally produced. The Restricted List includes in ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BANGLADESH items that may be imported only if certain conditions relating mainly to quality and nature of end users are met. Items not on these lists are freely importable through the secondary market, provided that the importer has a valid import registration certificate, which is readily obtainable. Imports at the official exchange rate are subject to allocation on the basis of foreign exchange availability. Cash allocations are granted for the importa- tion at the official exchange rate of, inter alia, books, technology, certain spare parts and machinery, and special materials and equipment for certain export- oriented sectors. The IPO also stipulates that (i) imports under any financing arrangement other than tied credits are not permitted unless existing facilities under barter arrangements have been fu l ly utilized; and (ii) importa- tion of 26 items through the secondary market is permissible only to registered commercial importers. All importers are issued with passbooks containing informa- tion on their business and service, as well as a record of restrictions or exemptions affecting their ability to import. The Import Policy Order prohibits or restricts imports of some raw materials or inputs, certain textiles, factory rejects, goods of substandard quality, used items, and materials inimical to public order or religious beliefs. With the exception of imports by government depart- ments, letter of credit authorization forms (LCAFs) are required of all registered importers for all imports. Under the authority of the Import Policy Order issued by the Chief Controller, registered commercial importers are allowed to effect imports against LCAFs issued by authorized dealer banks without the need for an import license. For imports under the Wage Earners' Scheme, an importer is required to have a valid import registration certificate either as a commercial importer or industrial consumer or under the Wage Earners' Scheme. These documents are issued by a licensing office of the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports. Single country LCAFs are issued for imports under bilateral trade or payments agreements and for imports under tied aid programs. LCAFs are valid worldwide, except that imports from Israel and South Africa and imports transported on the flag vessels of Taiwant, Israel, and South Africa are prohibited. For shipment of imports under cash and the secondary exchange market scheme, the validity of LCAFs is as follows: (1) 11 months from the date of registration of a LCAF for commercial items and industrial raw and packing materials; and (2) 17 months from the date of registration of a LCAF for the importation of capital machinery and spare parts. If these documents lapse for reasons beyond the control of the importer they may be revalidated by the licensing authority. Authorized dealers may, subsequent to the month of registration of the above documents, allow remittances within a period of 12 months for the importation of commercial items and industrial raw materials and packing materials and up to 18 months for the importation of capital machinery and spare parts. If tSee Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part Two, page 75. 112 the importers require further time to make remittances, then authorized dealers may allow such remittances only under the Wage Earners' Scheme. Payment against imports is generally permissible only under cover of irrevocable letters of credit. Under the Wage Earners' Scheme a provision exists for the importation of machinery and equipment against letters of credit opened on a deferred payment basis for up to 360 days. Firms dealing in recognized export-oriented ready-made garments and specialized textile and hosiery units operating under the bonded warehouse system may effect imports of their raw and packing materials by opening letters of credit of up to 180 days deferred- payment term against export letters of credit received by them. Opening of letters of credit for industrial imports and specified essential commercial imports in the private sector is subject to margin requirements ranging from 5 percent to 25 percent; for nonessential commercial imports, the minimum margin requirements range from 25 percent to 50 percent. There is no minimum margin requirement for opening of import letters of credit for raw and packaging materials against export letters of credit received by export-oriented ready-made garment units. For public sector importers, the minimum margin requirement for opening of letters of credit is 5 percent. Imports of books and periodicals up to specified limits are permissible on a consignment basis. Public sector importers, however, may import on a cash-against- documents basis. Imports of specified raw materials and packing mate- rials by industrial consumers is, subject to the availabil- ity of fund s, governed by an entitlement system, based on the requirements for various industries during each import program period as established by the Director- General of Industries. Firms in the industrial sector are given an entitlement for importation of specified raw materials and packing materials, and letter of credit authorization forms are issued on the basis of the entitlement. The entitlement system does not apply, however, to raw materials and packing materials that are imported under the Wage Earners' Scheme. Separately, industrial consumers may be issued with LCAFs for parts and accessories of machinery. Goods imported against LCAFs issued to industrial consumers must be used in the industry concerned and must not be sold or transferred without prior approval. Foreign exchange for authorized imports is provided automatically by authorized dealers when payments are due. Advance payments for imports require approval by the Bangladesh Bank, which normally is given only for specialized or capital goods. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles connected with authorized trade transactions generally are not restricted. Payments for most other invisibles require prior approval and are restricted. Applications for foreign exchange for busi- ness travel, medical treatment, and education abroad are considered on an individual basis. As a rule, for business travel exporters with export earnings of Tk 5 million or ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution more during the preceding year are entitled to a max- imum of US$10,000 a year. Exporters with export earnings of Tk 2.5 million to Tk 5 million in the preceding year are entitled to a quota equivalent to 1 percent of the f .o .b. value of their exports, subject to a minimum of US$4,000 and a maximum of US$10,000. Those with export earnings of less than Tk 2.5 million (i.e., newcomers) during the preceding year are allowed 1 percent of the f .o .b. value of exports, subject to a maximum of US$4,000. New exporters are entitled to an allowance of US$80 a day for a maximum of 30 days a year. For medical treatment the amount granted is US$1,000 at the official rate, and additional actual requirements under the Wage Earners' Scheme, subject to the consent of the Bangladesh Bank. A Bangladesh national proceeding abroad by air is allowed to purchase foreign exchange from a Foreign Currency Account under the Wage Earners' Scheme, subject to certain limits (see section on Nonresident Accounts, above). Foreign nationals working in Bangladesh must obtain approval before making remittances abroad for family maintenance; such approval is usually granted for up to 50 percent of wages or salaries, subject to a maximum of £ stg. 200 a month (net of tax) for nationals of countries other than India, and up to Tk 1,500 for Indian nationals, if the terms of employment have been approved by the Government. Nonresident travelers may take out the foreign cur- rency and traveler's checks they declared on entry less the amount sold to authorized dealers or money chan- gers; they may also, without obtaining the approval of the Bangladesh Bank, reconvert taka notes up to Tk 6,000 into convertible foreign currencies at the time of their exit. Resident travelers may take out foreign currency and traveler's checks up to the amount of any travel allocation they have been granted. Bangladesh nationals may take out Tk 100 in domestic currency; otherwise, the export of Bangladesh currency notes and coin is prohibited. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Israel and South Africa and exports transported on the flag vessels of Taiwant are pro- hibited. The proceeds from exports must be received within four months of shipment. Exports of ju te and jute goods must be registered with the Bangladesh Bank. Proceeds from Invisibles All proceeds from invisibles must be surrendered, but Bangladesh nationals working abroad may retain their earnings in Foreign Currency Accounts or in Nonresi- dent Foreign Currency Deposit Accounts. Unless specifi- cally exempted by the Bangladesh Bank, all Bangladesh nationals who are resident in Bangladesh must surrender any foreign exchange coming into their possession, whether held in Bangladesh or abroad, to an authorized dealer within one month of the date of acquisition. tSee Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part two, page 75. BANGLADESH Foreign nationals residing in Bangladesh continuously for more than six months are required to surrender any foreign exchange representing their earnings in respect of business conducted in Bangladesh or services ren- dered while in Bangladesh, within one month of the date of acquisition. Foreign exchange held abroad or in Bangladesh by foreign diplomats and by foreign nation- als employed in embassies and missions of foreign countries in Bangladesh is, however, exempt from this requirement. The import of Bangladesh currency notes and coin exceeding Tk 100 is prohibited. Foreign currency traveler's checks and foreign currency notes may be brought in by nonresident travelers without limit, provided that the total amount brought in is declared to the customs authorities upon arrival. Foreign currency notes may be brought in without limit by any person, provided that the total amount brought in is declared upon arrival. No declaration is required for import of foreign exchange not exceeding US$1,000 by nonresi- dents or US$750 by residents. Capital All outward transfers of capital require approval; such approval is not normally granted in respect of resident- owned capital. Inward capital transfers also require approval. Movable and immovable assets, including foreign exchange, owned in any country other than Bangladesh have to be declared to the Bangladesh Bank by resident Bangladesh nationals. There is no restriction on the importation of securities into Bangladesh, but the transfer of securities in favor of a person resident outside Bangladesh requires approval. This requirement applies to all Bangladesh securities, whether held by residents or not, and to all foreign securities held by residents. Authorized dealers may obtain short-term loans and overdrafts from overseas branches and correspondents for a period not exceeding seven days at a time. Borrow- ing abroad by resident nonbank firms of Bangladesh origin requires approval. Borrowing by nonresident- owned or nonresident-controlled enterprises from com- mercial banks in Bangladesh beyond specified ceilings, as well as any borrowing from abroad, requires ap- proval, and loans by authorized dealers in local currency against overseas guarantees or collateral outside Bangla- desh also require approval. Authorized dealers may, however, approve loans, overdrafts, or credit facilities against goods intended for export from Bangladesh to companies controlled by persons resident outside Ban- gladesh. Authorized dealers must obtain approval before making any loans in foreign currencies to residents or nonresidents, whether secured or unsecured. They are not normally permitted to hold short-term foreign assets other than small working balances. The permission of the Bangladesh Bank is required for nonresidents other than banks to establish or continue a business in Bangladesh. Foreign private investment is governed by the Foreign Private Investment (Promotion and Protection) Act of 1980 and is permitted in collab- oration with both the Government and private entrepre- neurs. The Act provides, inter alia, for protection and 113 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BANGLADESH equitable treatment of foreign private investment, in- demnification, protection against expropriation and nationalization, and guarantee for repatriation of invest- ment. In the private sector, however, foreign partici- pation is limited to those industries where technical know-how is not locally available, where the technology involved is very complicated, or where capital outlay is high, and to industries that are either based on local raw materials or that are wholly export oriented. For a new investment, foreign investors generally are required to provide as equity capital the entire amount of the project's foreign exchange component. There is no ceiling on private investment, but any investments above Tk 100 million need special approval. Tax holidays are granted for periods of up to nine years, depending on location. All foreign investments require approval by the Investment Board. Dividends on foreign capital may be remitted freely after payment of taxes, except that 10 percent of the annual remittable profits must be held in Bangladesh by sterling tea companies until the total amount held is equal to 200 percent of paid-up capital. Gold The import and export of gold or silver in any form are prohibited without special permission, which is not normally granted. There are no restrictions on the internal sale, purchase, or possession of gold or silver ornaments (including coin) and jewelry, but there is a prohibition on the holding of gold and silver in all other forms except by licensed industrialists or dentists. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement The official exchange rate for the taka was adjusted on 14 different occasions during the year, from Tk 26 = US$1 at the end of 1984 to Tk 31 = US$1 at the end of 1985, involving a depreciation of 16.13 percent. July 1. The secondary exchange market again became a free interbank market, with the Bangladesh Bank no longer undertaking net sales in the market on a quarterly basis. In addition, under the newly established Export Performance Benefit Scheme (XPB), about 42 percent of all export receipts were made eligible for conversion at the secondary market exchange rate, and the conversion of receipts from exports of consulting and technical services was transferred to the secondary market. Prescription of Currency May 5.

A facility called the Education Foreign Currency Account (EFCA) was instituted, from which funds could be used to meet the educational expenses of resident immediate family members of nonresident Ban- gladesh nationals. Eligibility conditions and terms for the EFCA are similar to those of the other foreign currency accounts. November 18. A Barter Protocol was signed between Bangladesh and Bulgaria, to be in effect from Novem- ber 18, 1985 through December 31, 1986. Imports and Import Payments July 1. In a major modification of the import regime, the Import Order for 1985 introduced two lists of import items, namely the Negative List and the Restricted List. The former included some 200 items that were banned, either for social and religious reasons or because similar items were locally produced; and the latter included items importable only on specified conditions, relating mainly to quality and nature of end users. Items not on these two lists were made freely importable through the secondary market, provided that the importer had a valid import registration certificate. Imports at the official exchange rate continued to be subject to allocation on the basis of foreign exchange availability; cash allocations would be granted for importation, inter alia, of books, technology, certain spares and machinery, and special raw materials and equipment for certain export-oriented sectors. In addition, the Import Order stipulated that (i) imports under any financing arrangement other than tied credits would not be permitted unless existing facilities under barter arrangements had been fully utilized; and (ii) importation of some 26 items through the secondary market would be allowed only by regis- tered commercial importers. All importers were also to be issued with passbooks containing information on their business and service, as well as a record of restrictions or exemptions affecting their ability to import. Payments for Invisibles January 10. The maximum permissible amount of membership fees that could be remitted to foreign professional organizations under the Wage Earners' Scheme was raised from the equivalent of US$50 to US$100 a person a year. Exports and Export Proceeds March 12. Raw jute exporters who had fulfilled at least half their 1984/85 contract delivery commitments were allowed to apply for the new registration of export sales. July 1. Under the Export Policy Order for 1985/86, the XPL facility was eliminated and replaced with the Export Performance Benefit Scheme (XPB), under ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BANGLADESH which foreign exchange receipts from exports of some 45 (mainly nontraditional) items were made fully eligible for conversion at the secondary market. Proceeds from raw jute, loose tea, and wet blue leather would be converted at the official exchange rate; all other ex- port items received a "secondary market sale" coeffi- cient of either 70 percent or 40 percent, depending on domestic value added. The Export Policy Order autho- rized the drawback on duty paid in excess of 2.5 percent on a reasonable quantity of imports of spare parts by actual export-oriented industries; it further prohibited the export of wheat bran, extended the export ban on oil cakes, molasses, and de-oiled rice bran to June 30, 1986, and partially relaxed the ban on exports of maps and charts. December 1. The following changes were made in export regulations, resulting in an increase in the proportion of foreign exchange receipts eligible for conversion through the secondary foreign exchange market: (a) permissible secondary market sales of foreign exchange proceeds were increased from 70 per- cent to 100 percent for exports of twine and yarn, and from 40 percent to 70 percent for hessian and sacking; and (b) commission receipts by "indenters" (i.e., agents of foreign suppliers) were made eligible for conversion through the secondary market. 115 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BARBADOS (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Barbados is the Barbados Dollar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at BDS$2 = US$1. On December 31, 1985 the official buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were BDS$1.9975 and BDS$2.0350, respectively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates for the Canadian dollar, the deutsche mark, and the pound sterling are also officially quoted. These rates include commission charges of 0.1875 percent buying and 1.8125 percent selling. On December 31, 1985 the buy ing and selling rates of the Central Bank of Barbados for the Canadian dollar were BDS$1.4266 and BDS$1.4553, respec- tively, per Can$l; those for the deutsche mark were BDS$0.8100 and BDS$0.8263, respectively, per DM 1; and those for sterling were BDS$2.8731 and BDS$2.9307, respectively, per £ stg. 1. Under clearing arrangements with regional monetary authorities, the Central Bank sells currencies of the Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM) countries1 at fixed rates (including a commission of 0.125 percent) but purchases only East Caribbean and Trinidad and Tobago dollar notes. The rate applied mutually for the purchase of currency notes is the parity rate between each pair of currencies determined on the basis of the U .S. dollar rate. The Central Bank regulates the commission that may be charged by the commercial banks in dealings with their customers in CARICOM currencies. Purchases of foreign exchange for private sector remittances abroad (except for remittances for payment of imports, travel allowances, education, and nontrade payments up to BDS$500 and certain other specified items) are subject to a levy collected in the approval process by the Central Bank at the rate of 1 percent of the value of the transaction. Administration of Control Exchange control applies to all countries and is administered by the Central Bank. The Central Bank delegates to authorized dealers the authority to approve normal import payments and the allocation of foreign exchange for certain other current payments and for cash gifts. The exchange control system provides that foreign exchange should normally be surrendered to an autho- rized dealer. The normal exchange control directives do not apply to transactions between residents and persons resident in South Africa. Trade controls are administered by the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Consumer Affairs. 'The CARICOM countries are Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Chris- topher and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. 116 Prescription of Currency Settlements with residents of countries outside the CARICOM area other than South Africa may be made in any foreign currency, 2 or through an External Account in Barbados dollars. Settlements with residents of CARICOM countries must be made either through External Accounts (in Barbados dollars) or in the currency of the CARICOM country concerned, except that commercial banks may issue CARICOM traveler's checks denominated in Trinidad and Tobago dollars to Barbadian residents traveling to other CARICOM countries, within the ap- proved limits for travel allowances. Nonresident Accounts With the permission of the Central Bank, authorized dealers may maintain in foreign currencies Foreign Currency Accounts in the names of residents of Bar- bados and of other countries. Approval for opening these accounts is given on the basis of the anticipated frequency of receipts and payments in foreign currency. Certain receipts and payments may be credited and debited to Foreign Currency Accounts, under the condi- tions of approval established at the time the account was opened. Other credits and debits require individual approval. External Accounts may be opened for nonresidents by authorized dealers without reference to the Central Bank. These accounts are maintained in Barbados dollars. They may be credited with proceeds from the sale of foreign currencies, with transfers from other External Accounts, with bank interest (payable on External Accounts or Blocked Accounts), and with payments by residents for which general or specific permission has been given by the Central Bank. They may be debited for payments to residents of Barbados, for the cost of foreign exchange required for travel or business purposes, and for any other payments covered by delegated authority to autho- rized dealers. Other debits and any overdrafts require individual approval. The Exchange Control Act of 1967 (as amended) empowers the Central Bank to require certain payments in favor of nonresidents that are ineligible for transfer to be credited to Blocked Accounts. Balances in Blocked Accounts may not be w i thdrawn without approval, other than for the purchase of approved securities. Imports and Import Payments All imports from South Africa are prohibited, and certain imports originating in non-CARicoM countries require individual licenses. The use of import licensing requirements and quan t i ta t ive restrictions are the chief tools of Barbadian external commercial policy, since 2Foreign currencies comprise all currencies other than the Barbados dollar. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution tariff policy is pre-empted by the CARICOM. The list of products subject to licensing is extensive. However, not all goods that are subject to import licensing are subject to quantitative restriction. Some items on the import licensing list may be freely imported throughout the year, while some others are subject to temporary restriction (particularly agricultural products, which tend to be subject to seasonal restriction). Certain imports are prohibited; these include various foodstuffs, blue jeans, and beer not produced within the CARICOM area. There is also a "Negative List" for certain garments, the importa- tion of which is totally prohibited if the product is below a minimum c . i . f. value. Individual licenses are also required for imports of commodities that are subject to the provisions of the Oils and Fats Agreement between the Governments of Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago, whether the goods are being imported from CARICOM countries or from elsewhere. Special licensing arrangements have been made for the regulation of trade between Barbados and other CARICOM countries in 22 agricultural commodities. Payments for authorized imports are permitted upon application and submission of documentary evidence (invoices and customs warrants) to authorized dealers; payments for imports of crude oil and derivatives are subject to the prior approval of the Central Bank. Advance payments for imports require prior approval by the Central Bank. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles require exchange control approval. Except for transactions involving residents of South Africa, payments for all commercial transactions are permitted freely when the application is supported by appropriate documentary evidence. Authority has been delegated to authorized dealers to provide basic alloca- tions of foreign exchange for certain payments of a personal nature and for sundry payments. These include foreign travel (for which up to BDS$ 1,500 a person a calendar year may be allocated for private travel within or outside the CARICOM area; and BDS$200 a day, up to BDS$4,000 a person a calendar year, for business travel within the CARICOM area, and BDS$6,000 outside the CARICOM area), expenses of education abroad (BDS$5,000 a person a year), remittances of cash gifts not exceeding BDS$100 a donor a year, subscriptions to newspapers and magazines, income tax refunds, official payments, and life insurance premiums. Applications for additional amounts or for purposes for which there is no basic allocation are approved by the authorities, provided that no unauthorized transfer of capital appears to be involved. The cost of transportation to any destination may be settled in domestic currency and is not deducted from the travel allocation. Outward remit- tances of funds to overseas insurers or other pension fund administrators are subject to a tax of 6 percent. Residents traveling to any destination outside Bar- bados may take out foreign currency notes and coin up to BARBADOS the value of BDS$500 and Barbados notes up to BDS$200. Nonresident visitors are not permitted to take out any Barbados currency but may freely export any foreign currency they had previously brought in. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to South Africa are prohibited. Specific licenses are required for the export of certain goods to any country; these include rice, cane sugar, rum, molasses, and certain other food products, sewing machines, portland cement, and petroleum products. All other goods may be exported without license. The collection of export proceeds is supervised by the Central Bank to ensure that proceeds in foreign currencies are surrendered within six months from the date of ship- ment. Exports of sugar to the United Kingdom and the United States are subject to bilateral export quotas, as are exports of rum to the European Community. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign currency proceeds from invisibles must be sold to an authorized dealer. Travelers to Barbados may bring in freely notes and coins denominated in Barbados dollars or in any foreign currency. Residents are required to sell their holdings of foreign currencies to an autho- rized dealer upon return to Barbados. Capital All outward capital transfers, including direct invest- ments by residents and the purchase by residents of foreign currency securities and of real estate situated abroad, require exchange control approval. Certificates of title to foreign currency securities held by residents must be lodged with an authorized depository in Bar- bados, and earnings on these securities must be repatri- ated and surrendered to an authorized dealer. Personal capital transfers, such as inheritances due to nonresidents, require exchange control approval. Trans- fers in respect of inheritances are restricted to BDS$20,000 annua l ly for each nonresident beneficiary. Dowries in the form of settlements and cash gifts may be transferred to nonresidents w i th exchange control ap- proval, normally up to BDS$500 a donor a year. Emigrating Barbadian nationals are granted settling-in allowances from their declared assets at the rate of BDS$20,000 a fam i ly un it a year. The Central Bank also considers applications from foreign nationals who have resided in Barbados and are proceeding to take up permanent residence abroad, provided that they declare their assets held in Barbados. Direct investment by nonresidents may be made with exchange control approval. The remittance of earnings on, and liquidation proceeds from, such investment is permitted, subject to the submission of documentary evidence as to the validity of the remittance, the discharge of any liabilities related to the investment, and the registration of the original investment with the Central Bank. 117 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BARBADOS The issuance and transfer to nonresidents of securities registered in Barbados require exchange control ap- proval, which is freely given on condition that an adequate amount of foreign currency is brought in for their purchase. Proceeds from the realization of these securities may be remitted when it is established that the original investment was financed from foreign currency sources. Nonresidents may acquire real estate in Bar- bados for private purposes with funds from foreign currency sources; local currency financing is not ordinar- ily permitted. Proceeds from the realization of such investments equivalent to the amount of foreign currency brought in may be repatriated freely. Capital sums realized in excess of this amount may be repatriated freely on the basis of a calculated rate of return on the original foreign investment, as follows: for the last five years at 8 percent a year; for the five years immediately preceding the last five years at 5 percent; and for any period preceding the last ten years at 4 percent. Amounts in excess of the sum so derived are restricted to the remittance of BDS$24,000 a year. The approval of the Central Bank is required for residents to borrow abroad or for nonresidents to borrow in Barbados. Authorized dealers may assume short-term liability positions in foreign currencies for the financing of approved transfers in respect of both trade and nontrade transactions. They may also freely accept deposits from nonresidents. Any borrowing abroad by authorized dealers to finance their domestic operations requires the approval of the Central Bank. Gold Gold coins with face values of BDS$100, BDS$150, and BDS$200 are legal tender and are in limited circulation. Residents who are private persons are permitted to acquire and hold gold coins for numismatic purposes only. Otherwise, any gold acquired in Bar- bados must be surrendered to an authorized dealer unless exchange control approval is obtained for its retention. Residents other than the monetary authorities, authorized dealers, and industrial users are not permitted to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry or coins for numismatic purposes. Imports of gold by residents are permitted for industrial purposes and are subject to customs duties and charges. Licenses to import gold are issued by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Consumer Affairs; no license is required to export gold, but exchange control permission is required to do so. Changes During 1985 Imports and Import Payments January 7. Various types of unworked P .V .C. pipe were added to the list of items requiring import licenses. March 11.

Gold February 12. The Central Bank of Barbados issued a BDSS100 gold coin. October 14. The Central Bank of Barbados issued a BDS$500 gold coin to commemorate the visit to Bar- bados of Queen Elizabeth II. 118 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BELGIUM AND LUXEMBOURG (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Belgium is the Belgian Franc. The currency of Luxembourg is the Luxembourg Franc. Luxembourg is linked to Belgium in a monetary associa- tion within which the Luxembourg franc is at par with the Belgian franc. Belgium and Luxembourg participate with Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Ger- many, Ireland, Italy, and the Netherlands in the ex- change rate and intervention mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS). In accordance with this agree- ment, Belgium and Luxembourg maintain the spot exchange rates between their currencies and the curren- cies of the other participants within margins of 2.25 percent (in the case of the Italian lira, 6 percent) above or below the bilateral central rates. The agreement implies that the National Bank of Belgium stands ready to buy or sell the currencies of the other participating states in unlimited amounts at specified intervention rates. On December 31, 1985 these rates were as follows: Specified Intervention Rates Per: 100 Danish kroner 100 French francs 100 deutsche mark 1 Irish pound 100 Italian lire 100 Netherlands guilders Belgian Francs or Luxembourg Francs Upper limit Lower limit 564.1000 539.300 668.0000 638.600 2,048.3500 1,958.500 63.2810 60.4965 3.1305 2.7765 1,818.0000 1,738.0000 The participants in the EMS do not maintain the exchange rates for other currencies within fixed limits. However, in order to ensure a proper functioning of the system, they intervene in concert to smooth out fluctua- tions in exchange rates, the intervention currencies being each other's and the U .S. dollar. In Belgium-Luxembourg there are two spot exchange markets, the official (reglemente, or regulated) market and the free market. Most current transactions are settled in the official market; and only authorized banks may carry out exchange transactions permitted in that market. Most capital transactions take place in the free market. In a few cases, however, there is freedom of choice as to the exchange market in which conversion is to be effected. Authorized banks may sell on the official market currencies acquired on the free market. In the official market most convertible currencies are dealt.! However, although Zai'rian currency (the zai're) is 'Currencies dealt in the official market are Aus tra l ian dollars, Austrian sch i l l ings, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Irish pounds, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, South Afr ican rand, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U .S. dollars.

There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Nonbank residents may not acquire or surrender convertible currencies in the official spot market until a foreign payment is due. Nonbank residents may make forward purchases and sales of convertible currencies in the official market through authorized banks, provided that any foreign currency purchased is used for the authorized settlement of obligations within 15 working days from delivery (on the delivery date itself if the maturity of the forward contract is less than 15 days); exchange not used within that period must be resold in the official market. Profits resulting from forward con- tracts not used to cover authorized inward or outward payments through the official market must be surren- dered to the Treasury. On December 31, 1985 the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar in the official market were BF 50.25 and BF 50.47, respectively, per US$1. In the free exchange market, all currencies (including domestic and foreign bank notes) may be bought and sold at freely fluctuating rates. On December 31, 1985 the free market rates between banks for the U .S. dollar were BF 50.73 buying and BF 50.83 selling, per US$1. Any resident or nonresident, including banks, may deal in the free market. Forward transactions, whether by banks or nonbanks, are uncontrolled and do not require a permitted underlying transaction. There is normally no intervention in forward exchange in either exchange market. Belgium and Luxembourg formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from February 15, 1961. Exchange Control Territory There is no exchange control between Belgium and Luxembourg; the two countries constitute a single exchange control territory in relation to other countries. Banks in Luxembourg may not accept deposits in Luxembourg francs from nonresidents in Luxembourg or term deposits in excess of Lux F 1 million for 12 months or less from residents in Luxembourg. Administration of Control The ultimate responsibility for the administration of exchange control in the Belgian-Luxembourg Economic Union is exercised by the Belgo-Luxembourg Exchange Institute (IBLC). Exchange control powers for most payments and transfers are delegated to authorized banks. The Belgo-Luxembourg Administrative Commis- sion has authority to license trade transactions; it determines import and export policy, but has delegated the issuance of import and export licenses to the 119 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BELGIUM AND LUXEMBOURG licensing offices of the BLEU, one of which is located in each country. Bank supervision in Belgium is exercised by the Bank Commission, and in Luxembourg by the Luxembourg Monetary Institute. Prescription of Currency The prescription of currency requirements operate mainly to ensure that settlements with foreign countries are made through the appropriate exchange market or, where payments in Belgian or Luxembourg francs are involved, through the appropriate category of nonresi- dent account. Foreign countries are divided into two groups: the bilateral countries (comprising Burund i, Rwanda, and Zaire, although the BLEU is not a party to any bilateral payments agreement) and the convertible area (all other countries). All inward and outward transactions are classified in four groups, which may be summarized as follows: List A covers merchandise, transport expenses, industrial expenses (e.g., costs of processing), and other commer- cial expenses, including insurance, administrative ex- penses of sales agencies, and sharing in administrative expenses of central offices by branches and affiliates. List B covers settlements of travel agencies, salaries, pensions, fees, subscriptions, taxes, and public adminis- tration payments. It also includes family support pay- ments by emigrant workers of foreign nationality. List C covers (1) income on securities, loans, etc., rents, and operating profits; and (2) repatriation of certain foreign long-term investments. List D covers gifts, life insurance payments, fam i ly maintenance payments, capital invest- ments, liquidation of long-term investments and trans- fers by emigrants of foreign nationality, dealings in gold, transfers by emigrants of Belgian or Luxembourg nation- ality, transfers by immigrants, inheritances, forward covering of merchandise, private travel expenses (except when settled through travel agencies), and all transac- tions not in any of the other three lists. The permissible methods of settlement for foreign payments are as summarized in the table below. In addition to the general methods of settlement described above, individual licenses are granted in order to allow transfers through the official market for some of the transactions mentioned in List D. These cover essentially direct investment by enterprises and some capital transfers by ind iv idua ls. Conversely, imports and exports of diamonds, including related costs, may only be paid for in foreign currencies through the free market, or in Belgian or Luxembourg francs by means of nonresident Financial Accounts, or in domestic or S UMM A RY OF PERM ISS IBLE METHODS OF SETTLEMENT FOR FOREIGN PAYMENTS TRANSACT ION LIST COUNTRY GROUP FOREIGN CURR ENCY EXCHANGE MARKET NONRES IDENT ACCOUNT IN FRANCS A ,B ~ C D A ,B ,C ,D A ,B ~ Conver t ib le ^ ., , Conver t ib le Conver t ib le B i la teral Outward Payments Convertible A Any Any — — Inward Payments O f f ic ial Official or _ Free Free Convertible Convertible _. . . or F inanc ial F inanc ial B i la tera l* Conver t ib le ^ ., , Conver t ib le Convertible Official Official or Free Convertible *B i la te ral A c count of the coun t ry concerned.

Payments for goods of Egyptian origin (other than rice, raw cotton, and crude petroleum) are subject to special rules. Nonresident Accounts Belgian or Luxembourg franc accounts of nonresi- dents are classified as follows: 1. Convertible Accounts. Balances on these accounts are equivalent to currencies negotiated on the official market, and accounts may be opened freely in the name of any nonresident.2 They are not related to any country or monetary area. They may be used freely for set- tlements with residents that either must or may be made through the official market and for retransfer abroad through the official market, and they may be credited freely with proceeds from the sale by a nonresident of convertible currencies in the official market to authorized banks in Belgium and Luxembourg. Balances on Con- vertible Accounts may be transferred freely to other Convertible Accounts or be converted into any currency in the official market. Advances on Convertible Ac- counts other than mail-credit advances are subject to authorization by the IBLC. A minimum debtor interest rate may be prescribed during certain periods for mail- credit advances in Convertible Accounts of banks, with the exception of those for developing countries. Convert- ible Accounts may be held in the form of sight accounts (demand deposits), prior notice accounts, and time deposits. 2. Financial Accounts. These accounts may be opened only for residents in convertible area countries.3 They may be used freely for settlements that either must or may be made through the free market and for retransfer abroad through the free market, and they may be credited with proceeds from the sale by a nonresident of gold or any currency in the free market. Domestic bank notes and proceeds from the sale in the free market of foreign bank notes, when deposited with authorized banks by foreign travelers in Belgium and Luxembourg or by persons residing abroad, may be credited to Financial Accounts. Transfers between Financial Ac- counts are free. Balances on these accounts may be used to purchase gold or any currency negotiated in the free market. 3. Bilateral Accounts. These accounts may be opened for residents of bilateral countries. They are used for settlements with bilateral countries and may be credited International organizations and foreign diplomatic representations established in the BLEU maintain Special Accounts, which are equivalent to Convertible Accounts but are not subject to the restrictions applicable to the latter. Foreign employees of these organizations and representations may maintain Special Convertible Accounts, which may be credited with their remuneration in Belgian francs, provided they agree in writing not to arbitrage between both exchange markets to cover their current expenses in the BLEU. 3Foreign diplomats, foreign nationals employed by diplomatic representations accredited in the BLEU and by specified international organizations situated in the BLEU, individuals residing in Burund i, Rwanda, or Zaire, and BLEU nationals residing abroad temporarily for professional reasons are authorized to maintain Assimilated Resident Accounts.

Balances on Bilat- eral Accounts may be transferred to other Bilateral Accounts related to the same country. Transfers may also be made freely between Bilateral Accounts related to Burundi, Rwanda, and Zaire. In practice, the authori- ties permit the conversion of balances on Bilateral Accounts of the central banks of these three countries into foreign currencies in the official market. Interest, charges, and commissions relating to any nonresident account must be credited or debited either to the account in question or to another of the same category. Imports and Import Payments Individual licenses are required for (1) all imports from Albania, Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, the U .S .S .R ., and Viet Nam ,4 and (2) a number of imports from all other countries outside the BLEU.5 The com- modities for which individual licenses are required include many textile and steel products, certain agricul- tural products and foodstuffs, coal and petroleum prod- ucts, diamonds, and weapons. All other commodities are free of license; the sole requirement is a form completed by the importer giving notification of the payment (payment declaration—model A), which must be pre- sented to an authorized bank. No exchange control documentation is required for imports not exceeding BF 100,000 in value. Many commodities subject to individual licensing are also admitted without quantita- tive restriction. Along with other EC countries, the BLEU applies quotas on a number of textile products from non-EC countries; the BLEU also applies a system of minimum import prices to foreign steel products. Imports from non-EC countries of most products covered by the Common Agricultural Policy of the EC are subject to import levies, which have replaced all previous barriers to imports; common EC regulations are also applied to imports from non-EC countries of most other agricultural and livestock products. An authorized bank is required to make certain that payment is made by one of the methods laid down in the regulations (see section on Prescription of Currency, above) and that foreign exchange is not acquired until the import payment is due. Exchange control approval is required for payments for imports more than three months before or six months after the date of customs clearance; prior examination of supporting documents by the IBLC is required for payments exceeding BF 25 million and for payments made more than 30 days 4Import licenses are issued freely for a large number of commodities when originating in and shipped from Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the U .S .S .R. 5Most imports in the latter group do not require an import license when imported from the Netherlands or from other EC countries. 121 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BELGIUM AND LUXEMBOURG before the date of customs clearance. However, in the latter case, prior examination is not required if payment takes place either under a documentary credit or on a documentary collection basis, provided that documents are submitted to the authorized bank showing that the goods have already been shipped to the BLEU. Pay- ments for transit transactions must be made not later than three months from the date of any advance payment collected from the foreign buyer, and may not be made earlier than three months before the date on which such payment is expected to be received. Payments for Invisibles Payments to convertible area countries for transactions included in Lists A and B must be made through the official exchange market or by crediting Belgian or Luxembourg francs to a Convertible Account. For payments exceeding BF 25 million and in other excep- tional cases, prior examination of supporting documents by the IBLC is required. Payments to convertible area countries for items in List C may be made through either the official market (alternatively, by crediting Belgian or Luxembourg francs to a Convertible Account) or the free market (alternatively, by crediting Belgian or Luxem- bourg francs to a Financial Account, or in foreign or domestic bank notes); payments for items in List D must be made through the free market (alternatively, by crediting Belgian or Luxembourg francs to a Financial Account, or in foreign or domestic bank notes); pay- ments to bilateral countries must be made by crediting Belgian or Luxembourg francs to a Bilateral Account related to the country concerned; payments to Zaire, however, may also be made in zaires through a convert- ible account in Zaire. Foreign and domestic bank notes may be exported freely. Exports and Export Proceeds Individual licenses are required for exports of specified commodities to all countries outside the BLEU, such as weapons, strategic products, and agricultural products. Individual licenses are also required for steel products exported to the United States.^ All other exports are free of license; only a form (notice of export—model B) completed by the exporter and giving notification of the export must be presented to an authorized bank. Exchange control documentation is not required for exports of less than BF 100,000 in value. The authorized bank is required to verify that export proceeds are received in accordance with the regulations (see section on Prescription of Currency, above). Special authoriza- tion is required to collect export proceeds more than six months after the date of exportation. Export proceeds in convertible currencies must be surrendered to an autho- rized bank (i.e., sold in the official exchange market) within eight days of receipt or, alternatively, they may 6Most exports do not require an export license when exported to the Netherlands or to other EC countries. 122 be deposited in a Regulated Resident Account in Foreign Currency with an authorized bank if they are to be used later for current payments authorized to be made in these currencies. A holder of a Regulated Account is required to use holdings in these accounts by priority whenever an authorized payment through the official exchange market is made. The IBLC may order the holder to sell part or all of the holdings in the official exchange market, to abstain temporarily from making new deposits, and to surrender to the Treasury all gains from exchange rate appreciation. Advance collection of export proceeds more than three months before the expected date of exportation requires prior authorization by the IBLC. Proceeds from transit transactions must be collected within three months from the date of payment to the foreign supplier. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts in convertible currencies from invisibles connected with commercial transactions (Lists A and B—see section on Prescription of Currency, above) must be surrendered ( i .e ., sold in the official exchange market) within eight days of receipt or, alternatively, be credited to a Regulated Resident Account in Foreign Currency with an authorized bank if they are to be used later for authorized current payments. A holder of a Regulated Account is retired to use holdings in these accounts by priority whenever an authorized payment through the official exchange market is made. The IBLC may order the holder to sell part or all of the holdings in the official market, to abstain temporarily from making new deposits, and to surrender to the Treasury all gains from exchange rate appreciation. Receipts in convertible currencies from transactions included in List C may be retained or sold in the official or the free market. Receipts from other transactions (List D) and receipts in all other currencies may be retained or sold in the free market. Proceeds from transactions included in Lists C and D may also be collected in domestic or foreign bank notes. Foreign and domestic bank notes may be imported freely. Capital All capital transactions with convertible area countries may be carried out through the free market, by set- tlement in Belgian or Luxembourg francs through the Financial Account of a nonresident, or in domestic or foreign bank notes. Direct investments by enterprises and some capital transfers by individuals, including gifts, family maintenance payments, remittances by emigrants of Belgian or Luxembourg nationality, and inheritances, may also be made through the official market, subject to individual license. The exchange control authorities may guarantee the repatriation of approved foreign investments made in Belgium and Luxembourg. In that case, capital brought in through the official market (under special license and as an exception to the standard prescription of currency set out above) may be repatriated through that market. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Also eligible for outward transfer through the official market are the amortization and redemption proceeds of bonds denominated in Belgian or Luxembourg francs, quoted on a stock exchange in the BLEU, and owned by residents of convertible area countries, provided that such securities have been held at least 18 months prior to the maturity date. All transactions in securities by residents or nonresidents are free, but the financial settlement of such transactions must conform to the general regulations for capital transactions. The prior approval of the Ministry of Finance is required for issues of securities on the Belgian capital market by nonresi- dents; most of the Belgian franc bond issues on the domestic capital market have, in practice, been made by international organizations, while issues of Euro- bonds denominated in Belgian francs are not normally permitted. The Luxembourg Monetary Institute (LMI) regulates the issue of franc-denominated bonds on the Luxem- bourg capital market: for public bond issues, an official calendar is established and priority is given to domestic public sector borrowing and to enterprises utilizing the funds for domestic investment; for private bond issues, no official calendar exists, but the LMI monitors the overall volume and frequency of issues. Public bids by foreign companies or individuals for the purchase or exchange of shares issued byj Belgian companies require the prior approval of the Ministry of Finance. Outward payments for capital transactions w i th bilateral countries may be made only in Belgian or Luxembourg francs through Bilateral Accounts or, in the case of Zaire, in zai'res; inward payments for capital transactions w i th bilateral countries may be made in Belgian or Luxem- bourg francs through Bilateral Accounts, in any currency through the free market or, in the case of Zaire, in zai'res. BELGIUM AND LUXEMBOURG Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in coins or bars, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in these forms by residents and nonresidents are unrestricted and free of license; settlements in respect of gold transactions in coins or bars with convertible area countries may be made only through the free market, through Financial Accounts in Belgian or Luxembourg francs, or in domestic or foreign bank notes. Imports and transactions in monetary gold are subject to a value- added tax in Belgium at a rate of 1 percent. Licenses are required for imports of semiprocessed gold. Imports of gold for industrial, artistic, or medical use may be paid through the official market. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement July 22.

The Central Bank quotes daily rates for the pound sterling, the Canadian dollar, and a number of currencies of member countries of the CARICOM. l A stamp duty of 1.25 percent is levied on all conversions from the Belize dollar to foreign currency. Belize acccepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund Agreement on June 14, 1983. Administration of Control The Central Bank is responsible for the administration of exchange control, which is applicable to all countries. Authority covering a wide range of operations is dele- gated to the commercial banks in their capacity as authorized dealers. Only in exceptional cases or in applications involving substantial amounts is reference made directly to the Central Bank. However, all applica- tions for foreign exchange processed by authorized dealers are regularly forwarded to the Central Bank for audit and record keeping. Trade controls are adminis- tered by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Prescription of Currency The only prescription of currency requirement relates to a specified list of currencies2 in which authorized intermediaries are permitted to deal with the public. Payments to a CARICOM member country must be made in the currency of that country. Nonresident Accounts Permission of the Central Bank is needed for banks to open external or foreign currency accounts. The Central Bank may direct also that sums to be credited or paid to foreign residents be credited to a blocked account. Imports and Import Payments Payments for imports require authorization by the Central Bank; in most cases such authorization is delegated to the commercial banks. For reasons of 'The CARICOM countries are Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Christopher and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. 2Canadian dollars, pounds sterling, U .S. dollars, and the currencies of the member countries of the CARICOM. 124 health, standardization, and protection of domestic in- dustries, import licenses from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry are required for a number of goods, mostly food and agricultural products, and certain household and construction products; such licenses are liberally administered. There are no quota limits nor other quantitative restrictions for balance of payments reasons. Goods imported into the country are subject to import duties, ad valorem, in many cases, and specific, in others. Imports by most of the public sector and certain nonprofit entities, imports of an emergency or humani- tarian nature, and goods for re-export are exempt from import duties; goods originating from the CARICOM area are also exempt. All imports are subject to a stamp duty of 10 percent of the c . i . f. value. Payments for Invisibles There are no restrictions on payments for invisibles. Authorized dealers have the power to provide foreign exchange for such payments below certain limits. The following limits are applied to purchases of foreign exchange: (a) nonbusiness travel by residents, up to BZ$ 1,500 a person a calendar year; (b) business travel by residents, BZ$200 a day a person, up to BZ$6,000 a year; (c) business or nonbusiness travel by nonresidents, BZ$500 a person a year, except where payment is made from an external account or from proceeds of foreign currency; (d) educational allowance, BZ$500 a course a year (apart from a once-only allowance of BZ$ 1,000 for educational expenses and maintenance); and (e) gifts, BZ$100 a donor. Requests in excess of these amounts are referred to the Central Bank; all bona fide requests are granted. Exports of foreign and domestic bank notes and currency are subject to limits as follows: each traveler may carry domestic bank notes up to BZ$100 and the equivalent of BZ$400 in foreign currency, except that a visitor may take out such notes up to the amount imported. Amounts beyond these limits require approval of the Central Bank, which is liberally granted when jus t if ied. Exports and Export Proceeds Export licenses are required for most of the export products. Export proceeds must be surrendered to autho- rized dealers not later than six months after the date of shipment, unless determined otherwise by the Central Bank. A small number of items3 are subject to an ad valorem export duty of 5 percent. Re-exports and transshipments are subject to a 3 percent customs admin- istration fee. 3Lobster, shrimp, conch, fish, turtles, mahogany, and wild animals. For sugar, the export du ty is 2 percent. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BELIZE Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign currency proceeds from invisibles must be sold to an authorized dealer. Travelers to Belize are free to bring in notes and coins denominated in Belize dollars up to BZ$100 a person, but there are no restrictions on imports of foreign currency. Resident travelers are required to sell their excess holdings of foreign curren- cies to an authorized dealer upon return to Belize. Capital All capital transfers require approval of the Central Bank but control is liberally administered. Gold Residents may not hold gold except by specific authorization from the Central Bank. Gold may neither be imported nor exported without the approval of the Central Bank. Changes During 1985 Imports and Import Payments March 30. The stamp du ty rate on imports was increased from 8 percent to 10 percent, and the customs administration fee on entrepot trade was raised from 2 percent to 3 percent. 125 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BENIN (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Benin is the CFA Franc,1 which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. The official buying and selling rates are CFAF 50 = F 1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market and the fixed rate between the French franc and the CFA franc. They include a bank commission. The BCEAO levies a commission of 0.10 per mill for transfers from countries outside the West African Monetary Union and one of 2.50 per mill for transfers to such countries.2 Banks levy a commission on transfers to all countries outside the West African Monetary Union, part of which must be surrendered to the Treasury. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of those relating to gold and the repatriation of export proceeds, Benin's exchange con- trol measures do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Cote d'lvoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign coun- tries bu t, for purposes of certain controls relating to the repatriation of export proceeds and to capital flows, the countries specified in this paragraph are also regarded as foreign countries. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Directorate of Currency and Credit in the Ministry of Finance, in conjunction with the Directorate of External Commerce in the Ministry of Commerce. The Ministry of Finance, however, has the main responsibility for drawing up the exchange control regulations, in collaboration with the BCEAO. The BCEAO is authorized to collect, either directly or through banks, financial institutions, the Postal Administration, and notaries public, any informa- tion necessary to compile balance of payments statistics. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be carried out by authorized intermediaries. Import licenses are issued by the Directorate of External Commerce. Exports of diamonds and other precious or semiprecious materials require prior approval in the form of a decree issued by the Council of Ministers. "The CFA franc is issued by the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de 1'Quest (BCEAO) and is the common currency in Ben in, Burkina Faso, Cote d'lvoire, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo. 2Transfers between member countries of the Union are subject to a flat commission of CFAF 100 levied on settlements between agencies of the BCEAO. 126 Prescription of Currency Since Benin is linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account, settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and other countries linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other Operations Account country. Current pay- ments to or from The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea- Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are normally made through the West African Clearing House. Settlements with all other countries are usually effected through correspondent banks in France, in any of the currencies of those countries, or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. Certain settlements with the People's Republic of China and specified socialist countries, however, are made through special accounts.3 All settlements with South Africa are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. The crediting to nonresident accounts of CFA bank notes, French bank notes, or bank notes issued by any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury is not permitted, except for BCEAO bank notes mailed direct to the BCEAO agency in Cotonou by an authorized bank's foreign correspondent for credit to a Foreign Account in Francs opened by the latter with an authorized bank. Foreign Accounts in Francs may be debited, without prior authorization, with the value of BCEAO bank notes mailed by authorized intermediaries direct to their foreign correspondents. Imports and Import Payments All imports originating in or proceeding from South Africa are prohibited. Certain imports, such as narcotics, are prohibited from all sources. The Societe de 1'Alimen- tation Generate du Benin (AGB) has a monopoly over the importation of sugar, rice, wheat, wheat flour, condensed m i lk, alcoholic beverages, and tobacco. Certain other agencies have an import monopoly for other specified commodities. Imports of all other goods originating in countries in the French Franc Area may be made freely without an import license. Imports of all other goods originating in EC countries other than France may also be made freely; these goods require a license, which is issued automatically. Certain imports are liberalized when originating in member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Devel- opment (OECD) other than Japan and require only an import certificate made out by the importer himself. 3There is an inoperative payments agreement w i th Hungary. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Imports of nonliberalized commodities originating in OECD countries, all imports originating in Japan, and all imports originating in non-OECD countries are subject to licensing; they are admitted in accordance with an annual import program. Under this program, a global quota is established for imports from all countries outside the French Franc Area except EC countries. Certain French textiles processed in foreign countries are licensed separately. All imports originating in foreign countries, when valued at more than CFAF 500,000, must be domiciled with an authorized bank. The import licenses or import certificates entitle importers to purchase the necessary exchange, but not earlier than eight days before shipment if a documentary credit is opened, or on the due date of payment if the commodities have already been imported. Payments for Invisibles Payments to South Africa are prohibited. Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and countries linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to the approval of the Directorate of External Commerce, but for many types of invisibles the approval authority has been delegated to authorized banks. Authorized banks and the Postal Administration have been empowered to make payments abroad freely on behalf of residents, up to CFAF 50,000 a transfer. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been ap- proved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted. For tourist travel, residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the countries linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account may obtain an exchange allocation of an amount equivalent to CFAF 175,000 a trip for each person (CFAF 87,500 for children under ten) for any number of trips a year; any foreign exchange in excess of the equivalent of CFAF 5,000 remaining after return to Benin must be surrendered. For business travel, there is a special allocation of the equivalent of CFAF 20,000 a day, subject to a maximum of CFAF 400,000 a trip. The transfer of the entire net salary of a foreigner working in Benin is permitted upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher, provided that the transfer takes place within three months of the pay period. Travelers to foreign countries may take out up to a maximum of CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, and bank notes issued by other countries linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account. Residents traveling to countries of the French Franc Area may take out any amount in BCEAO bank notes, but if proceeding to a country that is not a member of the West African Monetary Union, they must declare to customs the amount taken out if it exceeds CFAF 150,000. Nonresident travelers may take out any unutilized foreign bank notes and coin up to the amount declared by BENIN them on entry, subject to adjustment for amounts exchanged for CFA francs or obtained by exchange of foreign currency. Nonresident travelers may take out freely the equivalent of CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, or bank notes issued by the countries linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account; a maximum amount equivalent to CFAF 25,000 in foreign bank notes; and any amount in other foreign means of payment (traveler's checks, etc.) established abroad and in their name. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. Exports to all foreign countries, including the French Franc Area, must be domiciled with an authorized bank when valued at more than CFAF 500,000. All exports, except gold and diamonds, are free of license but require an export application visaed by the Directorate of External Com- merce. The due date of payment for exports to foreign countries may not be later than 180 days after the arrival of the commodities at their destination; the foreign exchange thus received must be sold to an authorized bank within 30 days of payment due date, and its proceeds must be repatriated (as defined) by the latter by transfer via the BCEAO. Irrespective of currency of payment, prior authorization is required for the reten- tion, sale, import, or export of raw diamonds and of precious and semiprecious materials. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and countries maintaining Operations Accounts with the French Treasury may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be collected and surrendered. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BCEAO, the Bank of France, or a bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) of countries outside the French Franc Area; residents bringing in foreign bank notes and foreign currency traveler's checks in excess of CFAF 5,000 must declare them to customs upon entry and sell them to an authorized bank within eight days. Capital Transfers of capital between Benin and South Africa are prohibited. Capital movements between Benin and France (as defined above), Monaco, and countries linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account are free of exchange control; most capital transfers to all other countries require prior approval by the Ministry of Finance and are restricted, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. Special controls (additional to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable) are maintained 127 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BENIN over borrowing abroad, over inward foreign direct investment and all outward investment in foreign coun- tries, and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Benin. Such operations require prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. Exempt from authorization, however, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Beninese Government and (2) shares that are similar to or may be substituted for securities whose issuance or sale in Benin has already been authorized. With the exception of controls over foreign securities, these measures do not apply to France (as defined above), Monaco, member countries of the West African Mone- tary Union, and the countries linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account. Special con- trols are maintained also over imports and exports of gold, over the soliciting of funds for deposit or invest- ment with foreign private persons and foreign firms and institutions, and over publicity aimed at placing funds abroad or at subscribing to real estate and building operations abroad; these special controls also apply to France (as defined above), Monaco, and countries maintaining Operations Accounts. All investments abroad by residents of Benin re- quire prior authorization by the Minister of Finance; at least 75 percent of such investments must be financed from foreign borrowing.4 Foreign direct investments in Benin5 must be declared to the Minister before they are made. The Minister may request the postponement of the operations, within a period of two months. The full or partial liquidation of either type of investment also requires declaration. Both the making and the liquidation of investments, whether these are Beninese investments abroad or foreign investments in Benin, must be reported to the Minister and to the BCEAO within 20 days following each operation. Direct investments are defined as investments implying control of a company or enterprise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. Borrowing by residents from nonresidents requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans constituting a direct investment, which are subject to prior declaration, as indicated above; (2) loans taken up by industrial firms to finance operations abroad, by international merchanting and export-import firms (approved by the Minister of Finance) to finance transit trade, or by any type of firm to finance imports and exports; (3) loans contracted by authorized banks; and (4) subject to certain conditions, loans other than those mentioned above, when the total amount outstanding of these loans, including the new borrowing, does not exceed CFAF 50 million for any one borrower. The Including those made through foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in Benin and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Benin. 5Including those made by companies in Benin that are directly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in Benin of foreign companies. 128 repayment of loans not constituting a direct investment requires the special authorization of the Minister of Finance if the loan itself was subject to such approval, but is exempt if the loan was exempt from special authorization. Lending abroad is subject to prior authori- zation by the Minister of Finance. The Investment Code (Law No. 82-005 of May 20, 1982) provides for preferential status that may be granted to foreign and domestic investments in industry, mining, fisheries, agriculture, and tourism, when such invest- ments are deemed to be of value to national develop- ment. Four preferential regimes are established. Plan A is intended for public and mixed enterprises operating at the national and provincial levels and provides, during a period of up to five years, for exemption from import duties and taxes on materials necessary for the produc- tion of the proposed item and from certain other taxation. Plan B, for domestic and foreign private enterprises, is granted for a maximum exemption period of five years and provides, in addition to the benefits of Plan A, certain other tax privileges. Plan C is intended for very large enterprises wishing to conclude incorporation agreements with Benin, and is granted for a period of up to ten years. In addition to the benefits of Plan B, Plan C guarantees stability of tax status, free choice of sup- pliers, and certain other advantages. For Plans A, B, and C up to two years for installation time can be added to the period of the agreement. Plan D provides certain benefits for small and medium-sized domestic enter- prises and cooperatives for up to five years. The method of application of the Investment Code is set out in Decree No. 28-254 of July 13, 1983. Gold Prior authorization in the form of a decree issued by the Council of Ministers, acting on the advice of the Minister in Charge of Mines, is required to hold, sell, import, export, or deal in, raw diamonds and precious or semiprecious materials. In practice, residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Benin. Imports and exports of gold from or to any other country require prior authorization by the Minister of Commerce, which is seldom granted. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the Treasury or the BCEAO; (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles); and (3) imports and exports by travelers of gold articles up to a maximum weight to be determined by an Order of the Minister. Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Changes During 1985 Exports and Export Proceeds October 23. All claims on foreign countries or on a nonresident arising from merchandise exports were required to be sold to authorized intermediaries; the latter were also required to repatriate such funds to Benin by transfer through the BCEAO (Circular No. 2104 of the Ministry of Finance and Economy). ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BHUTAN (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Bhutan is the Ngu l trum. Since its introduction in 1974 it has been pegged to the Indian rupee, which also circulates in Bhu tan, at a rate of Nu 1 = Re 1. The rates for currencies other than the Indian rupee are determined daily on the basis of the prevailing quotations by the Reserve Bank of India for those currencies. In the absence of large transactions, exchange rates for other currencies may be determined on the basis of the most recent quotations by the Reserve Bank of India. No other exchange rates apply to international transactions, and there are no subsidies or taxes on exchange transactions. On December 31, 1985 the buying and selling rates of the ngultrum for the U.S. dollar were Nu 12.0700 and Nu 12.1654 per US$1, respectively. Administration of Control The Ministry of Finance controls external transactions and provides foreign exchange for most current and capital transactions. Beginning from July 26, 1985, substantial powers are delegated by the Ministry of Finance to the Royal Monetary Authority to release foreign exchange (other than Indian rupees) for current transactions. The Royal Monetary Authority is in charge of implementation of the surrender requirements for proceeds from merchandise exports. Prescription of Currency There are no regulations prescribing use of specific currencies in external receipts and payments. Imports and Import Payments All import payments other than those made in Indian rupees are subject to prior permission from the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry has discretionary authority to deny foreign exchange for the payment of luxury imports. Customs duties exist on imports other than those from India. Exports and Export Proceeds There are no export taxes or subsidies. Exports of antiques of Bhutanese origin are prohibited. Proceeds of exports in currencies other than the Indian rupee must be surrendered to the Royal Monetary Authority either directly or through the Bank of Bhutan. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Most invisible payments other than those made in Indian rupees are subject to approval by the Royal Monetary Authority. All receipts from invisible transac- tions in currencies other than the Indian rupee must be surrendered to the Royal Monetary Authority. Capital All capital transactions are subject to approval by the Ministry of Finance. Gold There are no specific regulations on transactions in gold. Changes During 1985 Administration of Control July 26. The Ministry of Finance delegated to the Royal Monetary Authority the power to release foreign exchange (other than Indian rupees) for the purpose of medical expenses, foreign travel, and other current payments. (The Royal Monetary Authority also during the year took a number of steps to ensure the surrender of foreign exchange receipts to the banking system.) 129 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BOLIVIA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Bolivia is the Bolivian Peso. The official buying rate is determined at an auction held daily by the Central Bank of Bolivia. On December 31, 1985 the exchange rate at the auction was $b 1,692,000 = US$1. The official exchange rate applies to all foreign exchange operations in Bolivia. The auctions are con- ducted by a Committee for Exchange and Reserves (Comite de Cambio y Reservas) in the Central Bank. Prior to each auction the committee decides on the amount of foreign exchange to be auctioned and a floor price, below which the Central Bank will not accept any bids. The Central Bank offers foreign exchange in minimum units of US$5,000; successful bidders are charged the exchange rate specified in their bid. The sale of foreign exchange to the public is free of all taxes and commissions. Except for the requirement to surrender the net proceeds from the export of goods and services, all banks, exchange houses, companies, and individuals can buy and sell foreign exchange freely. However, banks must maintain a balanced spot position in foreign exchange at all times and sell to the Central Bank any excess international reserves at the end of each day. All public sector institutions, including the public enterprises, must purchase foreign exchange for imports of goods and services through the Central Bank auction market. There is a parallel exchange market, at which the ex- change rate on December 31, 1985 was $b 1,850,000 = US$1 (selling). Bolivia formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from June 5, 1967. Administration of Control The Central Bank of Bolivia is in charge of operating the auction market for foreign exchange. It is also the enforcing agency for export surrender requirements as well as for other exchange control regulations. The Ministry of Finance, together with the Central Bank, is in charge of approving public sector purchases of foreign exchange for debt service payments. Prescription of Currency There are no prescription of currency requirements. Settlements are usually made in U.S. dollars or other convertible currencies. Payments between Bolivia and Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela must be made through accounts maintained with each other by the Central Bank of Bolivia and the central bank of the country concerned, within the framework of the multilat- eral clearing system of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA). 130 Imports and Import Payments All goods may be freely imported with the exception of sugar (temporarily subject to licensing requirements) and those controlled for reasons of public health or national security. Most private sector imports are subject to a tariff of 10 percent, plus 10 percent of the prevailing tariff rate. Most imports also are subject to a service levy of 2 percent. Merchandise imports in general are subject to a tax of 14 percent. Payments for Invisibles There are no restrictions on payments for invisibles. Public sector purchases of foreign exchange for debt service must be approved by the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank. Residents of Bolivian or foreign nationality must present a certificate of tax settlement (certificado de solvencia tributaria) when leaving the country. The fee for the certificate is $b 500 for air travel to neighboring countries, $b 250 for overland travel to such countries, $b 1,000 for air travel to other Latin American countries, and $b 1,500 for air travel to countries outside Latin America. Outward remittances of profit are governed by the provisions of Decision Nos. 24 and 80 of the Cartagena Agreement. Exports and Export Proceeds All goods may be freely exported. All proceeds from exports of the public and private sectors must be sold to the Central Bank at the official exchange rate within three days of receipt, with the exception of reasonable amounts deducted for foreign exchange expenditures undertaken to effect the export. As regards minerals, COMIBOL and the medium-sized mines export their own production, and the Mining Bank exports the production of the small private mines. All exports of goods and services must be effected through documentary letters of credit drawn on domestic banks. Proceeds from Invisibles Banks, exchange houses, hotels, and travel agencies are required to surrender during the first hour of the business day following the transaction, and at the buying rate established by the Central Bank, all their foreign exchange purchases from invisible transactions, includ- ing those from tourism. Capital Foreign exchange for outward capital transfers by residents or nonresidents can be purchased only from the banks or from the Central Bank. Inward capital transfers may be made freely, but government receipts of transfers and grants and all proceeds of borrowings from foreign public sector agencies must be surrendered to the Central ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Bank. All foreign credits, including suppliers' credits, to government agencies and autonomous entities and cred- its to the private sector with official guarantees are subject to prior authorization by the Ministry of Finance and to control by the Central Bank. All foreign borrow- ing by the private sector involving use of official foreign exchange for debt servicing requires prior approval by the Exchange Policy Board in cases of individual amounts not exceeding US$100,000, and by the Minis- try of Finance for larger amounts. Under Supreme Decree No. 19732 of August 11, 1983 financial institu- tions in Bolivia may make loans in the form of credits denominated in foreign currency for imports of capital goods and inputs for the external sector with resources from international financial institutions, foreign govern- ment agencies, or external lines of credit. Foreign investments in Bolivia, except those involv- ing petroleum and mining, are governed by the provi- sions of the Investment Law (Decree Law No. 18751) of December 14, 1981. The law is administered by the National Investment Institute. Investments in petroleum and mining are governed by the General Hydrocarbons Law and the Mining Code. Certain foreign investments are subject to Decision Nos. 24 and 103 of the Cartagena Agreement. Gold Imports and exports of gold and domestic trading in gold are regulated by the Central Bank. The Central Bank also purchases, for its use or for export in the form of gold bars, the total national production of gold. Without affecting these powers of the Central Bank, the Mining Bank may purchase at home and sell abroad, in unworked form, the output of gold, silver, and platinum. The Mining Bank also sells gold, silver, and platinum on the domestic market, subject to conditions that it establishes jointly with the Central Bank. The Central Bank is empowered to purchase its full requirements of gold from the Mining Bank. Cooperatives and other producers must sell the gold they produce to the Central Bank. The Mining Bank is authorized to sell a specified quantity of gold annually to domestic jewelers and dentists and is obliged to sell the remainder to the Central BOLIVIA Bank. Residents may freely purchase, retain, hold, and sell gold in any form other than bars. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement February 11. The official exchange rate of the Bolivian peso was adjusted from $b 8,571 = US$1 to $b 45,000 = US$1 (buying rates), representing a de- valuation of 80.95 percent. May 16. The official exchange rate of the Bolivian peso was adjusted from $b 45,000 per U .S. dollar to $b 67,000 (buying rates), representing a devaluation of 32.83 percent. August 29. In a major modification of the exchange arrangement, the official exchange rate began to be determined by means of an auction market, initially held twice a week (three times a week from November 1985, and five times a week from January 1986). The first auction established an official exchange rate of $b 1,150,000 = US$1, representing a devaluation of 94.17 percent. In addition, the spread of 11.9 percent between the buying and selling rates was discontinued. Separately, a 10 percent deposit requirement on pur- chases of foreign exchange, a 10 percent advance deposit by exporters, and a 10 percent exchange reimbursement certificate for sellers of foreign exchange were in- troduced. (All of these were, however, abolished in October and November 1985.) Imports and Import Payments August 29. Under Supreme Decree 21060, the system of import licensing and allocation of foreign exchange for imports was abolished, and it was announced that all goods other than those controlled on grounds of public health and national security could be freely imported. In addition, import tariff rates were lowered to 10 percent plus 10 percent of the previously prevailing tariff rate. October 20. Under Supreme Decree 21098, imports of sugar were temporarily made subject to import licensing for an undefined period. Invisibles August 29. Restrictions on the allocation of foreign exchange for invisible payments were abolished. 131 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BOTSWANA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement1 The currency of Botswana is the Botswana Pula, which is pegged to a basket of currencies consisting of a weight of 75 percent for the South African rand and of 25 percent for the SDR. On December 31, 1985 the official buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, were P 2.0943 and P 2.0996, respectively, per US$1; on the same date, the middle rate for the SDR was P 2.3079 per SDR 1. Exchange rates for certain other currencies2 are quoted on the basis of their rates against the U.S. dollar in international markets. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Exchange control is applicable to transactions with all countries. The Minister of Finance and Development Planning has delegated most of the administration of exchange controls to the Bank of Botswana (the central bank). The latter, in turn, has delegated certain powers to banks appointed as authorized dealers. Prescription of Currency Payments to or from residents of foreign countries must normally be made or received in a foreign currency or through a nonresident-held pula account in Botswana. There are no bilateral payments agreements. Imports and Import Payments Botswana is a member of a customs union with Lesotho, South Africa, and Swaziland, and there are generally no import restrictions on goods moving be- tween the four countries. Import permits are required, however, for most goods imported directly into Bots- wana from outside the customs union. Certain imported goods, including firearms, ammunition, fresh meat, and some agricultural and horticultural products, require permits regardless of the country of supply. There are no restrictions or delays on payments for authorized im- ports. Goods of domestic origin may move freely between Botswana, Malawi, and Zimbabwe by virtue of a customs agreement of 1956, provided they are not intended for re-export.

Again on February 11, 1986, the pula was revalued by 1 percent against the currency basket used for determining its exchange rate, resulting in a middle rate of P 1 = US$0.5526.

For a few items, such as precious and semi- precious stones, permits are required before export is allowed. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments to nonresidents for current transactions, while subject to control, are not restricted. Authority to approve a range of current payments within limits is delegated to commercial banks. The basic exchange allowance for tourist travel is the equivalent of P 5,000 a calendar year for an adult (P 2,000 for a child). The allowance for business travel is P 250 a day, up to a maximum of P 10,000 a calendar year. The annual limit on outward remittances by a temporary resident on contract is P 10,000 or 50 percent of eligible salary, whichever is greater; for a self-employed temporary resident, the limit is P 10,000. Separately, travelers may freely bring in any amount of domestic bank notes and coin and take out up to P 200 in such bank notes and coin. The Bank of Botswana may authorize the mainte- nance by residents of foreign currency accounts with banks abroad in proven cases of commercial need for such a facility. Capital Applications to make investments abroad are treated on their merits and in light of possible benefits to Botswana. Foreign inward investment in new or existing businesses is generally encouraged. Local borrowing by nonresident controlled companies is limited to initial facilities of up to P 100,000 without matching nonresi- dent capital; any additional local borrowing must be fully matched by use of nonresident funds. The acceptance of nonresident loans by any Botswana business is subject to the condition of nonrepayment of capital for two years from the receipt of such loans. Departing temporary residents are entitled to a basic remittable terminal allowance of up to P 10,000. Permanent residents are eligible for an emigration allowance of up to P 100,000. The balance of assets is normally permitted to be remitted in equal installments over three years from the date of departure. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement January 9. The pula was devalued by 15 percent against the currency basket used for determining its exchange rate, and the weight of the South African rand in the basket was increased from 50 percent to 75 per- cent, with an offsetting decline (to 25 percent) in the weight of the SDR.

BOTSWANA 133 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BRAZIL (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement1 The currency of Brazil is the Cruzeiro. Brazil follows a flexible exchange rate policy under which the exchange rate for the cruzeiro is adjusted on a daily basis in terms of its intervention currency, the U .S. dollar. Exchange transactions are carried out by the Central Bank of Brazil, the Banco do Brasil S .A ., and by banks and tourist agencies authorized to deal in foreign exchange; the tourist agencies deal only in bank notes and traveler's checks in a "manual market." Uniformity between the rates quoted by the monetary authorities and the effective rates of the authorized banks is ensured by the practice of the monetary authorities of standing ready to purchase exchange from the banks and to sell it to the banks at the official rate for approved transactions. On December 31, 1985 the buying and selling rates quoted by the monetary authorities to the public were Cr$l0,440 and Cr$10,490, respectively, per US$1. The same exchange rates are applicable to "agreement dollars" used for settlements with bilateral agreement countries. Rates for other currencies are based on the U .S. dollar rates in Brazil and the rates for the respective currencies in New York and Europe. With specified exceptions, foreign exchange transactions are subject to brokerage fees, calculated on a sliding scale, which result in effective rates of up to 3/i6 of 1 percent on either side of the rates set by the monetary authorities. A different effective rate arises on the selling side from the application of a financial transactions tax (imposto sobre operates de credito, cdmbio e seguro, e sobre operates relativas a titulos e valores mobiliarios) of 25 percent to purchases of foreign exchange for imports of goods and services, with specified exemp- tions. Another effective exchange rate arises from the application of a deposit requirement equivalent to 100 percent of the value of the exchange operation in respect of the contracting of exchange for the opening of letters of credit for certain imports (see below). Global daily limits are fixed for the authorized banks' bought and sold positions in foreign exchange. The limits are fixed in relation to the registered capital of each bank: a bank having registered capital of up to Cr$500 million may maintain a bought or sold position of up to US$750,000; over and above that financial base, a bank is allowed a bought position of US$1.5 million and a sold position of up to US$7.5 million. Banks that are authorized to operate exclusively in the manual market and tourist agencies are permitted to maintain a bought position of up to US$25,000 for each authorized branch, but may not maintain a sold position. The Central Bank supplies foreign exchange to authorized banks in amounts not exceeding those needed to elimi- ]On February 28, 1986 Brazil announced the replacement of the cruzeiro by a new currency, the cruzado, equal to 1,000 cruzeiros. At the same time, the exchange rate of the new currency was defined as Cr$13.77 = US$1, taking into account past inflation. 134 nate an oversold position, and limited to 100 percent of the exchange sold by the bank concerned to its customers during the same day or on the previous day; included in this limit is their manual market position (bank notes and traveler's checks). The banks are permitted to sell foreign exchange to each other, and transfers between branches of the same bank are allowed, subject to certain conditions; such transactions may be carried out either on a spot basis by cable or on a forward basis, and must be executed within 2 working days for spot transactions or not later than 180 days for forward transactions. b Administration of Control The National Monetary Council is responsible for the formulation of overall foreign exchange policy. In accordance with the guidelines established by the Coun- cil, exchange controls, regulations affecting foreign capital, and the management of international reserves are under the jurisdiction of the Central Bank. Limits on international borrowing by the public sector are applied by the Secretariat for Control of State-Owned Enter- prises (SEST) in the Planning Secretariat of the Presi- dency of the Republic. The National Council of Foreign Trade (CONCEX), a board headed by the Minister of Finance, formulates foreign trade policy. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is the Council's executive organ for dealing with foreign countries, while the Foreign Trade Department of the Banco do Brasil S.A. (CACEX) implements the Council's decisions within Brazil. CACEX issues export and import certificates (guias de exportagdo or declara^oes de exportagdo and guias de importagdo). Coffee exports are regulated by the Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC). The Customs Policy Commission (CPA), established within the Ministry of Finance, is responsible for formulating guidelines for tariff policy. The CPA also decides on changes in customs duties under the provisions of existing legislation. The import policy of the public sector is coordinated by the SEST. Prescription of Currency In principle, prescription of currency is related to the country of origin of imports or the country of final destination of exports, unless otherwise prescribed or authorized. Settlements with bilateral payments agree- ment countries2 are made in clearing dollars through the relevant agreement account. Payments between Brazil and Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, the Domini- can Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela must be made through accounts maintained 2Bilateral payments agreements are maintained with Bulgaria, the German Democratic Republic, and Poland. Bilateral accounts are also maintained with Hungary and Romania, but settlements are made in third country currencies every 90 days, and interest rates payable on balances are based on the international capital market. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution with each other by the Central Bank of Brazil and the other central banks concerned, within the framework of the multilateral clearing system of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA). Settlements with coun- tries with which Brazil has no payments agreements or special payments arrangements are made in U .S. dollars or other freely usable currencies. Imports and Import Payments The import of commodities originating in or shipped from Cuba is prohibited. CACEX has suspended the issuance of import licenses for a substantial number of imports for reasons of security, health, or morals; issuance of licenses is also suspended for a number of items for reasons of industrial policy. The importation of a small number of commodities is prohibited. There is also a limitation on the direct import of consumer goods (and on the purchase on the domestic market of any imported consumer goods) by the public and semipublic sector (direct organs of the Government, autonomous agencies, public enterprises, and companies with mixed public and private participation). All other imports may be grouped into the following two broad categories: (1) imports that are free of any requirement to secure prior administrative documenta- tion, including samples without commercial value and certain educational materials, and (2) imports that require an import certificate, which is issued auto- matically if it conforms to a previously submitted indicative annual import plan; revisions in the annual import plan are permitted automatically upon request for bona fide import payments. Import certificates are issued on an f .o .b. basis. CACEX is authorized to make a processing charge of up to 0.9 percent on the value of import certificates; as a rule, certificates are valid for 60 days, 90 days, or 180 days, depending on the commodity. For special bonded warehouse importers, CACEX establishes half-yearly foreign currency quotas and issues clearance certificates for certain groups of commodities. For a number of specified imports, the import certificate may be obtained after the commodity has been landed but before customs clearance. For most imports the prior approval of CACEX is required; these include goods imported by public bodies,3 imports for which tariff concessions are being sought, certain imports without exchange cover, goods for use in fairs and trade exhibitions, certain types of used capital goods, and goods to be brought in with foreign financing on a deferred payment basis. For the last-mentioned category, it is a prior condition for the granting of import certificates for most groups of commodities that importers must arrange external financing with specified minimum maturities in line with normal financing terms in international markets for the 3Under instructions issued by the Economic Development Council, federal ministries and subordinate agencies and public enterprises are required to submit, for approval by the President, an annual investment program incorporating their expected import requirements. In 1985 these imports were limited to US$2,000 million, excluding imports of wheat, oil, and oil products. BRAZIL type of commodity and the amount of financing in- volved.4 The specified terms are revised periodically by the Central Bank to ensure that they conform to prevailing conditions in international financial markets. Imports on a cash basis are not approved automatically, but CACEX grants exceptions from the specified financing terms for imports for projects aimed at import substitu- tion or export production, imports with payment terms equivalent to those provided by foreign governments and bilateral or multilateral agencies, and imports by small- or medium-sized firms. All importers must be registered with CACEX, and imports can be effected only by registered firms or persons. Importers are required to submit to CACEX an annual indicative import program as a basis for requesting import licenses; this program is revised automatically upon request for bona fide import payments. The Minister of Finance may, on a temporary basis, and in accordance with the directives of the Economic Development Council (EDC) and without prejudice to commitments under LAIA, authorize CACEX to reject applications for import certificates where: (1) imports are for speculative stockbuilding purposes; (2) imports are causing or are threatening to cause serious damage to the national economy for reasons other than those related to the balance of payments; or (3) imports originate in or are shipped from countries that impede Brazilian exports. Goods imported into the Manaus free zone are subject to an annual quota. The transfer to other parts of Brazil (as a passenger's baggage) of foreign goods originally imported into the Manaus free zone is restricted to the equivalent of US$600 free of import taxes. As a general rule, imports may be cleared through customs before an exchange contract is closed. How- ever, CACEX may approve applications for the payment of imports of any goods at terms of up to 360 days from the date of shipment, provided that no import duty concessions or other tax concessions are involved. External financing at terms in excess of 360 days for imports, regardless of the classification of the importer and the purpose of the merchandise, must be authorized by the Central Bank, which will evaluate them in the light of foreign debt policy. Payment of the amount financed, and the interest thereon, may be made only upon presentation of a certificate of authorization and the related scheme of payments issued by the Department of Foreign Capital Supervision and Registration (FlRCE). Prior to shipment of the goods, total payments to suppliers for the nonfinanced amount may not exceed 10 percent of the import value. Spot exchange contracts may be closed if the contract is intended to settle drafts, at sight or on maturity, and the appropriate shipping documents are presented. Spot exchange contracts must be settled on maturity of the draft; settlement may take place two working days in advance of the maturity date. Forward contracts, for up to 360 days, may be closed when a letter of credit is 4Certain specified imports, inc lud ing direct imports by public administrative bodies, are exempt from th is requirement. 135 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BRAZIL being opened. A noninterest-bearing deposit requirement equivalent to 100 percent of the value of the exchange operation is applied, with some exceptions,5 to the contracting of exchange for the opening of letters of credit. Such deposits must be transferred to the Central Bank as of the working day following the contracting of the exchange operation and are released on the date of settlement or the date of cancellation of the contract. Letters of credit must be opened within five working days from the date of the exchange contract. Letters of credit for more than 360 days may be opened without prior closing of an exchange contract. Commercial banks ordinarily require a guarantee deposit for their own protection for forward exchange contracts; the amount of the deposit varies with the credit standing of the customer. When the contracts are liquidated, guarantee deposits may be used in payment for the foreign exchange. Special procedures are applica- ble to certain imports of petroleum and petroleum products and of wheat. For petroleum and specified petroleum by-products, PETROBRAS concludes for each import transaction an individual foreign exchange contract. For some commodities, eligibility for exemption from import duties may be precluded by the existence of satisfactory domestic equivalents (similares with exchange and trade regulations. Some exports are free of controls, but exports of many commodities require prior approval of CACEX, while exports of specified commodities, including certain primary prod- ucts and raw materials required for domestic consump- tion, are prohibited or suspended, and exports of certain other commodities are conditional on prior domestic sales. Exports requiring approval include those effected through bilateral accounts, exports without exchange cover, exports on consignment, re-exports, commodities for which minimum export prices are fixed by CACEX, and exports requiring prior authorization by government agencies. Exports of certain commodities are subject to an annual quota. Exports of coffee are subject to authorization by the IBC, the Brazilian Coffee Institute. The IBC does not grant an authorization to export coffee unless the sales contract is based on a price that is at least equal to the m in imum registration price (in U.S. dollars a pound, f .o .b .) fixed periodically by the IBC for the various types of coffee, although discounts are also authorized. During 1985, the IBC continued to make periodic announcements of minimum registration prices for exports of soluble coffee and green, ground- roasted, and decaffeinated coffee, although not necessar- ily changing them. The foreign exchange proceeds from all exports are sold at freely negotiated rates within the limits of the official market. Foreign exchange contracts covering such transactions may be closed either prior to the shipment of goods or within ten working days after shipment. The export of hides of wild animals in any form is suspended. A number of export incentives are in operation, principally for manufactured commodities. Certain ex- porters of manufactured goods are eligible for a tax credit on indirect federal and state value-added taxes according to the terms of contracts signed prior to Ju ly 1982 under the Special Program of Tax Benefits for Exporters (BEFIEX). Firms signing new BEFIEX contracts are not eligible for the credits. However, for a number of exports to the United States (primarily textiles, leather- ware, footwear, and certain steel products), export taxes of 0.6-9.8 percent are levied. For exports of ladies' footwear to all destinations, a tax of 2.2 percent is levied. In 1985, export taxes at different rates were levied on a number of other products, irrespective of destination. Various financing programs for exporters, some at preferential rates of interest, are provided by the Banco do Brasil S .A. and the commercial banks. These financing facilities include both export financing and the financing of production and warehousing for export, particularly for manufactures. In addition, assistance is provided to exporters by way of export credit insurance and guarantees. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange proceeds from current invisibles must be sold through the Banco do Brasil S.A. or the authorized banks at the prevailing market rate. Traveler's checks and foreign bank notes are sold in the manual market. BRAZIL Brazilian enterprises rendering services to tourists (e.g., hotels, restaurants, travel agencies) may receive income tax rebates in proportion to their earnings from tourism, provided that the service is paid for in foreign exchange and that the tourist enterprise converts the exchange into cruzeiros at the official rate.6 Travelers may bring in domestic and foreign currency notes freely. Capital Capital inflows in the form of financial loans under National Monetary Council Resolution No. 63, as amended, or under the provision of the Foreign Invest- ment Law (Law No. 4131) are subject to ceilings and require the prior approval of the Central Bank. The prior approval of the Central Bank is required for borrowing by the private or public sector when the foreign funds originate from official financial institutions abroad, when the transaction is to be guaranteed by the National Treasury or, on its behalf, by any official credit institution, and for other foreign borrowing by the public and semipublic sector ( i .e ., direct organs of the Govern- ment, autonomous agencies, public enterprises, and companies with mixed public and private participation). Besides, prior approval by the Central Bank is required for borrowing by the private sector when the foreign funds originate from financial institutions abroad. Other- wise, inward transfers are unrestricted and free of control, although the subsequent utilization of the pro- ceeds for the acquisition of certain domestic assets may be subject to control. There is a separate regime for inward portfolio investment. For the purpose of repatria- tion and the remittance of income, however, inward transfers of foreign capital and the reinvestment of profits on foreign capital must be registered with FIRCE. Foreign capital is defined for this purpose as (1) goods, machinery, and equipment to be used to produce goods or to render services that have entered the country without an initial corresponding expenditure of foreign exchange; and (2) financial and monetary resources brought into the country for investment in economic pursuits, provided that, in either case, the owner is a person or firm resident or domiciled abroad or with headquarters abroad. Foreign capital other than capital invested in Brazilian securities is classified, for purposes of registration, as direct investments or loans, whether imported in the form of money or of goods, and it includes reinvested profits from foreign capital. Direct investment is defined as that foreign capital which constitutes part of the corporate capital and participates directly in the risk inherent in an economic undertaking. Foreign capital that is not part of the corporate capital of any enterprise is considered to be a loan. Any loan obtained to purchase capital goods abroad, whether contracted by the manu- facturer himself or by a third party, is considered to be financing (mostly suppliers' credit). 6Regulations to implement the relevant Decree-Law (No. 1587 of December 20, 1977) have not yet been introduced. 137 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BRAZIL Persons domiciled or resident abroad may make portfolio investments in Brazilian commercial and indus- trial securities only indirectly by acquiring shares in a Brazilian "investment company" quoted on Brazilian stock exchanges. Such capital is subject to registration with the Central Bank and must remain in the country for at least three months. The minimum participation in portfolio investment companies by foreign firms or individuals is US$1,000. Portfolio investments are ex- empted from the capital gains tax. For financial imports and for investments made in the form of goods, the registration is in the currency of the country of domicile of the creditor or investor (or of its head office) or, in special circumstances, in the currency of the country of origin of the goods or of the credit. To register loans that are made in foreign currency, it is necessary to certify that the interest rate corresponds to that prevailing in the original market of the loan, that the amortization schedule is not disproportionately heavy in the early stages of repayment, and, in the case of import financing loans, that the prices of the imported goods correspond to the prices of comparable goods in the country of origin. If the terms of financing are approved, CACEX examines the applications for some foreign borrowing in the light of the price of the proposed import. Capital entering Brazil is registered in foreign cur- rency. Reinvestments are defined as profits of companies established in Brazil and accruing to persons or compa- nies resident or domiciled abroad. Such profits must have been reinvested in the same companies that pro- duced them or in another sector of the Brazilian economy. The registration of reinvested profits is made simultaneously in Brazilian currency and in the currency of the country to which the profits could have been remitted. The conversion is calculated at the average exchange rate prevailing between the date on which the profits appeared on the balance sheet of a company and the date of their reinvestment. A progressive supplemen- tary income tax is levied on distribution of profits and dividends to nonresidents in excess of 12 percent of registered capital over a three-year period; the tax is applied whether or not the profits are remitted abroad, but reinvested earnings are exempt. Special regulations govern borrowing abroad. Under National Monetary Council Resolution No. 63, as amended, private commercial, investment, and devel- opment banks and the Banco Nacional de Desenvol- vimento Economico e Social (BNDES) may be autho- rized to take up foreign currency credits abroad for domestic relending for purposes of financing working capital. Safeguards against excessive use of such credits include limitations on the foreign obligations that each bank may assume (related to the terms of the credit and the size of the bank) and the provision that the ultimate borrower must agree to bear the exchange risk. The Central Bank assumes responsibility for the avail- ability of cover for the repatriation of the loan at maturity. All other financial loans in foreign currency 138 are effected under the general provisions of the Foreign Investment Law (Law No. 4131). Loans under this law also require prior central bank authorization, but the Central Bank does not undertake to provide specific exchange cover for them. Loans under Resolution No. 63, as well as those under Law No. 4131, must have a minimum term of nine years but no maximum term is set. Foreign loans are subject to mandatory deposit at the Central Bank. In the case of private enterprises, the deposit is applicable to 75 percent of the loan proceeds converted into cruzeiros and it is released as follows: one third after 60 days from the deposit date, another one third after 90 days, and the balance after 120 days; for public enterprises, the deposit is applicable to 100 percent of the loan proceeds converted into cruzeiros and is released as follows: 20 percent after 150 days from the deposit date, an additional fraction of 40 percent after 180 days, and the balance after 120 days. In addition to these mandatory deposit regulations, on June 23, 1977 the Central Bank authorized voluntary deposits at the Central Bank by financial and non- financial institutions of the outstanding balances of their foreign loans; these deposits may be released only on the maturity dates for payment of principal, interest, and commissions. For as long as the deposit remains with the Central Bank, the Central Bank covers all costs on these loans, including the exchange cost. As part of the measures announced on September 12, 1984, these provisions were modified as follows: (1) voluntary deposits at the Central Bank in respect of nonfinancial loans (under Law No. 4131) were frozen for an indefinite period, except for (a) funds required for interest and amortization payments on the deposited loan funds, (b) transformation of such loans into direct investment, or (c) in certain special cases, upon the prior approval of the Central Bank; and (2) 80 percent of the balance of voluntary deposits at the Central Bank in respect of financial loans (under Resolution No. 63), which could be released until December 31, 1984, were frozen for an indefinite period—the balance of 20 percent as well as similar deposits made after this date could be withdrawn within an initial period of 60 days, and subsequently within 180 days from deposit dates; where the funds are for use in the rollover of loans to domestic enterprises, prior notice of 15 days is required. Under a program for the management of external debt, the National Monetary Council imposes quantitative limits on the amount of financial loans for which authorization may be given by the Central Bank. Loans are authorized only if maturities conform with minimum requirements established from time to time by the Central Bank, which permits the total of loans outstand- ing to rise only to the extent that the servicing commit- ments on Brazil's total external indebtedness do not depart from the guidelines set by the National Monetary Council. At the end of 1985 the Central Bank's mini- mum acceptable maturity was set at nine years. How- ever, provided that the full amount of the foreign exchange remains committed to Brazil for the minimum ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution specified maturity, loans to the final borrower in Brazil, as well as loans to banks under Resolution No. 63, may be made at terms shorter than the final maturity of the debt abroad, and these funds may subsequently be re- lent to the same or a second borrower. Under the provisions of debt rescheduling agreements, a similar mechanism applies to the foreign exchange equivalent of affected principal repayments originally falling due during 1983-85. Outward capital transfers not mentioned above require authorization by DEC AM and FIRCE, which consider applications on their merits. Approved exchange transac- tions involving outward transfers of private capital are effected through authorized banks at the prevailing official market rate. Gold Firms authorized by the Government may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold coin in Brazil under Decree No. 1038 of October 21, 1969. Gold mining is con- ducted under Law No. 4425 of October 8, 1964. The domestic negotiation of newly mined gold is subject to a mining tax of 1 percent, which may be offset against other tax liabilities if and when the gold is manufactured. The Central Bank is empowered to buy and sell gold on the domestic market at international prices. In practice, purchases of gold in the domestic market are made at current domestic prices; the international price is consid- ered as a price goal. Imports of gold are subject to the issuance of an import certificate by CACEX. Exports of gold are subject to authorization by the Central Bank, which is always the alternative buyer. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement The cruzeiro was depreciated on a daily basis during 1985, from a midpoint rate of Cr$3,176 = US$1 on December 31, 1984, to a midpoint rate of Cr$10,465 = US$1 on December 31, 1985, representing a cumulative depreciation of 69.6 percent against the U .S. dollar (in terms of U .S. dollars per un it of local currency). January 1. The exchange tax on coffee exports was converted to a trade tax. In addition, the rate of the export tax credit was reduced from 7 percent to 5 percent of the value of eligible exports. (Under a previously adopted timetable, the tax credit was further reduced to 4 percent on February 1; 3 percent on March 1; 2 percent on April 1; and it was abolished on May 1, 1985.) January 8. The financial transactions tax was reduced to zero on sales of foreign exchange for imports of rice from member countries of the Latin American Integra- tion Association, provided that such imports were declared to be consistent with the supply policy of the federal government. March 21. Under a new method of exchange rate determination introduced with effect from April 1985, the rate of depreciation of the cruzeiro with respect to the U.S. dollar during a given month would be determined as the geometric average of the domestic rate of inflation BRAZIL during the preceding three months; on this basis, the Central Bank would publish at the beginning of each month a table setting out the exchange rate of the cruzeiro in terms of the U .S. dollar for each working day of the month. (This method remained in effect until September 15, 1985; see below.) June 5. It was decided that when an investment bank was connected to a commercial bank by common control, permission to deal in foreign exchange would be granted to only one of the two institutions. June 28. The 40 percent rebate on the tax payment by remitters of interest on loans, commissions, and ex- penses related to foreign transactions was reduced to zero. August 15. Conditions were defined under which foreign exchange sales to small business would be exempted from the financial transactions tax. August 15. The list of service imports for which sales of foreign exchange were subject to the financial transac- tions tax was revised. August 29. With effect from September 15, 1985, a new method of exchange rate determination was adopted under which the rate of depreciation of the cruzeiro with respect to the U .S. dollar between the fifteenth day of a given month and the fifteenth day of the following month would be equal to the domestic rate of inflation during the month covering the first of the two 15-day periods. On this basis, the Central Bank would announce each week the exchange rates for the cruzeiro in terms of the U .S. dollar that would prevail for each working day of the following week. August 30. The financial transactions tax was reduced to zero on sales of foreign exchange for imports of salt products during the remainder of 1985. September 6. The financial transactions tax was reduced to zero on sales of foreign exchange for imports of rice during the remainder of 1985 and for imports of potatoes during the period through November 15, 1985. December 31. The limit on Central Bank supply of foreign exchange to authorized banks to enable them to eliminate their oversold positions was raised from 90 percent to 100 percent of the sold position on the same day or on the previous day. Imports and Import Payments January 28. Materials and equipment imported for the construction and maintenance of shipping vessels were exempted from import duties. February 25. Materials imported for use in the 1985 census were exempted from import duties, provided that it could be established that there was no satisfactory domestic equivalent. May 17. Imports of steel products and nonferrous metals were made subject to prior approval by CACEX until April 1, 1988. August 26. Imports of raw materials, intermediate products, and spare parts required for production of certain capital goods exports were made eligible for exemption from import duties. 139 ©International Monetary Fund.

Export taxes on a number of items, which had been due to expire at the end of April 1985, were reduced from a range of 11-27 percent to a range of 0.6-9.8 percent and were extended indefinitely. (Such taxes had applied irrespective of destination for ladies' shoes, but had applied only to exports to the United States for the other affected items.) May 6. A special export tax of 3.51 percent was imposed on exports of concentrated orange juice to the United States. July 12. Export taxes of 5.63 percent were imposed on exports of certain types of motors to Canada. July 25. Quantitative limits were established on exports of sisal fiber to the United States and Canada for the period August 1985-July 1986. August 16.

Not for Redistribution BURKINA FASO (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Bu rk ina Faso is the CFA Franc ,1 which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. The official buying and selling rates are CFAF 50 = F 1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market and the fixed rate between the French franc and the CFA franc. The BCEAO levies a commission of 0.1 per mill for transfers from countries outside the West African Monetary Union and one of 2.5 per m i ll for transfers to such countries.2 Banks levy a commission of 2.5 per mill on transfers to all countries outside the West African Monetary Un ion, part of wh ich must be surren- dered to the Treasury. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of measures relating to gold and to the repatriation of export proceeds, Burk ina Faso's exchange controls do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked w i th the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Ben in, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Cote d'lvoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Directorate of the Treasury in the Ministry of Financial Resources. The approval authority in respect of exchange control (except for imports and exports of gold, forward exchange cover, opening of external accounts in foreign currency, and business travel allocations in excess of CFAF 400,000) has been delegated to the BCEAO and, within limits specified in the exchange control regula- tions, to authorized intermediaries. The BCEAO is also authorized to collect, either directly or through banks, financial institutions, the Postal Administration, and judicial agents, any information necessary to compile balance of payments statistics. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through authorized banks, the Postal Administration, or the BCEAO. Import and export licenses are issued by the Directorate-General of Commerce in the Ministry of Commerce and Supply. Import certificates for liberalized commodities and export attestations are made out by the importer or exporter himself and, when settlement takes !The CFA franc is issued by the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de 1'Quest (BCEAO) and is the common currency in Ben in, Burkina Faso, Cote d'lvoire, Ma l i, N iger, Senegal, and Togo. 2Transfers between member countries of the Un ion are subject to a flat commission of CFAF 100 levied on settlements between agencies of the BCEAO. place with a country outside the French Franc Area, are visaed by the Customs Administration. Prescription of Currency Since Burk ina Faso is an Operations Account country, settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the other Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any Operations Account country. Current transactions with The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are normally settled through the West African Clearing House. Certain settlements with the People's Republic of China, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Ghana3 are channeled through special accounts. Settlements with all other countries are usually effected either through correspon- dent banks in France, or the country concerned, in any of the currencies of those countries, or in French francs (or in other currencies of the French Franc Area) through Foreign Accounts in Francs. All settlements with South Africa are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. BCEAO bank notes may be credited to Foreign Accounts in Francs when they have been mailed to the BCEAO agency in Ouagadougou by an authorized bank's foreign corre- spondent. Otherwise, the crediting to nonresident ac- counts of BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, or bank notes issued by any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Trea- sury is prohibited. Foreign Accounts in Francs may be debited, without prior authorization, with the value of BCEAO bank notes mailed directly by authorized inter- mediaries to their foreign correspondents. Imports and Import Payments Imports of goods originating in or shipped from any country for commercial purposes and under any customs regulations may be made freely; however, for the purpose of monitoring, prior acquisition of an official import document may be necessary for imports exceed- ing an amount specified by the Minister of Commerce; an import license is required for those products subject to quota, and a prior import authorization is required for all other products. For imports subject to quota, a special commission (Commission des Importations) fixes the quotas and allocates them among importers. All other imports may require prior authorization, depending on the cir- cumstances. Noncommercial imports require a special 3A bilateral agreement was negotiated w i th Ghana in 1970 but is inoperative. 141 ©International Monetary Fund.

Imports of goods subject to special controls require the prior approval of the compe- tent ministry. On the other hand, imports of certain products, a list of which is established by decree, may be freed from the import document requirement. The Minister of Commerce may, on the basis of criteria established by his M in is try, waive the prescribed for- malities for imports from countries with which Burk ina Faso has concluded a customs un ion or free trade area agreement. Most imports are subject to a customs stamp tax of 6 percent, an import surcharge of 6 percent, and a statistical duty of 3 percent. All import transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value exceeds CFAF 500,000. Import licenses or import certificates entitle importers to purchase the necessary exchange not earlier than eight days before shipment, if a documentary credit is opened, on the due date for payment, if the commodities have already been im- ported, or at the time of the payment on account, if such a payment has to be made prior to the import. Payments for Invisibles All payments to South Africa are prohibited. Pay- ments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and other Operations Account countries are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to exchange control approval, which for many invisibles has been delegated to the authorized intermediaries. Authorized intermediary banks and the Postal Adminis- tration are empowered to make payments up to CFAF 50,000 a transfer to foreign countries on behalf of residents without requiring jus t i f ica t ion. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted. Residents traveling for tourism to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and other Opera- tions Account countries may purchase exchange equiva- lent to CFAF 175,000 a person a trip (CFAF 87,500 for children under ten years) for any number of trips a year; any foreign exchange in excess of CFAF 5,000 remain- ing after return to Burkina Faso must be surrendered. The basic allocation for travel abroad for business purposes is the equivalent of CFAF 20,000 a day, with a maximum of CFAF 400,000 a trip. Residents traveling to foreign countries may take out up to a maximum of CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, and bank notes of other Operations Account countries. Residents traveling to other countries of the French Franc Area may take out any amount in BCEAO bank notes, but if proceeding to a country that is not a member of the West African Monetary Un ion, they must declare to the customs the amount taken out if it exceeds CFAF 150,000. 142 Nonresident travelers may freely take out foreign bank notes up to the equivalent of CFAF 175,000, or any larger amoun t, if declared upon entry or acquired by draw ing on a Foreign Account in Francs, or an Account in Foreign Currency, or by exchange of foreign travel- er's checks, etc. They may also take out any foreign means of payment other than bank notes acquired in Bu rk ina Faso by debit to a Foreign Account in Francs or an Account in Foreign Currency, subject to submission of documen ta t ion. F ina l ly, they may take out freely up to CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, and bank notes of other Operations Account countries. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports and re-exports from Bu rk ina Faso may be made f ree ly. However, for the purpose of monitoring, exports or re-exports of certain products may require prior off ic ial authorization by the relevant services of the Ministry of Commerce, except in the case of certain goods, a l ist of which is established by decree. In accordance w i th criteria defined by the Minister of Commerce, exports of certain products may be subject to special regulations. Exports of any product may require prior special authorization from the relevant services of the Ministry of Commerce, depending on circumstances. Exports to Ghana are subject to special regulations. Export proceeds must be surrendered w i th in one month of the date on wh ich the payment falls due (the due date stipulated in the commercial contract, wh ich must not, in principle, be later than 180 days after arrival of the goods at their destination). All export transactions relating to foreign countries, inc lud ing countries in the French Franc Area, must be domiciled w i th an authorized bank when their value exceeds CFAF 500,000, and the exporter must sign a foreign exchange commitment and submit an export attestation form. Most exports are subject to a customs stamp tax of 6 percent and a statistical du ty of 3 percent. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles w i th France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be collected and surrendered w i th in two months of the due date. Such proceeds and earnings may not be received in or from South A f r ica. Resident and nonresi- dent travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BCEAO, the Bank of France, or any bank of issue ma in ta in ing an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) of countries outside the French Franc Area. Resident travelers must declare to the customs any foreign means of payment in excess of CFAF 5,000 that they bring in and must surrender these to an authorized bank w i th in eight days after return. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Capital All capital movements between Burkina Faso and South Africa are prohibited. Capital movements between Burkina Faso and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are free of ex- change control; capital transfers to all other countries require exchange control approval and are restricted, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. Special controls (additional to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable) are maintained over borrowing abroad, over inward direct investment and all outward investment, and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Burkina Faso. Such operations require prior authoriza- tion by the Minister of Financial Resources. Exempt from authorization, however, are operations in connec- tion with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Burkinabe Government, and (2) shares that are similar to or may be substituted for securities whose issue, adver- tising, or sale in Burkina Faso has already been autho- rized. With the exception of controls over foreign securities, these measures do not apply to France (as defined above), Monaco, member countries of the West African Monetary Un ion, and the Operations Account countries. Special controls are maintained also over imports and exports of gold, over the soliciting of funds for deposit w i th foreign private persons and foreign firms and institutions, and over publicity aimed at placing funds abroad or at subscribing to real estate and building operations abroad; these special controls also apply to France, Monaco, and the Operations Account countries. All the special provisions described in this paragraph apply only to transactions and not to the associated payments or collections. All investments abroad by residents of Burkina Faso require prior authorization by the Minister of Financial Resources4 and unless specifically exempted by the Minister of Financial Resources, 75 percent of such investments must be financed from borrowings abroad. Foreign direct investments in Burk ina Faso5 must be declared to the Minister of Financial Resources before they are made. The Minister has a period of two months from receipt of the declaration dur ing which he may request postponement of the project. The fu ll or partial liquidation of either type of investment also requires prior declaration to the Minister. Both the making and the liquidation of investments, whether these are Bur- kinabe investments abroad or foreign investments in Burkina Faso, must be reported to the Minister of Financial Resources. Direct investments constitute in- vestments implying control of a company or enterprise.

Foreign firms operating in Burkina Faso in vital or priority sectors are required to have Burkinabe participation in their capital of at least 51 percent and of at least 35 percent in all other sectors. The sale to residents of Burkina Faso of securities of foreign companies operating in Burkina Faso requires prior authorization by the Minister of Financial Resources, who establishes the sale value. Borrowing by residents from nonresidents requires prior authorization by the Minister of Financial Resources. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans constituting a direct invest- ment, which are subject to prior declaration, as indicated above; (2) loans taken up by industrial firms to finance operations abroad, by any type of firm to finance imports into or exports from Burkina Faso, or by international trading houses previously approved by the Minister of Financial Resources to finance international merchanting transactions; (3) loans contracted by authorized banks; and (4) loans other than those mentioned above, when the total amount outstanding of these loans, including the new borrowing, does not exceed CFAF 100 million for any one borrower, provided that the annual interest rate does not exceed the normal market rate and that the proceeds are immediately surrendered by the sale of foreign currency on the exchange market or debited to a Foreign Account in Francs. The repayment of loans not constituting a direct investment requires the special authorization of the Minister if the loan itself was subject to such approval but is exempt if the loan was exempt from special authorization. Lending abroad is subject only to exchange control authorization by the BCEAO, acting on behalf of the Minister of Financial Resources. The Investment Code provides preferential treatment for foreign investment in Burkina Faso, except for enterprises whose capital stock belongs entirely to foreigners. Three preferential categories (A, B, and C) are established, in accordance with which special guarantees and tax and customs incentives may be granted for up to eight years to any enterprise that undertakes to create or considerably expand activities likely to contribute to the country's economic and social development. Enterprises that the Government deems to be of a priority nature may also be given privileged treatment. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Burkina Faso. Imports and exports of gold from or to any other country require prior authoriza- tion by the Minister of Financial Resources. Exempt from this requirement are: (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the Treasury or the BCEAO; (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles); and (3) imports and exports of gold objects up to a combined weight of 500 grams by travelers.

Not for Redistribution BURMA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Burma is the Burmese Kya t, which is pegged to the SDR at K 8.50847 = SDR 1. Burma applies margins of 2 percent in respect of spot exchange transactions, based on the fixed kyat-SDR rate. The buying and selling rates of the kyat for the deutsche mark, the French franc, the Japanese yen, the pound sterling, the Swiss franc, and the U .S. dollar, quoted by the Myanma Foreign Trade Bank, are determined on the basis of the daily calculations of the value of these currencies against the SDR. On December 31, 1985 the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were K 7.7643 and K 7.9196, respectively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates for the Belgian franc, the Italian lira, and the Netherlands guilder are determined on the basis of appropriate cross rates in the New York market; buying and selling rates for the Hong Kong dollar, the Malaysian ringgit, and the Singapore dollar are deter- mined weekly on the basis of appropriate cross rates in the Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore markets, respectively; and buying and selling rates for other currencies are based on appropriate cross rates in local markets (e.g., Bombay, for the Indian rupee). There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Exchange Control Board, through the Myanma Foreign Trade Bank, in accordance with instructions from the Ministry of Planning and Finance. A Foreign Exchange Control Committee headed by the Minister of Planning and Finance is in charge of the allocation of foreign exchange. Prescription of Currency Burma has no bilateral payments agreements. Certain settlements with Bangladesh are channeled through a nonresident bank account at the Myanma Foreign Trade Bank, and certain settlements with India are channeled through special rupee accounts in that country. Payments to other countries may be made in any foreign currency or by crediting kyats to an External Account in Burma. Receipts must be collected in convertible currencies or to the debit of an External Account in Burma. Nonresident Accounts Foreign exchange accounts may be kept with the Myanma Foreign Trade Bank by international organiza- tions, diplomatic personnel, or other foreign residents, subject to approval by the Exchange Control Board. Such accounts are normally held in deutsche mark, In- dian rupees, pounds sterling, or U .S. dollars. They may be credited and debited freely, but no interest is pay- able on them. Foreign nationals temporarily resident in Burma are entitled to hold foreign exchange utilization cards for use in diplomatic shops. Nonresidents may be authorized to hold external accounts in kyats; all debits and credits to such accounts require prior authorization. Burmese nationals working abroad under permission from the Government may open accounts in U. S. dollars with the Myanma Foreign Trade Bank, Rangoon, out of their savings; with exchange control approval, withdraw- als from such accounts can be used for payment for personal imports and petty expenses. Imports and Import Payments All imports from South Africa are prohibited. Also prohibited are imports of a few commodities from any source —principally opium and other narcotics, mon- keys, playing cards, and gold and silver bullion. An import program is prepared annually as part of the foreign exchange budget drawn up by the Ministry of Planning and Finance. All imports involving use of official foreign exchange are made by the public sector through the Ministries. The Myanma Export-Import Corporation (MEIC) imports goods for the use of the private sector, whose requirements are estimated by the Central Trade Council. In general, state economic enterprises and departments import goods for their own use, including imports under loan and aid agreements, partly in their own names and partly in the name of the MEIC. Licenses are not required. A licensing fee of 5 percent of the c . i . f. value is levied on imports which are meant for resale, but imports for departmental use are exempted. Most imports are purchased on an f .o .b. basis, and shipments are made on vessels owned or chartered by the Burma Five Star Shipping Corporation whenever possible. All payments for imports are made through the Myanma Foreign Trade Bank. State eco- nomic enterprises obtain foreign exchange directly from the Myanma Foreign Trade Bank within the approved foreign exchange budget on endorsement by the respec- tive ministries. Foreign exchange allocations can be transferred by a ministry from one enterprise to another; transfers among ministries require cabinet approval. Imports not involving use of official foreign exchange do not require exchange control approval. Such imports for personal use generally do not require permits, but imports of certain durable items which are imported for personal use, such as cars, require specific permits. Burmese nationals working abroad as well as Burmese seamen are, however, permitted to import one vehicle every year. Seamen and other travelers may bring in a reasonable amount of personal goods when they enter the country. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles outside the public sector are subject to licensing. Since virtually all trade is 145 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BURMA exclusively handled by the state, there is no licensing for payments connected with foreign trade. Payments for most other purposes, including transfers of profits, interest, and dividends, are considered on a case-by-case basis. Payments for membership fees to educational or technical institutions abroad and payments for subscrip- tions to certain foreign periodicals are, as a rule, allowed freely. Family remittances are permitted only for foreign technicians employed under contract by the Govern- ment, the limit being one half of the net salary if the wife is living abroad, and one third of the net salary if the wife is living in Burma. Outward remittances of insurance premium payments other than for the Myanma Insurance Corporation are not permitted. The remittance of pension payments to retired government employees is permitted only if the persons concerned had been non-nationals throughout their term of service, and are now residing in their native countries. Most personal money order remittances to neighboring countries through post offices are not permitted. Foreign exchange allocations for tourist travel by residents have been suspended, except for approved religious pilgrimages. However, residents who have been granted an official permit to travel abroad for any other purpose may take out freely the equivalent of K 100 in the currency of the country of destination or, if that currency is not available, in U .S. dollar notes. Travel for medical reasons is authorized on a case-by- case basis. Travel for educational purposes is authorized only in connection with state scholarships. Otherwise, Burmese nationals are not allowed to travel abroad except on official missions or to take up employment offers abroad. On leaving, nonresident travelers who have stayed in the country for less than six months may take out any foreign currency they still hold and may also reconvert the remaining balance of the kyats obtained by conversion of foreign currency. Those who stay longer than six months must surrender all foreign currency in their possession but may be authorized by the Exchange Control Board to keep foreign currencies in foreign exchange accounts. The export of Burmese currency is prohibited. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. There is also a list of prohibited exports comprising iron and steel, brass, copper, and aluminum and scrap thereof, foreign manufactures, and commodities of domestic origin which need to be conserved for domestic require- ments. In practice, state agencies responsible for produc- tion may export any product in excess of the need for domestic consumption. Special permits are required for exports of antiques. Exports are generally effected by the MEIC, although timber, rubber, ju te, fish and fish products, coffee, hides and skins, minerals, and petro- leum and petroleum products may be exported directly by the respective state economic enterprises. Rice is exported by the Agriculture and Farm Produce Trade Corporation in the name of the MEIC. Export proceeds 146 must be obtained in a manner satisfactory to the exchange control authorities, i .e ., in approved convert- ible currencies or debits from the kyat account of banks in the importing country, and surrendered to the My- anma Foreign Trade Bank within six months from the date of shipment. Certain exports are subsidized through the Export Price Equalization Fund Account. When exports are made on an f .o .b. basis, buyers are free to choose the carrier, but exports on a c . i . f. basis are usually shipped by the Burma Five Star Shipping Corporation or on vessels chartered or nominated by it. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles must be surrendered unless otherwise specified by special permission from the exchange control authorities, which may grant such permission to foreign nationals residing in Burma in connection with official business. Travelers may bring in, subject to declaration, any amount in foreign cur- rency; foreign nationals who intend to stay for more than six months must surrender all foreign exchange in their possession unless special permission is given to the contrary. The import of Burmese currency is prohibited. Burmese nationals working abroad under permission from the Government are required to repatriate a part of their gross earnings in foreign exchange. In the case of Burmese seamen serving abroad, the repatriation re- quirement is 50 percent of basic pay, and it is credited to their bank accounts in kyat equivalent. Burmese nation- als working abroad in international organizations and not subject to income tax are required to repatriate 10 percent of their gross earnings in foreign exchange; the kyat equivalent is credited to the accounts of such nationals or their families. Burmese nationals working abroad in private organizations are required to remit as tax 10 percent of their gross earnings in foreign exchange through embassies in their country of residence. Capital There is no foreign investment code as such; in principle, investment proposals are considered by an Investment Committee to ascertain whether the proposed enterprise will utilize domestic raw materials, increase domestic employment, conserve foreign exchange, and generally conform to the economic plans of the Govern- ment. However, permission for foreign private invest- ment in Burma has been granted on only one occasion since 1963. All outward transfers of capital require prior approval. Residents are not permitted to remit funds abroad for investment. The repatriation of personal assets and the making of family remittances have been suspended, with minor exceptions, for foreign nationals employed in the private sector; those employed in the public sector may remit their personal savings when leaving the service. When the transfer abroad of payments in favor of nonresidents is not permitted, the authorities can allow such payments to be credited to external accounts in kyats. All debits and credits to these accounts require ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution prior permission. Ind iv idual licenses are required for the import, export, and transfer of securities invo lv ing nonresident interests. Gold Residents may hold and trade in gold jewe l ry, gold coin, and unworked gold in Burma. Licenses for imports and exports of gold are not granted un less they are effected by or on behalf of the monetary authorities. Jewelry for personal wear may be brought into Bu rma subject to customs declaration at the port of arrival. The export of personal jewe lry is permitted under license, subject to the condition that the jewelry w i ll be repatri- ated. No conditions are attached, however, to the taking out of personal jewe l ry that was declared to the customs when it was brought into Burma.

Imports and Import Payments All imports originating in or shipped from South Africa are prohibited. All imports require licenses, except trade samples without commercial value and merchandise not intended for sale whose declared con- sumer value c. & f. Bu jumbu ra is FBu 50,000 or less. Authorization to import goods for sale using the import- er's own foreign exchange is subject to prior payment of customs duties in foreign exchange. Such authorization is granted to approved importers in the form of li- censes not involving purchase of official foreign ex- change. Imports of certain pharmaceuticals are sus- pended, namely: conditioned amp ic i l l in, capsules of 250 and 500 milligrams; bactrim in tablets of 400 and 800 milligrams; meprobamate in tablets of 400 milli- grams; and phenobarbital in tablets. Importers have been instructed not to order abroad certain goods of wh ich domestic stocks are adequate or that are produced locally. Applications for licenses must be submitted to the Bank of the Republic of Burundi through an authorized bank. The approval of such an application constitutes an authorization also to obtain foreign exchange. With specified exceptions, authorized banks approve applications for licenses w i th a value not exceeding FBu 500,000 f .o .b. for transactions involving surface transportation; applications for amounts in ex- cess of FBu 500,000 require the approval of the Bank of the Republic of Bu rund i.

Persons leaving Bu rundi permanently are authorized to transfer abroad their holdings of Burundi francs that consist of unremitted savings or the sale proceeds of their personal effects. Transfer of rental income from foreign owners of new commercial, industrial, and office bu i ld- ings is permitted up to 50 percent of net rental income (after payment of taxes and deduction of 20 percent for maintenance expenses); the remainder, plus any accrued interest, may be transferred three years later, provided that the funds have been held on deposit w i th a domestic financial institution. For old buildings and new residen- tial buildings, transfer of 100 percent of rental income is permitted after placement of such income for at least five years in investment or savings bonds. Residents may apply for exchange needed for foreign travel. There is no fixed l im it on the amount that may be allocated, which depends on the nature of the travel. All travelers may take out up to FBu 2,000 in Bu rundi bank notes. In addition, residents may freely purchase foreign BURUNDI travel t icke ts, up to reasonable amoun ts, against pay- ment in Bu rundi francs. Nonresidents s tay ing in a hotel or guest house in Bu rundi must pay their hotel b i l ls by selling foreign currencies quoted by the Bank of the Republic of Bu rundi or by u s ing a credit card. Payment in Bu rundi francs is, however, acceptable in the case of guests for whom a resident company or ind iv idu al has assumed respons ib i l i ty and in the case of na t iona ls of Zaire or Rwanda who produce declarations of means of payment issued under the auspices of the Economic Commun i ty of the Great Lake Countries (CEPGL). Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South A f r ica are proh ib i ted. All exports valued above FBu 10,000 requ ire a prior declaration in each case, wh ich must be presented for certification by the Bank of the Repub l ic of Bu rundi through an authorized bank. Declarations are valid for 6 mon ths, but extensions may be granted by the Bank of the Republic of Bu rund i. Payments must be collected w i th in 90 days of the date of export declaration at the customs. All exchange proceeds from exports mu st be surrendered to an authorized bank w i t h in 8 days of the ir collection. Exports of arabica and robusta coffee from the Rumonge region are the monopoly of the B u r u n di Coffee Com- pany. V i r tua l ly all exports, in c lud ing coffee in some cases, are subject to export taxes and a statistical tax. Exports of manufac tured goods may receive a re fund of duties pa id, provided that they incorporate raw materials on wh ich import du ty has been pa id. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from inv i s ib les must be surrendered to authorized banks. Travelers may b r ing in any amount of foreign bank notes and up to FBu 2,000 in Bu rundi bank notes. Capital The Inves tment Code of August 25, 1967 provides tax and other bene f i ts for domestic and foreign private investors. A new Inves tment Law, adopted on April 4, 1979, revised some of the inves tment procedures. Under the Inves tment Code new inves tmen ts that f u l f i ll speci- fied conditions as to amount and economic importance may be granted priority status to wh ich specified privileges are attached, m a in ly in the form of exemptions from import du t ies and from taxes on income from the inves tmen t. Import du t ies and taxes may be reduced or suspended for goods and equ ipment needed for starting a particular project and, du r ing a period of five years, for other merchandise needed for the manu fac tu r ing opera- tion or for the upkeep of the original inves tmen t. Taxes on profits and real estate may l ikew ise be reduced or suspended. Enterprises accorded priority status may be granted a degree of protection against foreign competi- t ion, priority in the allocation of government contracts, and a guarantee from the Bank of the Repub l ic of Bu rundi for the free t rans fer of prof i ts and d iv idends and 149 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BURUNDI the repatriation of the invested capital. In addition to these privileges, companies undertaking investments that are considered to be of prime importance to Burund i's economic development may be granted, under a separate agreement, a guarantee that direct taxes on their activi- ties will not be increased for 15 years. An investment commission under the Planning Secretariat is responsible for examining requests for priority status and granting the necessary authorization. In addition, under the new law, Burundi guarantees each foreign investor the right to move into the country; foreign investors are also assured an allocation of foreign exchange for the purchase of raw materials abroad as well as for the repayment of loans taken out under the investment agreement. Capital transfers by residents require individual authorization, as does foreign capital on which a repatri- ation guarantee has been granted. The guarantee is furnished for foreign exchange imported by resident enterprises to provide working capital in foreign ex- change; it applies to any of the currencies quoted by the Bank of the Republic of Burundi and is valid for a one- year period and is renewable. The guarantee provides for the transfer of the original amount surrendered at the official rate ruling on the day of transfer. Under the new law, Burundi also guarantees the repatriation of invested capital in the event of sale or shutdown of the business. Gold All physical or juridical persons holding gold mining permits issued by the Ministers responsible for Mining and Customs may open purchasing houses for gold mined by artisans in Burundi. Gold produced by artisans may be sold only to approved houses. Exports of gold must be declared in Burundi francs at the average monthly rates communicated by the Bank of the Re- public of Burundi. Gold exports are authorized jointly by the Mining and Customs Departments. Changes During 1985 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 150 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CAMEROON (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Cameroon is the CFA Franc,l which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. Exchange transactions in French francs between the BEAC and commercial banks take place at the rate of CFAF 50 = F 1. Buying and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also officially posted, with quotations based on the fixed rate for the French franc and the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market. A commission of 0.50 percent is levied on transfers to countries that are not members of the BEAC, except transfers in respect of central and local government operations, payments for imports covered by a duly issued license domiciled with a bank, scheduled repay- ments on loans properly obtained abroad, travel allow- ances paid by the Government and its agencies for official missions, and payments of reinsurance pre- miums. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of those relating to gold, Came- roon's exchange control measures generally do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Ter- ritories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Cote d'lvoire, Gabon, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely, but all financial transfers in excess of CFAF 500,000 to countries of the French Franc Area must be declared to the authorities for statistical pur- poses. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Directorate of Economic Controls and External Finance in the Ministry of Finance. Exchange transactions relating to all coun- tries must be effected through authorized intermediaries, that is, the Postal Administration and authorized banks. Import licenses are issued by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and export licenses are issued by the Ministry of Finance. Prescription of Currency Since Cameroon is an Operations Account country, settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other Operations Account country. Settlements with all other 'The CFA franc circulating in Cameroon is issued by the Banque des Etats de 1'Afrique Centrale (BEAC) and is legal tender also in the Central African Republic, Chad, the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon. countries are usually made through correspondent banks in France in any of the currencies of those countries or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. All settlements between Cameroon and South Africa are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. BEAC bank notes may be credited to Foreign Accounts in Francs when mailed to the National Directorate of the BEAC in Yaounde by the foreign correspondents of authorized banks. Imports and Import Payments Imports from South Africa are prohibited. The import from all sources of certain "controlled" goods requires a special authorization (autorisation speciale d'importa- tion), in addition to an import license. All other imports, irrespective of origin, are subject to licensing when valued at CFAF 500,000 or more (CFAF 1 million or more in the case of large retail stores), but licenses are issued freely. All import transactions must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value exceeds CFAF 50,000. Import transactions by residents involving goods for use outside Cameroon must be domiciled with a bank in the country of final destination. Settlements for imports effected under an import license benefit from the authorization of uninterrupted transfer given to the authorized banks by the Ministry of Finance. Payments for Invisibles Payments in excess of CFAF 500,000 for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries require prior declaration but are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to the approval of the Ministry of Finance. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted freely, subject to declaration, when the basic transaction has been approved. For tourist travel, residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may obtain an exchange allocation of an amount equivalent to CFAF 200,000 a person a year; any foreign exchange remaining after return to Cameroon must be surrendered. For business travel, the corresponding allocation is the equivalent of CFAF 15,000 a day, subject to a maximum of CFAF 450,000 a trip. In practice, additional allocations may be allowed. The transfer of rent from real property owned in Cameroon by foreign nationals is limited, in principle, to 151 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CAMEROON 50 percent of the income declared for taxation purposes, net of tax. Remittances for current repair and manage- ment of real property abroad are normally limited to the equivalent of CFAF 200,000 every two or three years. Depending on family status, the transfer of 20 percent or 50 percent of the salary of a foreigner working in Cameroon is permitted upon presentation of the appro- priate pay voucher, provided that the transfer takes place within one month of the pay period concerned. Except in the case of foreigners working in Cameroon temporarily, payments of insurance premiums to foreign countries are not permitted if the same type of insurance is available in Cameroon. Resident and nonresident travelers to coun- tries outside the French Franc Area may take out up to CFAF 20,000 in BE AC bank notes. Travelers to other countries of the French Franc Area may, subject to prior declaration, take out any amount in BE AC bank notes. Nonresident travelers may take out foreign bank notes and coin up to the amount declared by them on entry, or up to CFAF 50,000 if no declaration was made. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. Export transactions valued at CFAF 50,000 or more must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Exports to all countries are subject to domiciliation requirements for the appropriate documents. Proceeds from exports to all countries must be repatriated within 15 days of the payment date stipulated in the sales contract, and proceeds received in currencies, other than those of France or an Operations Account country, must be surrendered within a month after collection. Payments for exports must be made within 30 days from the arrival date of the merchandise at its destination. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services, and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets, must be collected within a month of the due date and surrendered within a month of collection if received in foreign currency. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BE AC, the Bank of France, or a bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) of countries outside the French Franc Area. Capital Capital movements between Cameroon and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are free of exchange control. Capital transfers to all other countries require exchange control approval and are restricted, but capital receipts from such coun- tries are permitted freely. Emigrants to countries out- side the French Franc Area may transfer abroad their 152 fu ll savings, provided that they have met their tax obligations. With the exception of controls over the sale or introduction of foreign securities in Cameroon, the controls on capital movements do not apply to relations with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries. All foreign securities and titles embodying claims on nonresidents must be depos- ited with an authorized intermediary and be classified as foreign, whether they belong to residents or non- residents. Direct investments abroad2 require the prior approval of the Ministry of Finance, unless they take the form of a capital increase resulting from reinvestment of undis- tributed profits; the fu ll or partial liquidation of such investments requires only a report after the fact to the Minister of Finance, unless the operation involves the relinquishing of a participation that had previously been approved as constituting a direct investment abroad. Foreign direct investments in Cameroon3 require prior declaration to the Minister of Finance, unless they take the form of a capital increase resulting from reinvestment of undistributed profits; the Minister has a period of two months from receipt of the declaration during which he may request postponement. The full or partial liquidation of direct investments in Cameroon requires only report- ing to the Minister of Finance, unless the operation involves the relinquishing of a participation that had previously been approved as constituting a direct invest- ment in Cameroon. Both the making and the liquidation of direct investments, whether these are Cameroonian investments abroad or foreign investments in Cameroon, must be reported to the Minister of Finance within 20 days following each operation. Direct investments are defined as investments implying control of a company or enterprise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Cameroon requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance and must subsequently be reported to him. Exempt from authorization, however, and subject only to a report after the fact are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Cameroonian Government, and (2) shares similar to securities whose issue, advertising, or offering for sale in Cameroon has already been authorized. Borrowing abroad by physical or juridical persons, whether public or private, whose normal residence or registered office is in Cameroon, or by branches or subsidiaries in Cameroon of juridical persons whose registered office is abroad, requires prior authorization Including those made through foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in Cameroon and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Cameroon.

Not for Redistribution by the Minister of Finance, and must subsequently be reported to him. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization, and require only a report: (1) loans directly connected with the rendering of services abroad by the persons or firms mentioned above, or with the financing of commercial transactions either between Cameroon and countries abroad or be- tween foreign countries, in which these persons or firms take part; and (2) loans contracted by registered banks and credit institutions. Lending abroad by physical and juridical persons, whether public or private, whose normal residence or registered office is in Cameroon, or by branches or subsidiaries in Cameroon of juridical persons whose registered office is abroad, requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance and must subsequently be reported to him. The following are, however, exempt from prior authorization, and require only a report: (1) loans constituting a direct investment abroad for which prior approval has been obtained, as indicated above; (2) loans directly connected with the rendering of services abroad by the persons or firms mentioned above, or with the financing of commercial transactions either between Cameroon and countries abroad or be- tween foreign countries, in which these persons or firms take part; and (3) loans not exceeding CFAF 500,000, provided the maturity does not exceed two years and the rate of interest does not exceed 6 percent a year. Under the Investment Code promulgated in July 1984, four categories of fiscal benefits may be granted to foreign and domestic firms undertaking new projects in the agricultural, livestock, forestry, tourism, construc- tion, public works, mining, and industrial equipment maintenance sectors. The Investment Code aims to promote sectors considered strategic in the development plan, to generate employment and foreign exchange, and to geographically diversify economic activity. The type and duration of benefits vary according to, inter alia, the size of the investment, the location of the enterprise, the economic activity undertaken, the factor mix, and the production techniques employed. Category A benefits, to last over a period of ten years, apply to promotional enterprises investing over the period no less than CFAF 500 million, and satisfying a number of prerequi- sites. The benefits consist of the reduction (to 5 percent) of taxes and duties on imported goods and their exemp- tion on domestic purchases of equipment, spare parts, CAMEROON and raw materials. Category B benefits, which apply to firms in priority sectors investing no less than CFAF 2.5 billion, include, in addition to those under Category A, a number of other fiscal benefits related to property transfers and amortizations for a period of five years. Category C benefits apply to small- and medium-size enterprises with an investment level of CFAF 500 million over a 10-year period. Benefits include exemption from a number of asset and income levies. The duration of the benefits extends to 15 years for firms operating outside the areas of highest industrial concentration. Finally, under Category D, strategic firms investing over CFAF 5 billion in 5 years may enjoy the same benefits as under Category B and are guaranteed the maintenance of the fiscal regime for 15 years. Ordinance No. 73/27 of August 30, 1973 provided that public entities should hold at least one third of the share capital of each banking institution and that the headquar- ters of each banking institution should be in Cameroon. This ordinance also required banks with foreign majority participation to submit to the monetary authorities information on all their current transactions abroad and to obtain prior approval for any changes in the structure of their equity holdings. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold jewelry in Cameroon. They require the approval of the Directorate of Mines to hold gold in any other form. Such approval is normally given only to industrial users, including jewelers. Newly mined gold must be declared to the Directorate of Mines, which authorizes either its exportation or its sale to domestic industrial users; exports are made only to France. Imports and exports of gold require prior authorization by the Directorate of Mines and the Minister of Finance, which is seldom granted for imports. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, and (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles). Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Changes During 1985 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 153 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CANADA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Canada is the Canadian Dollar. The authorities of Canada do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions, and exchange rates are deter- mined on the basis of demand and supply conditions in the exchange market; however, the authorities inter- vene from time to time to maintain orderly conditions in that market. The principal intervention currency is the U .S. dollar. The closing interbank market rate for the U .S. dollar on December 31, 1985 was Can$ 1.3983 per US$1. Forward exchange rates are similarly deter- mined in the market, and it is not the practice of the authorities to intervene. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. On March 25, 1952 Canada notified the Fund that it was prepared to accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Prescription of Currency No prescription of currency requirements are in force. Imports and Import Payments Import licenses are required only for certain drugs; a few agricultural items; certain textile products, clothing, and footwear; certain endangered species of fauna and flora; natural gas; and material and equipment for the production or use of atomic energy. For some agricul- tural items, such as certain dairy products, licenses are generally not being issued. Commercial imports of certain commodities from any source are tightly con- trolled or prohibited; the main products affected are oleomargarine and used automobiles. Imports of wom- en's and girls' nonrubber footwear are subject to a global quota. Imports of clothing and certain textile products from low-cost sources are subject to bilateral agree- ments. Imports of automobiles from Japan are effected within the framework of a bilateral understanding aimed at ensuring that such imports grow in a manner consis- tent with the expansion of total demand in the Canadian market. Exports and Export Proceeds The surrender of the proceeds from exports is not required, and exchange receipts are freely disposable. For security reasons, there is export control on strategic goods to all destinations except the United States. All exports to Albania, Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic and East Berlin, Hungary, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Roma- n ia, the U .S .S .R ., and Viet Nam are subject to control, although certain goods of Canadian origin may be exported to these destinations under the authority of a general export permit. All exporters are eligible for 154 certain financial facilities operated by the Export Devel- opment Corporation (EDC), including political risk insurance. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles No exchange control requirements are imposed on exchange payments for, or exchange receipts from, invisibles. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or payments by residents or nonresidents. Apart from specific restrictions in the financial, broad- casting, and uranium sectors, inward direct investment is governed by the Investment Canada Act, under which new foreign investments in industries other than those deemed to be culturally sensitive are subject to notification but not review, and direct takeovers involv- ing assets of less than Can$5 million (Can$50 million for indirect takeovers) are exempt from review. Takeover bids that are subject to review are required only to pass a test of yielding net benefit to Canada. There are no controls over outward direct investment, nor over inward or outward portfolio investment. Although higher ratios may be authorized on a case-by-case basis, in general the domestic assets of a foreign-owned bank operating in Canada must not exceed 20 times its authorized capital; the total domestic assets of all such banks must not exceed 16 percent of the total domestic assets of all banks operating in Canada. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad. However, exports of gold and all other products containing gold to countries named in the Area Control List require an export permit from the Minister of Industry, Trade, and Commerce under the authority of the Export and Import Per- mits Act. Gold of U .S. origin requires a permit when re-exported to all countries except the United States. Commercial imports of articles containing minor quan- tities of gold, such as watches, are unrestricted and free of license. Legal tender gold coins with a face value of Can$100 have been issued annually since 1976, and Can$50 "bullion" coins, containing one ounce of gold, have also been issued since 1979. Beginning in 1982, Can$10 and Can$5 coins containing V4 and l/io ounce of gold, respectively, have also been issued. Changes During 1985 Imports and Import Payments January 1. In line with GATT obligations, Canada commenced implementation of the International Agree- ment on Customs Valuation. In addition, more items were brought under the coverage of existing bilateral ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution export restraint arrangements as follows: Sri Lanka (winter outerwear), Thailand (underwear), and Singa- pore (underwear). March 18. The Prime Minister of Canada and the President of the United States announced the establish- ment of a bilateral mechanism to chart all possible ways to reduce and eliminate existing barriers to trade between the two countries. May 1. The General Preferential Tariff (GPT) rate was withdrawn for three years with respect to imports of rubber inner tubes, excluding bicycle tubes. May 23. The budget of May 23, 1985 introduced legislation to raise the free General Preferential Tariff rate on motor vehicle parts to two thirds of the Most Favored Nation (MFN) rate and proposed an increase in the GPT tariff on automobiles and other motor vehicles from developing countries to two thirds of the MFN rate, beginning on January 1, 1987. Several amendments were also introduced to provide for lower rates of duty on various goods not made in Canada, as well as provision for duty-free entry for certain imports from developing countries, including field hockey sticks, handrolled cigars, timber, lumber, and wood moldings. The budget also introduced legislation allowing Cana- dian travelers to import, free of duties and taxes, goods worth up to CanSlOO any number of times during the year after an absence of at least 48 hours abroad. (Previous provisions limited such importation to once a calendar year.) June 1. Under Article 3 of the Multi-Fiber Agreement (MFA), a unilateral restraint was placed on imports of sportswear from Malaysia. (This measure was replaced by a bilateral agreement in October 1985.) June 11. Global quotas on imports of beef and veal were raised as a result of consultations with suppliers. July 1. Imports of T-shirts and sweatshirts from Brazil were brought under the special arrangement on control of imports of clothing items from that country. CANADA July 3. Canada and Japan confirmed their understand- ing with respect to Japanese automobile exports to Canada for the period April 1, 1985 to March 31, 1986, namely, that such Japanese exports would be allowed to grow in a manner consistent with the total growth in the Canadian market. On this basis, it was expected that Japanese exports would amount to about 18 percent of the 1985/86 market, a level in un it terms significantly above 1984/85, in line with the prevailing robust state of automobile sales in Canada. September 17. An agreement was reached with In- donesia to add eight products (blouses, sportswear, sweaters, sleepwear, underwear, jackets, outer shorts, and winter outerwear) to the coverage of the existing bilateral restraint arrangement on Canadian imports from that country. September 26. The Prime Minister announced Canada's interest in negotiating a free trade arrangement with the United States. October 4. A bilateral restraint agreement was reached with Bangladesh in regard to imports of tailored-collar shirts and jackets from that country. October 29. Royal assent was given to the legislation implementing, with effect from May 24, 1985, the tariff amendments introduced in the May 23 budget. November 20. With effect from December 1, 1985, the Government announced a new regime for footwear quotas, providing for the termination of all foot- wear quotas, with the exception of women's and girls' footwear. The remaining quotas were to be phased out over the following three years, with increases in quota levels of 6 percent the first year, 8 percent the second year, and 10 percent the third year. November 22. The Government announced that Canada would seek enabling authority to join w i th the United States and Japan in eliminating tariffs on com- puter parts and semiconductors. 155 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CAPE VERDE (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Cape Verde is the Cape Verde Escudo, which is pegged to a weighted basket of currencies representing nine important trading partners. The exchange rate of the Cape Verde escudo in terms of the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, is fixed daily on the basis of quotations for the U .S. dollar and the other currencies included in the basket. On Decem- ber 31, 1985 the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were C .V. Esc 85.07 and C .V. Esc 85.68, respectively, per US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control All foreign exchange transactions are under the con- trol of the Directorate of Foreign Relations and Ex- change Control (DRECC), which is a department of the Bank of Cape Verde (the central bank). All imports, exports, and re-exports are subject to licensing, except for transactions not exceeding C.V. Esc 2,500. Foreign exchange transactions, including the surrender of foreign exchange proceeds, are effected through the central bank. Prescription of Currency The central bank determines the currency in which export proceeds should be repatriated. Cape Verde has bilateral payments agreements with Angola and Sao Tome and Principe. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents may open demand deposit accounts in local currency. These accounts may be credited only with the proceeds from the sale or surrender of receipts of convertible currencies and may be debited for pay- ment of any obligations in Cape Verde. Outward transfers of balances from such accounts may be made freely. Embassies and foreign officials of embassies are required to open special accounts in foreign currency and in local currency; such accounts must be replenished exclusively with foreign exchange. Special Accounts (Emigrants) Three types of special interest-bearing deposit ac- counts are available for emigrants: (a) foreign exchange deposit accounts; (b) savings-credit deposit accounts; and (c) special accounts in Cape Verde escudos. These accounts can only be credited with convertible foreign currencies. Holders of savings-credit deposit accounts 156 can benefit from loans on special terms for financing small-scale projects. Imports and Import Payments All imports are subject to licensing, except for transactions not exceeding C .V. Esc 2,500. Licenses, which are issued by the General Directorate of Com- merce in the State Secretariat for Trade and Tourism, require the visa of the central bank and are generally valid for 90 days, but are renewable. The provision of foreign exchange is guaranteed when the license has been previously certified by the central bank. Licenses are in general granted liberally for imports of medicines, capital goods, and other development-related equipment. Imports of nonessentials are restricted. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require prior authoriza- tion. Transfers for tourism are limited to a maximum of C .V. Esc 6,000 a person a year (C .V. Esc 3,000 for children under 15 years). When traveling accompanied by his family, a resident of Cape Verde may take out in foreign currency the equivalent of C .V. Esc 6,000 plus C .V. Esc 4,000 for each family member under 15, but the total transfer for each family may not exceed the equivalent of C .V. Esc 20,000. Cape Verdean nationals emigrating or going on tourist trips abroad are required to buy round-trip tickets in advance and to make a deposit equivalent to a one-way ticket to the country of destination; this deposit is refunded upon return to Cape Verde. Cape Verdean nationals studying abroad are allowed up to a maximum of C .V. Esc 6,000 on leaving the country, and students who do not hold scholarships are, in addition, entitled to C .V. Esc 5,000 a month. The equivalent of C .V. Esc 20,000 is authorized for each business trip and C .V. Esc 15,000 a trip for medical treatment; these latter amounts may be increased upon presentation of evidence of need. Transfers by foreign technical assistance personnel working in Cape Verde are authorized within the limits specified in the individual contracts. These contracts, as well as other contracts involving foreign exchange expenditures, are subject to prior screening by the central bank. Requests by other foreigners are examined on a case-by-case basis. The export of domestic currency by travelers is prohibited. Foreign travelers may bring in any amount of foreign currency but may re-export only up to the amount of currency declared upon entry. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports are subject to licensing and to approval by the central bank, except for transactions not exceeding C .V. Esc 2,500. Export proceeds must be repatriated ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CAPE VERDE within three months from the date of issuance of the license, but this period may be extended. may be re-exported without limitation. The export of resident-owned capital is not normally permitted. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles must be surrendered to the central bank. The import of Cape Verdean bank notes is prohibited. Gold Imports, exports, or re-exports of gold either in coin or bars require prior licensing by the monetary authorities. Capital Any private capital transaction must be approved in advance by the central bank, but legally imported capital Changes During 1985 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 157 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Central African Republic is the CFA Franc,1 which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. Exchange transactions in French francs between the BEAC and commercial banks take place at the rate of CFAF 50 = F 1, free of commission. Buying and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also officially posted, with quotations based on the fixed rate for the French franc and the rates for the currencies concerned in the Paris exchange market. A commission of 0.25 percent is levied on all capital transfers to countries that are not members of the BEAC, except those made for the account of the Treasury and for the expenses of students. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of those relating to gold, the exchange control measures of the Central African Re- public do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Cote d'lvoire, Gabon, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control All draft legislation, directives, correspondence, and contracts having a direct or indirect bearing on the finances of the State require the prior approval of the Minister of Finance, who has delegated his approval authority to the Director of the Budget. The Autonomous Amortization Fund (CAADE) in the Ministry of Finance supervises borrowing abroad, while the Office of For- eign Financial Relations in the same ministry supervises lending abroad, issuing, advertising, or offering for sale foreign securities in the Central African Republic, and inward and outward direct investment. Exchange control is administered by the Minister of Finance, who has delegated some of his approval authority to the BEAC,2 to the authorized banks, and to the Postal Adminis- tration. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through authorized banks. Import and export licenses are issued by the Directorate of Foreign Trade in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, except those for gold, which are issued by the BEAC. *The CFA franc circulating in the Central African Republic is issued by the Banque des Etats de 1'Afrique Centrale (BEAC) and is legal tender also in Cameroon, Chad, the Congo, and Gabon. 2The authority delegated to the BEAC relates to (1) the control over the external position of the banks, (2) the granting of exceptional travel allocations in excess of the basic allowances, and (3) the control over the repatriation of net export proceeds. 158 Prescription of Currency Since the Central African Republic is an Operations Account country, settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other institute of issue that maintains an Opera- tions Account with the French Treasury. Settlements with all other countries are usually made in any of the currencies of those countries or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. The principal nonresi- dent accounts are Foreign Accounts in Francs. BEAC bank notes received by the foreign correspondents of authorized banks and mailed to the BEAC agency in Bangui by the Bank of France or the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de 1'Ouest (BCEAO) may be credited freely to Foreign Accounts in Francs. Imports and Import Payments All imports from South Africa are suspended. The import from all countries of a few commodities that are also produced domestically is prohibited. The import of certain foodstuffs is not authorized unless local produc- tion of these commodities is inadequate. Imports of certain goods, when not originating in a member country of the Central African Customs and Economic Union (UDEAC), may be made only in given ratios to purchases of the local product. The import of firearms is prohibited irrespective of origin. All other imports from countries in the French Franc Area may be made freely and without an import license. All other imports from EC countries (the original member states) are also free from quantitative restrictions. Imports from all countries outside the French Franc Area are subject to licensing within the framework of an annual import program. All import transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank. The import license entitles importers to purchase the necessary exchange, provided that the shipping documents are submitted to the authorized bank. There has been some accrual of arrears on external payments owing to the imposition of statutory ceilings on central bank credit to the Govern- ment and an ensuing shortage of domestic currency with which to purchase foreign exchange. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to approval. For many types of payment the approval authority has been delegated to authorized banks. Pay- ments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, divi- dends, and royalties are also permitted freely when the basic transaction has been approved. Residents traveling as tourists to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may obtain an exchange allocation of an amount equivalent to CFAF 50,000 a year for each person; of this allocation, an amount equivalent to CFAF 25,000 may be taken out in foreign bank notes. Any exchange in excess of the equivalent of CFAF 5,000 that remains after return to the Central African Republic must be surrendered. For business travel to foreign countries, there is a special allocation of the equivalent of CFAF 10,000 a person a day, subject to a maximum of CFAF 100,000 a trip, for travel to certain listed countries; the allocation for business travel to any other foreign country is CFAF 15,000 a day, up to CFAF 150,000 a trip; of this allocation, an amount equivalent to CFAF 5,000 may be taken out in foreign bank notes. The transfer of the entire net salary of a foreigner working in the Central African Republic is permitted upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher, provided that the transfer takes place within three months of the pay period. Travelers to foreign countries may take out up to a maximum of CFAF 10 $00 in BE AC bank notes, French bank notes, and bank notes issued by any other institute of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury. Travelers to other countries may take out any amount in BEAC bank notes. Nonresident travelers may take out foreign currency and other foreign means of payment up to the amount declared by them on entry; they may reconvert up to CFAF 50,000 in BEAC bank notes into foreign currency. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are suspended. All exports of cotton, coffee, corn, tobacco, peanuts, palm oil, meat, and diamonds require a license. All other exports to countries in the French Franc Area may be made freely. All exports to countries outside this area require licenses, which are issued freely. Proceeds from exports to foreign countries must be collected and repatriated within one month from the due date; the latter must not be later than 90 days after the arrival of the goods at their destination, unless special authorization is obtained. Export proceeds received in currencies other than those of France or an Operations Account country must be surrendered. All export trans- actions must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services, and all CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC income earned in those countries from foreign assets, must be collected within a month of the due date and, if received in foreign currency, surrendered w i th in a month of the date of receipt. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BEAC, the Bank of France, or any other bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) of countries outside the French Franc Area. Capital Capital movements between the Central African Re- public and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require exchange control approval and are restricted, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. All foreign borrowing by the Government or its public and semipublic enterprises, as well as all foreign borrowing with a government guarantee, requires the prior approval of the Director of the Budget. Special controls (additional to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable) are maintained over borrowing and lending abroad, over inward and outward direct investment, and over the issuing, adver- tising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in the Central African Republic; these controls relate to the transactions themselves, not to payments or receipts. With the exception of those controls over the sale or introduction of foreign securities in the Central African Republic, the measures do not apply to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries. Direct investments abroad3 require the prior approval of the Ministry of Finance unless they take the form of a capital increase resulting from reinvestment of undis- tributed profits; the full or partial liquidation of such investments also requires the prior approval of the Ministry of Finance unless the operation involves the relinquishing of a participation that had previously been approved as constituting a direct investment abroad. Foreign direct investments in the Central African Re- public4 must be declared to the Minister of Finance, unless they take the form of a capital increase resulting from reinvestment of undistributed profits; the Minister has a period of two months from receipt of the declaration during which he may request postponement. The fu ll or partial liquidation of direct investments in the Central African Republic must also be declared to the Minister, unless the operation involves the relinquishing of a participation that had previously been approved as 3Including those made through foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in the Central African Republic and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in the Central African Republic. 4Including those made by companies in the Central African Republic that are directly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries of foreign countries in the Central African Republic. 159 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC constituting a direct investment in the Central African Republic. Both the making and the liquidation of direct investments, whether these are Central African Republic investments abroad or foreign investments in the Central African Republic, must be reported to the Minister within 20 days following each operation. Direct invest- ments are defined as investments implying control of a company or an enterprise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in the Central African Republic requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. Exempt from authorization, however, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Govern- ment, and (2) shares similar to securities whose issuing, advertising, or offering for sale in the Central African Republic has previously been authorized. Borrowing abroad by physical or juridical persons, whether public or private, whose normal residence or registered office is in the Central African Republic, or by branches or subsidiaries in the Central African Republic of juridical persons whose registered office is abroad, requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authoriza- tion: (1) loans constituting a direct investment abroad for which prior approval has been obtained, as indicated above; (2) loans directly connected with the rendering of services abroad by the persons or firms mentioned above, or with the financing of commercial transactions either between the Central African Republic and coun- tries abroad or between foreign countries, in which those persons or firms take part; (3) loans contracted by registered banks; and (4) loans other than those men- tioned above, when the total amount outstanding of the loans does not exceed CFAF 50 million for any one borrower. The contracting of loans referred to under (4) that are free of authorization, and each repayment thereon, must be reported to the Office of Foreign Financial Relations within 20 days of the opera- tion, unless the total outstanding amount of all loans contracted abroad by the borrower is less than CFAF 500,000. Lending abroad by physical or juridical persons, whose normal residence or registered office is in the Central African Republic, or by branches or subsidiaries in the Central African Republic of juridical persons whose registered office is abroad, requires prior authori- zation by the Minister of Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans granted by registered banks, and (2) other loans when the total amount outstanding of the loans does not exceed CFAF 50 million for any one lender. The making of loans that are free of authorization, and each repayment thereon, must be reported to the Office of Foreign Financial Relations within 20 days of the operation, except when the amount of the loan granted abroad by the lender is less than CFAF 500,000. Under Law No. 62/355 of February 19, 1963 (as amended by Ordinance No. 69/47 of September 2, 1969) and UDEAC Decision No. 18/65 of December 14, 1965, industrial, tourist, agricultural, and mining enterprises (both foreign and domestic) established in the Central African Republic are granted, under certain conditions, a reduction in duties and taxes on the import of specified equipment; in addition, certain enterprises receive ex- emption from direct taxes on specified income. The law also provides for three categories of preferen- tial treatment in accordance with which fiscal and other privileges may be accorded to firms investing in new enterprises or in the expansion of existing ones in most sectors of the economy, except the commercial sector. Requests for approval for preferential treatment must be submitted to the Minister of Industry, who is the Chairman of the Investment Commission, which con- siders the application. If a positive decision is given by the Commission, the proposed authorization is submitted to the Council of Ministers. Preferential treatments A and C are granted by decree issued by the Council of Ministers. Preferential treatment B is granted by an Act of the Board of Directors of the former Equatorial Customs Union upon the recommendation of the Council of Ministers. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in the Central African Republic. Imports and exports of gold from or to any other country require a license, which is seldom granted; in practice, imports and exports are made by an authorized purchas- ing office. Exempt from prior authorization are (1) im- ports and exports by or on behalf of the Treasury, and (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles contain- ing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold- plated articles). Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Certain companies have been officially appointed as Offices for the Purchase, Import, and Export of Gold and Raw Diamonds. Changes During 1985 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 160 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CHAD (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Chad is the CFA Franc,1 which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. Exchange transac- tions in French francs between the BE AC and commer- cial banks take place at the rate of CFAF 50 = F 1. Buying and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also officially posted, with quotations based on the fixed rate for the French franc and the rates for the currencies concerned in the Paris exchange market. A commission of 0.25 percent is levied on all capital transfers to countries that are not members of the BEAC, except those made for the account of the Treasury and for the expenses of students. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of those relating to gold, Chad's exchange control measures do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Cen- tral African Republic, the Comoros, the Congo, Cote d'lvoire, Gabon, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control The Office of the Minister of Economy and Commerce supervises borrowing and lending abroad, the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Chad, and inward and outward direct investment; it also issues import and export authorizations for gold. Ex- change control is also administered by the Minister of Economy and Commerce, who has delegated his approv- al authority in part to the authorized banks. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be ef- fected through authorized banks. Import and export licenses are issued by the Foreign Trade Office in the Ministry of Economy and Commerce. Prescription of Currency Since Chad is an Operations Account country, set- tlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury. Settlements with all other countries are usually made through correspondent banks in France in any of the currencies of those countries or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. lrThe CFA franc circulating in Chad is issued by the Banque des Etats de 1'Afrique Centrale (BEAC) and is legal tender also in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Congo, and Gabon. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. BEAC bank notes may be credited freely to Foreign Accounts in Francs main- tained by the foreign correspondent of an authorized bank, provided that the notes are mailed to the BEAC agency in Chad, by the correspondent bank concerned. Imports and Import Payments Imports from South Africa are prohibited. Imports of wheat, wheat flour, and sugar from all sources require licenses. All other imports from countries in the French Franc Area and from EC countries (the original member states), other than France, may be made freely. All imports from non-EC countries outside the French Franc Area are subject to licensing in accordance with an annual import program. This program and the amount of foreign exchange required to implement it are deter- mined by the Minister of Economy and Commerce on the basis of proposals drawn up by the Committee on Imports. The import program contains global quotas for im- ports from non-EC countries outside the French Franc Area and a special quota for imports of cotton textiles from countries with abnormal competitive advantages. In addition, the program contains global quotas for imports of wheat, wheat flour, and sugar from EC countries, countries in the French Franc Area, as well as other countries. Specified imports from certain neigh- boring countries not belonging to the French Franc Area up to a value of CFAF 3 million a year in each direction for a single importer may be made through compensation transactions. The issuance of import licenses for sugar and a specified brand of cigarettes has been suspended until further notice. All import transactions valued at CFAF 100,000 or more and relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Import licenses entitle import- ers to purchase the necessary exchange, provided that the shipping documents are submitted to the authorized bank. Forward cover for imports from foreign countries is permitted only for specified commodities and requires the prior approval of the Office of the Minister of Economy and Commerce. There has been some accumu- lation of arrears on external payments owing to the imposition of statutory ceilings on central bank credit to the Government and an ensuing shortage of domestic currency with which to purchase foreign exchange. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to approval. For many types of payment the approval 161 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CHAD authority has been delegated to authorized banks. Pay- ments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, divi- dends, and royalties are also permitted freely when bona fide. Some current payments, however, may be subject to delay. For tourist travel, residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may obtain an exchange allocation of an amount equivalent to CFAF 200,000 a person a trip, for any number of trips a year. For pilgrimage to Mecca, an additional allocation of the equivalent of CFAF 200,000 may be granted. For business travel to foreign countries, there is a daily allocation of the equivalent of CFAF 60,000, with a maximum allocation of the equivalent of up to CFAF 500,000 a person a trip; the Office of the Minister of Economy and Commerce may approve additional amounts. Travelers to foreign countries may take out up to a maximum of CFAF 30,000 in BEAC bank notes. Travelers to other countries may take out any amount in BEAC bank notes. Nonresident travelers may take out foreign bank notes and coin up to the amount declared by them on entry, in addition to amounts remitted from foreign bank ac- counts. If no declaration has been made, they may take out up to the equivalent of CFAF 150,000, in addition to a maximum of CFAF 30,000 in BEAC bank notes. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to South Africa are prohibited. All exports to non-EC countries outside the French Franc Area require licenses. Specified exports to certain neighboring coun- tries, including Nigeria and Sudan, may be made through compensation transactions. Exports of cotton are the monopoly of the Societe Cotonniere du Tchad (COTONTCHAD). Export transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value exceeds CFAF 50,000. Export proceeds received in currencies other than those of France (as defined above), Monaco or an Operations Account country must be surrendered. Export proceeds normally must be received within 180 days after the arrival of the commodities at their destination. The proceeds must be collected, and be surrendered if received in a foreign currency, within one month of the due date. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and Operations Account countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services, and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets, must be collected and, if received in foreign currency, be surrendered within two months of the due date. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of 162 bank notes and coin issued by the BEAC, the Bank of France, or any other bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) and other foreign means of payment. Foreign bank notes and coin in excess of the equivalent of CFAF 20,000 brought in by residents must be exchanged for CFA francs within eight days of their return. Capital Capital movements between Chad and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require exchange control approval and are restricted, but capital receipts from such coun- tries are permitted freely. All foreign securities, foreign currency, and titles embodying claims on foreign coun- tries or nonresidents that are held in Chad by residents or nonresidents must be deposited with authorized banks in Chad. Special controls (additional to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable or suspended insofar as they would be contrary to the exchange control regulations) are maintained over borrowing and lending abroad, over inward and outward direct investment, and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Chad; these controls relate to the transactions themselves, not to payments or receipts. With the exception of those controls over the sale or introduction of foreign securities in Chad, the measures do not apply to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries. Direct investments abroad2 require the prior approval of the Minister of Economy and Commerce, irrespective of the method of financing; the full or partial liquidation of such investments also requires the prior approval of the Minister. Foreign direct investments in Chad3 require the prior approval of the Minister of Economy and Commerce unless they take the form of a mixed- economy enterprise. The full or partial liquidation of direct investments in Chad must also be declared to the Minister. Both the making and the liquidation of direct investments, whether these are Chadian investments abroad or foreign investments in Chad, must be reported to the Minister within 20 days of each operation. Direct investments are defined as investments implying control of a company or enterprise. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Chad requires prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Commerce. Exempt from authorization, however, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Chadian Government, and (2) shares similar to securities whose 2 Including those made through foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in Chad and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Chad. 3Including those made by companies in Chad that are directly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or sub- sidiaries in Chad of foreign companies. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution issue, advertising, or offering for sale in Chad has previously been authorized. Borrowing abroad by physical or juridical persons, whether public or private persons, whose normal resi- dence or registered office is in Chad, or by branches or subsidiaries in Chad of juridical persons whose regis- tered office is abroad, requires prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Commerce. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans constituting a direct investment abroad for which prior approval has been obtained, as indicated above; (2) loans directly connected with the rendering of services abroad by the persons or firms mentioned above, or with the financing of commercial transactions either between Chad and countries abroad or between foreign countries in which these persons or firms take part; and (3) loans other than those mentioned above, when the total amount outstanding of the loan does not exceed CFAF 10 million for any one borrower, with an interest rate not higher than 7 percent and a maturity of two years or less. The contracting of loans referred to under (3) that are free of authorization, and each repayment thereon, must be declared to the Minister within 30 days of the operation. Lending abroad by physical or juridical persons, whether public or private persons, whose normal resi- dence or registered office is in Chad, or by branches or subsidiaries in Chad of juridical persons whose regis- tered office is abroad, requires prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Commerce. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans directly connected with the rendering of services abroad by the persons or firms mentioned above, or with the financing of commercial transactions either between Chad and countries abroad or between foreign countries in which these persons or firms take part; and (2) other loans, when the total amount outstanding of these loans does not exceed CFAF 5 million for any one lender. The making of loans referred to under (2) that are free of authorization, and each repayment thereon, must be declared to the Minister within 30 days of the operation. Commercial banks must maintain in Chad a specified minimum proportion of their assets. CHAD Under the Investment Code of August 26, 1963, any enterprise established in Chad, whether domestic or foreign, is granted, under certain conditions, reduced duties and taxes on specified imports, as well as exemption from direct taxes on specified income. The code also provides for three categories of preferential treatment, in accordance with which certain fiscal and other privileges may be accorded to firms investing in specified new industries or in the expansion of existing ones. Requests for preferential treatment must be sub- mitted to the Minister of Economy and Commerce, who, after examining the documents, transmits them to the Investment Commission. After an opinion has been given by that Commission, the project is submitted to the Council of Ministers. Gold Chad has issued gold coins with face values of CFAF 1,000, 3,000, 5,000, 10,000, and 20,000, which are legal tender. Residents who are not producers of gold may not hold unworked gold unless specifically autho- rized. Imports and exports of gold, whether unworked or refined, require prior authorization by the Office of the Minister of Economy and Commerce and by the Direc- torate of Energy, Mines, and Geology as well as the visa of the Foreign Trade Office. Exempt from this require- ment are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, and (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles). Exports of unworked gold and of raw diamonds (as well as domestic purchases and sales of both) are the monopoly of the Office for Purchases, Sales, Imports, and Exports (BAVTE), which is an approved private company. Unworked gold may be exported only to France. Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Changes During 1985 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 163 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CHILE (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement1 The currency of Chile is the Chilean Peso (Ch$). The official exchange rate of the Chilean peso is pegged to the U.S. dollar, at a rate adjusted at daily intervals according to a schedule established on the basis of the domestic rate of inflation during the previous month, less the estimated world rate of inflation. On December 31, 1985 the official exchange rate was Ch$180.22 per US$1. Foreign exchange dealers, the Banco del Estado, commercial banks, exchange houses, and other autho- rized entities must trade in foreign exchange within a band of 2 percent on either side of the official rate. The Central Bank only enters the foreign exchange market when either end of the band is reached. Direct transac- tions in foreign exchange among private parties can take place at freely negotiated exchange rates, provided that they are occasional and unpublicized. Commissions on exchange transactions are subject to a 20 percent value- added tax. The exchange rates of the Chilean peso with other currencies are determined on the basis of the peso exchange rate with respect to the U .S. dollar and of the U.S. dollar exchange rate with respect to other curren- cies quoted in foreign markets. Beginning from July 1, 1985, in a modification of existing special arrangements, and for a period sched- uled to terminate at the end of 1986, the Central Bank applies an exchange subsidy on service payments on external debt contracted before August 6, 1982. The following have access to the subsidy: (1) debtors to Chilean banks or financial companies whose debt is indexed to the official exchange rate; and (2) debtors with direct obligations abroad whose obligations were registered with the Central Bank. The subsidy is paid by means of notes with a maturity of between six and ten years, and bearing a 3 percent rate of interest. On December 31, 1985 the difference between the official rate and the subsidized rate was Ch$47.87 per US$1. Administration of Control The Executive Committee of the Central Bank is responsible for carrying out currency exchange policy. The Chilean Copper Commission is responsible for the supervision of copper exports and all imports of the copper industry; this supervision has to be exercised in accordance with general rules enacted by the Central Bank. Prescription of Currency Settlements with Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colom- bia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and 'With effect from January 1, 1986, the Government has authorized commercial banks to provide a market for foreign exchange options with a maturity of between 15 and 180 days. On maturity, contracts are settled in pesos on the basis of the difference between the market rate and the contract rate. 164 Venezuela must be made through accounts maintained with each other by the Central Bank of Chile and the central banks of each of the countries concerned, within the framework of the multilateral clearing system of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA). Set- tlements with the Dominican Republic must be made through clearing accounts established under a reciprocal credit agreement. Settlements with other countries take place in specified convertible currencies. Imports and Import Payments Most imports are free, with the exception of used motor vehicles. All imports require a document (known as Informe de Importation) issued by the Central Bank, which can be obtained and processed through the intermediary local commercial bank. Payment for visible trade transactions is not permitted unless an Informe de Importation has been issued. Since March 23, 1983 imports are subject to a 120-day minimum financing requirement. Importers may pur- chase spot exchange before the payment date and place a deposit in foreign exchange at the Central Bank in anticipation of payment. Imports on deferred payment terms (cobertura diferida), that is, on credit terms exceeding 360 days, require prior authorization of the credit terms by the Central Bank. Virtually all imports are subject to a registration tax of up to 3 percent of value, which is offset against the applicable import du ty. Since June 29, 1985 imports are subject to a uniform 20 percent tariff rate with some exceptions. Exceptions include tariffs bound under the GATT and tariffs negotiated with LAI A countries. Specific duties exist on imports of some dairy products, in particular powdered milk. In addition, tariff duties or surcharges are applied on imports of certain products that are subsidized in the country of origin. Payments for Invisibles Specified allowances exist for certain transactions; central bank authorization is required for others. The authorization is provided upon presentation of appropri- ate documentation. The established limit for tourist travel (in addition to the fares) is the equivalent of US$500 a trip for travel to Latin America and Caribbean countries and of US$1,500 a trip to other countries. For travel by land, 20 percent of the allowance is provided in the form of foreign exchange and the rest in money orders. Higher amounts for travel other than tourism may be authorized by the Central Bank of Chile, upon presentation of adequate justification. Residents may purchase up to US$200 a month for study abroad, subscriptions to magazines, books, and pension payments, subject to presentation of appropriate documents. Higher amounts may be authorized by the Central Bank of Chile, upon presentation of adequate ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution justification. Insurance activities within the country are limited to Chilean companies or to authorized foreign companies. Exports and Export Proceeds All commodities may be freely exported. All foreign exchange proceeds from exports in excess of US$ 1,000 must be surrendered through commercial banks, which are required to advise the Director of Operations of the Central Bank immediately (the Chilean Copper Commis- sion in the case of copper). Commercial banks are authorized to purchase all foreign exchange proceeds spot from exporters. Exporters are allowed to retain up to 5 percent of export proceeds in a special Foreign Exchange Account, but the cumulative deposits in any such account during a 12-month period may not exceed US$500,000. Receipts from exports of the large copper mines must be deposited in a special foreign currency account at the Central Bank. Export proceeds subject to surrender requirements must be repatriated within 90 days from the date of shipment and surrendered within 10 days from the date of repatriation; for specified goods this period may be extended. As a means of expediting the operation of the drawback system in respect of small export values, exporters of eligible items (approximately 6 percent of the country's annual exports), whose aVerage annual exports in 1983 and 1984 were less than US$2.5 million, have an option of taking a subsidy equal to 10 percent of the net export value of their sales (within an overall value not exceeding US$7.5 million), in lieu of benefits under the existing import duty drawback scheme; alternatively, such exporters may avail themselves of the provisions of Decree No. 409 under which they may draw back their payments of duties on imported inputs. Proceeds from Invisibles In general, foreign exchange proceeds from invisibles must be surrendered only when required by a legal provision. Such is the case for commissions, proceeds from insurance, and other benefits related to foreign trade. There are no similar rules concerning the proceeds from royalties and copyright fees, family remittances, and the surplus foreign exchange from travel allocations. Capital Capital inflows are generally free, but most outflows are restricted. All new foreign borrowing or refinancing of existing credits by commercial banks requires prior approval by the Central Bank, with the exception of the taking up of lines of credit of up to one-year maturity with foreign correspondents and short-term loans for domestic relending up to a limit determined mainly by a bank's capital and reserves. Foreign capital may enter Chile under one of the following arrangements, depend- ing on the purpose and type of the investment, as follows: CHILE (1) Article 14 of Decree No. 471 of October 17, 1977 stipulates, inter alia, that capital brought into the country in the form of foreign borrowing (creditos externos) must be sold through authorized banks when the investor (individual or corporate, national or foreign) has regis- tered the transaction with the Central Bank. There is no minimum term on the maturity of foreign borrowing. Repatriation normally is allowed only in accordance with the amortization schedule established at the time of registration. Accelerated payments or extensions of payment are subject to special authorization. (2) Article 15 of the same decree authorizes the Central Bank to make exemptions to the general rules enacted by it concerning the inflow and outflow of capital or credits. (3) Decree-Law No. 600 of July 7, 1974 (amended by Decree-Law No. 1748 of March 18, 1977), the Foreign Investment Statute, establishes a regime for long-term capital investment. Authorization to make a foreign exchange investment in Chile is granted by the Foreign Investment Committee through a contract containing undertakings regarding the phasing of the investment program that will normally not exceed eight years for mining and three years for other projects. Investments of less than US$5 million may be approved by the Execu- tive Secretary of the Committee, with a few exceptions. There are no limitations on profit remittances. Capital may be repatriated after three years. Foreign investors can opt for a guaranteed 49.5 percent a year total corporation income tax over a period of ten years, or may subject themselves to the tax system applicable to domestic corporations (currently 48.5 percent). Any foreign credits involved must be on terms authorized by the Central Bank. Foreign capital that entered Chile prior to the promulgation of Decree-Law No. 600 and that did not opt to be subject to that law continues to be subject to the regulations prevailing on the date of entry. Contract awards in the oil sector are decided by the Government under Presidential Decree; rights and responsibilities under such a Decree may be vested in the Empresa Nacional de Petroleo (ENAP) by the Ministry of Mines. (4) Chapters XVIII and XIX of the Chilean Compen- dium of Rules on International Exchange, as amended in May 1985, regulate the purchase of selected Chilean foreign debt instruments abroad at a discount, as well as their repatriation. Eligible instruments are defined as external debt payable in foreign currency outside Chile with a maturity of more than one year, the debtor of which may be either the Treasury, the Central Bank, a public sector entity, the Development Corporation (CORFO), a financial institution, or a private sector resident having a guarantee from a financial institution. Chapter IX governs the use of Chilean debt instruments by foreign residents for direct investment in Chile with remittance rights. Upon approval of the Central Bank, the foreign currency obligation is exchanged into a domestic currency obligation, the proceeds of which must be used for direct investment purposes, with the intermediation of a financial institution; special 165 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CHILE regulations apply to repatriation of such capital as well as to dividend payments. Chapter XVIII specifies the regulations for the conversion into peso assets (without remittance rights) by residents and nonresidents, of debt purchased at a discount abroad with foreign exchange not obtained in the official market; such assets may be used to settle direct domestic debt, third-party debt or be exchanged for equity and fixed assets of financial institutions.2 Transactions under Chapter XVIII are also channeled through financial institutions, subject to an overall quota assigned on the basis of an auction system. Gold Chile has issued three types of gold coin, which are not legal tender. Monetary gold may be traded only by authorized houses, but ordinary transactions in gold between private individuals may be freely undertaken. Imports and exports of gold are unrestricted, subject to compliance with the normal formalities for import and export transactions, including registration with the Cen- tral Bank. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement The official exchange rate was changed gradually in 1985 on the basis of the differential between domes- tic and estimated external inflation. In addition, the peso was depreciated against the dollar in two discrete steps, by 8.2 percent on February 27, and by 7.2 percent on June 29. Altogether, these actions involved an adjustment of the Chilean peso from Ch$127.80 = US$1 on December 31, 1984 to Ch$180.22 = US$1 on December 31, 1985, representing a depreciation of 29.1 percent. June 29. The intervention points of the Central Bank were changed from 0.5 percent to 2 percent on either side of the official rate. July 1. A schedule was announced, according to which the preferential dollar subsidy on the service pay- ments in respect of certain foreign currency-denominated debts each amounting to at least US$50,000 would be gradually phased out and eliminated by the end of 1986. Restrictions on the use of these assets were lifted in May 1986. Imports and Import Payments February 27. The uniform tariff rate was reduced from 35 percent to 30 percent. June 24. The uniform tariff rate was reduced from 30 percent to 20 percent. Payments for Invisibles December 11. The basic travel allowance was in- creased from US$200 to US$500 a trip for travel to Latin America and Caribbean countries, and from US$800 to US$1,500 a trip for travel to other countries. Exports and Export Receipts December 17. With retroactive effect from July 1, 1985, a law was introduced giving exporters of specified export products (sales of which did not exceed US$2.5 million in 1984) an option of a subsidy equal to 10 percent of the net value of their sales not exceeding an overall value of US$7.5 million, in lieu of benefits under the existing import duty drawback scheme. Capital May 14. Two schemes were introduced for the purchase of specified Chilean foreign debt instruments in secondary markets abroad and their conversion into domestic peso obligations. Under the first scheme (Article XIX of the Compendium on Rules on Interna- tional Exchange), nonresidents could use the debt instru- ment for direct investment in Chile. Upon approval of the Central Bank, the foreign currency obligation would be exchanged into domestic currency, which should be used for direct investment purposes, with the intermedia- tion of a financial institution; special regulations would apply to the repatriation of such capital as well as to dividend payments. Under the second scheme (Chap- ter XVIII), authorization was granted for residents and nonresidents to purchase selected debt instruments using foreign exchange not obtained in the official foreign exchange market, for conversion into pesos, without remittance rights. The peso assets could be used only to reduce domestic debt or to acquire specified assets owned by domestic banks. Transactions under Chap- ter XVIII would also be channeled through financial institutions, subject to an overall quota that would be assigned to the different institutions on the basis of an auction system. 166 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA (Position on December 3J, 1985) Exchange Arrangement1 The currency of the People's Republic of China is the Renminbi and its unit is the yuan. The exchange rate of the renminbi is adjusted in accordance with movements in the value of a basket of internationally traded currencies, weighted with reference to their importance in China's external transactions and the trends in their relative values. The yuan-U .S. dollar rate is calculated directly from the value of the basket, while rates for 19 other currencies2 are determined from the cross rates. The exchange rate is published on a daily basis by the State Administration of Exchange Control; on Decem- ber 31, 1985 the buying and selling rates were Y 3.1935 and Y 3.2095, respectively, per US$1. Published rates for currencies other than those that are important in China's international transactions are changed whenever the calculated rate diverges from the previously pub- lished rate by 1 percent; for the important currencies, such as the Hong Kong dollar and the Japanese yen, a smaller margin of 0.5 percent is applied. Settlement for all spot transactions is effected at the official exchange rate. Forward exchange rates are published for 15 curren- cies.3 China does not apply a systein of forward premiums and discounts but instead uses the spot rate plus a forward charge. Forward transactions are only permitted in connection with an underlying trade transac- tion. When banks sell renminbi forward, a charge is levied; when they buy, no charge is levied except for the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. Rates are given for one to six months; transactions can be renewed for a further six months, but not for longer than one year. Forward charges reflect interest rates and trends in international markets in the currencies concerned. Administration of Control The People's Bank of China exercises central bank functions and control over foreign exchange; and the State Administration of Exchange Control (SAEC), as a government institution under the leadership of the People's Bank of China, is responsible for implementing the exchange regulations and controlling all foreign exchange transactions in accordance with state policy. There are sub-bureaus in the provinces, main munici- 1 Beginning from January 1, 1986, the exchange arrangement was modified from a system of pegging to a basket of currencies to one of managed floating. 2Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Hong Kong dollars, Iranian rials, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Pakistan rupees, pounds sterling, Singapore dollars, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. 3Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Hong Kong dollars, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds ster- ling, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and U .S. dollars. palities, autonomous regions, and special economic zones. Other banks and financial institutions, including affiliates of nonresident banks, may handle designated transactions with the approval of the SAEC. The China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) is authorized to conduct transactions connected with investments of foreign capital in China. Individuals and financial institutions may hold foreign exchange but may not deal in it or conduct arbitrage operations. Special exchange control measures are applied to special eco- nomic zones, the 14 designated coastal cities, and border regions. Foreign exchange transactions are generally made in accordance with a foreign exchange plan. Those parts of the foreign exchange plan dealing with foreign trade, foreign loans, and China's external assistance program are prepared by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade (MOFERT); the foreign exchange budgets of other government departments are prepared by the Ministry of Finance. The SAEC draws up the section of the plan covering local and provincial non- trade transactions, receipts from overseas Chinese, and individual receipts. The overall foreign exchange plan is coordinated and balanced by the SAEC; after it has been reviewed and reconciled with other plans by the State Planning Commission, it is submitted to the State Council for approval. Following approval, the plan is sent back to the various localities and ministries for implementation. The SAEC and the Bank of China are responsible for supervising the implementation of the foreign exchange plan. In principle, the foreign exchange plan covers all transactions, including those with countries with which China maintains bilateral payments agreements.4 The annual plan is divided into quarterly plans, and, at the end of each quarter, the State Planning Commission reviews the implementation of the plan and determines whether corrections are necessary. That part of the foreign exchange plan dealing with trade is broken down by commodity. Unexpected events, such as changes in foreign trade policies, might necessitate a revision of the plan. Prescription of Currency Trade transactions with Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, and the U .S .S .R. are expressed in Swiss francs, and those with Cuba, in pounds sterling at the 4China maintains operative bilateral payments agreements w i th the following Fund members: Afghan is tan, Bangladesh, Guinea, Hungary, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Pakistan, Romania, and Sierra Leone.

In normal circumstances, im- balances emerging toward the end of each year are covered by increased deliveries of goods. Noncommer- cial transactions are settled on a current basis in convertible currencies, except for part of such transac- tions with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Romania and all the transactions with Cuba, which pass through the clearing account. Payments to and from countries with which China has bilateral payments agreements are made in currencies and in accordance with the procedures set forth in those agreements. In other cases, where there are no specific regulations prescribing the currencies to be used in transactions, they are determined by terms agreed under the respective contracts. Bilateral trade and payments agreements are of two kinds: Type A agreements are designed to ensure balanced trade and include, for each good itemized, quantitative commodity lists or foreign exchange quota lists for those commodities that cannot be expressed in quantitative terms; these lists are binding on both parties. Most arrangements are of this type. Type B agreements (those with the Islamic Republic of Iran and Sierra Leone) provide such binding itemized lists only for the principal goods traded by the parties and also include nonbinding lists of secondary goods. Nonresident and Foreign Currency Accounts Nonresidents5 in China for a short period may open nonresident accounts with the Bank of China. Joint ventures may also open foreign exchange accounts and use them to make payments abroad. With the permission of the Bank of China, foreign banks may hold convert- ible renminbi accounts in connection with commercial or noncommercial transactions. Renminbi may be pur- chased for such an account only on presentation of documentary evidence that the money will be used in the designated transaction. The Bank of China may check any use made of renminbi in such accounts. Foreign banks in Special Economic Zones may lend in foreign exchange and accept foreign currency deposits from joint venture companies. Individuals may open resident foreign currency ac- counts at the Bank of China and may withdraw funds from such accounts in the form of foreign currency. Imports and Exports All trade, both direct and indirect, with Israel, the Republic of Korea, and South Africa is prohibited. The primary responsibility for formulating foreign trade policies and ensuring the implementation of regula- tions and policy measures rests with the MOFERT, which also issues the licenses required for all imports and a large number of exports; following the reform in the exchange and trade system effected in early 1985, the 5Nonresidents include overseas Chinese and residents of foreign countries and of the Hong Kong and Macao regions. Foreign embassies are also included. 168 MOFERT no longer engages in direct foreign trade transactions on a trial basis and is no longer involved in the daily enterprise management of two trading corpora- tions. Foreign trade is conducted by national foreign trade corporations and other entities licensed by the MOFERT to conduct foreign trade; in addition, certain manufacturing companies are permitted to engage di- rectly in foreign trade, and some companies conduct foreign trade as agents on a commission basis. Exporters and importers can freely choose their agents; however, a limited number of essential import commodities continue to be handled by one of the 14 national foreign trade corporations. All enterprises, other than registered national foreign trade corporations, need a license from the local foreign trade bureau to engage in trade or hold foreign exchange. Part of the proceeds of certain exports may be retained in a foreign exchange quota account with the Bank of China. All other foreign exchange earnings from exports must be repatriated and surrendered to the Bank of China, unless specific exception is granted by the SAEC, and may not be used directly to offset import payments. Before using their holdings of foreign exchange, enter- prises other than the national foreign trade corporations must seek the approval of the SAEC. The Bank of China provides foreign exchange for imports on the basis of import licenses and approval by the SAEC. Residents may not pay ifor imports with local currency. Foreign trade is based on an annual foreign trade plan drawn up by the MOFERT in conjunction with the State Planning Commission. The former sends directives on the preparation of the plan to all foreign trade corpora- tions and to the foreign trade bureaus in the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, which, in turn, meet with other interested entities and prepare lists of needed imports and goods available for export. The plans prepared at the local level are coordinated and balanced by the MOFERT and the State Planning Commission at national foreign trade planning confer- ences. The State Council grants final approval to the foreign trade plan. Goods that can be produced domestically or for which adequate domestic substitutes are available are not included in the import plan. Priority is given in the import plan to goods that cannot be produced domes- tically in adequate quantities and those that are urgently needed by the State, especially for key projects. In the case of some goods that are not produced in adequate quantities but for which a good foreign market exists, part of the production may be allocated to export. Importation of goods previously exported from China requires special authorization. The import and export of weapons, ammunition and explosives, radio receivers and transmitters, Chinese currency, manuscripts, printed and recorded materials, and films that are deemed to be detrimental to Chinese political, economic, cultural, and moral interests are prohibited. In addition, imports of poisons, narcotic drugs, diseased animals, and plants are prohibited, as is the export of valuable cultural relics and ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution rare books, rare animals and plants, and precious metals and artifacts made from these metals. All imports and exports require prior inspection before the release by the General Administration of Customs. Exports of specified machine tools require a license from the State Adminis- tration for the Inspection of Import and Export Com- modities, as a means of quality control. The customs regulations in force are the Provisional Customs Law of the People's Republic of China and the Customs Import and Export Tariff of the People's Republic of China. The import tariff rates fall into two columns: minimum and general. The minimum applies to imports originating from countries with which China has concluded trade agreements containing reciprocal favorable tariff clauses;6 the general tariff applies to imports originating in countries with which China does not have such trade agreements. Import duties are generally levied on the c . i . f. value of goods. Under the general tariff, dutiable imports are subject to one of 17 rates ranging from 8 percent to 180 percent, while those under the minimum tariff are subject to one of 17 rates ranging from 3 percent to 150 percent. In addition to regular import duties, a regulatory import duty is applied to 15 selected products;7 the regu- latory duty ranges generally between 40 percent and 80 percent. Imports into Tibet from abroad are subject to a separate system of customs duties established by the People's Government of the Tibet Autonomous Region. The tariff, however, only applies to goods imported directly into Tibet for use there. It does not apply to imports of other provinces, municipalities, and autono- mous regions through Tibet, or to imports through Tibet by mail or brought in as part of the luggage carried by travelers; such imports are subject to the regular Chinese tariff. In addition to customs duties, a consolidated industrial and commercial tax (a turnover tax also applied to other commodities) is levied on imports in accordance with the list contained in the Draft Regulations of the Con- solidated Industrial and Commercial Tax of the People's Republic of China. Raw materials imported for further 6These countries are as follows (classified by geographical areas): (1) Africa: Benin, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sao Tom6 and Principe, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Tunisia, Zaire, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA processing are exempted from both customs duties and commercial taxes, provided that the products are all exported within a specified period. Most imports and exports by joint ventures are exempt from customs duties. Currently, 28 different commodities are subject to export duties. Localities and enterprises may retain part of foreign exchange earned from export (including net foreign exchange earnings in a compensation trade), in accor- dance with state regulations. The percentage of export earnings that can be retained varies with the enterprise. Special economic zones have been set up in Shantou, Shenzhen, Xiamen, and Zhuhai. Economic and technol- ogy development areas have been established in 14 designated coastal cities. Foreigners, overseas Chinese, and Chinese from the Hong Kong and Macao regions are permitted to invest in and open factories in these zones and areas. Raw materials, equipment, and machinery or parts and components thereof, means of transportation, and other means of production imported by and intended to be used in the production of the enterprises in the zones are exempt from import duties and the con- solidated industrial and commercial tax. Invisibles Enterprises must sell their foreign exchange earnings from invisibles to the Bank of China, except for the portion they may retain in accordance with specific regulations. Foreign exchange remitted from abroad or from the Hong Kong and Macao regions to Chinese residents may be retained and used to open an account in the Bank of China or an authorized bank. Similarly, foreign exchange owned by immigrants or returning Chinese before becoming residents may be retained. Such retained foreign exchange may be sold to the Bank of China or remitted through the Bank of China, or taken out of China against certification by the Bank of China. All foreign exchange earned by Chinese residents when working abroad, or in the Hong Kong or Macao regions, or earned from publication fees, copyright fees, awards, subsidies, honoraria, or other premiums, must be repatriated and may not be deposited abroad; but individuals may retain such earnings according to pre- vailing regulations. All the surrendered portion of foreign exchange remittances is accorded the privileged treatment given to remittances by overseas Chinese. Foreign staff members and employees of foreign joint ventures, as well as those from the Hong Kong and Macao regions,8 may remit their salaries and other income earned in China, after payment of taxes and deduction of their living expenses in China and approval by the relevant local authorities. Profits of joint ventures may be remitted after taxation, in accordance with foreign exchange regulations; such remittances are sub- ject to the approval of the local branch of the Bank of China and should be paid through the foreign exchange 8Including those employed by enterprises with overseas and foreign Chinese capital. 169 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA account of the joint venture. Remitted profits are subject to an additional tax of 10 percent, but only if the profits have been generated in areas other than the special economic zones and the economic and technological development areas in the 14 selected coastal cities. If a Chinese resident wishes to spend money on travel abroad, receive his pension abroad, or remit money abroad, he must apply to the local SAEC bureau for approval. Such factors as the individual's normal income and expenditure are examined to determine if approval is to be granted for remittances. In cases of serious illness, death, or injury affecting a Chinese resident's parents, spouse, or children outside China, he may be allocated the necessary foreign exchange on presentation of documentary verification. If permission is granted to travel abroad, a Chinese resident is normally allowed to take a reasonable amount of foreign exchange to cover expenses for transport and subsistence; any surplus must be repatriated and surrendered to the Bank of China. There is no tax on travel. A Chinese resident who retires and emigrates is normally permitted to receive his pension abroad, but he is not normally permitted to remit the proceeds from any assets he may sell in China. Foreign exchange remitted or brought in by nonresi- dents may be converted into either Chinese currency or foreign exchange certificates denominated in yuan. Foreign exchange certificates can be used solely by nonresidents in hotels, restaurants, and shops serving nonresidents, for purchasing airline tickets and through train or ship fares to Hong Kong and Macao, and for international telecommunications and parcel post charges. Special regulations apply in Guangdong prov- ince. Persons entering China must declare their holdings of foreign currency and may take out of China any unused foreign currency on presentation of the import declaration form issued by the customs. The import and export of Chinese bank notes are prohibited. Foreign exchange certificates may be imported, but their export is subject to the provision of documentation showing that they have been acquired legitimately. Chinese residents must show their authorization to export foreign currency at the border. Income from royalties, dividends, interest, and rentals earned by foreign businesses without establishments in China is subject to a 20 percent withholding tax; a preferential rate of 10 percent is applied for foreign and overseas Chinese partners in joint ventures set up in the special economic zones and the economic and technolog- ical development areas in the old urban areas of the 14 coastal cities. Joint ventures are required to be insured with Chinese insurance companies. Capital All foreign borrowing is subject to prior approval. All units wishing to borrow abroad must prepare a plan showing the kinds of imports for which the loan is intended. Such plans must indicate the total amount of foreign exchange needed and how much of it will be 170 earned and how much will be borrowed from abroad. All such plans are submitted to the State Planning Commis- sion, which reviews them in cooperation with the SAEC and the MOFERT. Loans for vital projects or projects that have a rapid rate of return are given priority approval. If the imports are for new construction, the plans are also reviewed by the State Economic Commission. Loans from international financial institutions and foreign governments require the sanction of the State Planning Commission and the approval of the State Council. Loans from international development agencies are generally the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance or the China Investment Bank (an organization under the direction of the Ministry); intergovernmental loans are the responsibility of the MOFERT. Govern- ment departments, local governments, and enterprises are usually required to borrow through the Bank of China or with its guarantee, rather than borrowing directly abroad themselves. The State Planning Commission sets an annual limit on such borrowing. Foreign borrowing in the form of deferred payments requires the approval of the MOFERT. Resident organizations may not issue securities for foreign exchange unless approved by the People's Bank of China. All foreign direct investment projects are in principle subject to the approval of the MOFERT. However, a number of provincial and local authorities have been granted the authority to approve foreign direct invest- ment projects up to specified amounts. The policy with respect to foreign capital is designed both to make up the insufficiency of domestic capital and to facilitate the introduction of modern technology and management. Most foreign exchange earned by joint ventures and other enterprises involving nonresident capital must be deposited with the Bank of China or another bank approved by the SAEC; outward transfers of capital generally require SAEC approval. Enterprises involved in the exploitation of offshore petroleum reserves may also hold foreign exchange abroad or in the Hong Kong or Macao regions. When a joint venture is wound up, the net claims belonging to the foreign investor may be remitted with SAEC approval through the foreign ex- change account of the joint venture. Alternatively, the foreign investor may apply for repayment of his paid-in capital. Profits of joint ventures, with the exception of firms in special economic zones and the 14 coastal cities, and those exploiting petroleum, natural gas, and other specified resources,9 are subject to tax at 33 percent (30 percent basic rate plus a 10 percent surcharge on the assessed tax). As mentioned above, remitted profits are subject to an additional tax of 10 percent, which is waived for joint ventures in the special economic zones and the economic and technological development areas 9The tax special rate for these firms is 15 percent. In addition, new joint ventures scheduled to operate for ten years or more may, inter alia, be exempted from taxation in the first and second profit-making years. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution of the 14 coastal cities. A joint venture scheduled to operate for ten years or more may be exempted from income tax in the first one or two profit-making years and be allowed reductions of 50 percent for the following three years. Joint ventures in low-profit operations, such as farming and forestry, or located in areas considered to be economically underdeveloped may, upon the ap- proval of the Ministry of Finance, be allowed a further 15-30 percent reduction in income tax for the following ten years. A participant in a joint venture that reinvests its share of profit in China for a period of not less than five years may obtain a refund of 40 percent of the tax paid on the reinvested profit. Certain joint ventures established before the passing of tax regulations in August 1980 are subject to taxes at different rates. Foreign companies, enterprises, and other econom- ic organizations that have establishments in China engaged in independent business operations, or coopera- tive production, or joint business operations with Chi- nese enterprises are subject to tax on their net income. There are five levels of tax rates, ranging from 20 percent for the first Y 250,000 of profits to 40 percent for profits exceeding Y 1 million. In addition, a local income tax of 10 percent of the same taxable income is levied. Income from interest on deposits of foreign banks in China's state banks and on loans from foreign banks to China's state banks with a normal interest rate is subject to a 20 percent withholding tax. Foreign state banks orig- inating in countries in which income froin interest on deposits and loans of China's state banks is exempted from income tax are correspondingly exempt from this Chinese tax. For interest income or leasing fees (less than the value of equipment) earned under credit agree- ments by foreign business without establishments in China, trade agreements, and leasing agreements signed by them with Chinese companies and enterprises during the period 1983-85, income tax is to be levied at the reduced rate of 10 percent (half of the normal rate) during the validity of the aforesaid agreements; interest earnings from export credits are entitled to income tax exemption. For fees collected by foreign businessmen for the use of special technology provided by them in such fields as agriculture, animal husbandry, research, energy, communications, transport, environmental pro- tection, and the development of important techniques, income tax may, upon the approval of the tax authorities, be levied at the reduced rate of 10 percent, or be waived if the technology is advanced and is provided on favorable terms. Foreign investment by Chinese enterprises is subject to approval; profits earned thereby must be sold to the Bank of China, except for a portion that may be retained locally as working balance. Chinese diplomatic and commercial organizations abroad, as well as businesses abroad and in the Hong Kong and Macao regions, are required to draw up annual foreign exchange plans. Gold The People's Bank of China buys and sells gold and has central control over dealings in gold and silver. Sales PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA of gold and silver are restricted to pharmaceutical, industrial, and approved uses. Private persons may hold gold but may not trade or deal in it. The amount of gold, gold products, silver, and silver products that may be imported is unlimited but must be declared on entry. When exporting gold or silver, the exporter must present an import document from the customs or a People's Bank of China export permit. Nonresidents may buy gold and silver and gold and silver products at special stores but must present the invoice when exporting them. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement January 1.

Not for Redistribution COLOMBIA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Colombia is the Colombian Peso. The Colombian authorities follow a policy of adjusting the peso in small amounts at relatively short intervals, taking into account (1) the movements of prices in Colombia relative to those in its major trading partners; (2) the level of Colombia's foreign exchange reserves; and (3) Colombia's overall balance of payments perfor- mance. Exchange surrender and foreign payments are generally effected through the medium of exchange certificates, which are traded in the official market at the official rate and in the stock exchange at varying rates of discount. In the case of export proceeds, exporters have the option of either immediate conversion or acquisition of exchange certificates with a maturity of 90 days. On December 31, 1985 the buy ing and selling rates in the official market for the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, were Col$172.20 and Col$172.89, respec- tively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates for certain other currencies1 are also officially quoted, with daily quotations based on the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar in markets abroad. All exchange transactions are effected through the Bank of the Republic (the central bank) or authorized banks. There are other effective exchange rates, which result from (1) a 6.5 percent tax on coffee export proceeds; (2) tax credit certificates granted at five different percent- age rates for most export proceeds; (3) the imposition of a remittance tax at two different rates on certain service payments; (4) an advance deposit of Col$65 per US$1 on the purchase of foreign exchange for travel purposes; and (5) a 95 percent advance exchange license deposit for import payments. The peso equivalent of the Govern- ment's exchange receipts from the export tax on coffee is credited to the Treasury's Special Exchange Account at an accounting rate applied by the Bank of the Republic; the Government purchases exchange for all public debt payments and other expenditures included in the national budget at the same exchange rate. The Bank of the Republic stands ready to sell exchange warrants (titulos canjeables por certificados de cambio) to government enterprises in the oil sector and to public sector recipients of external loans, against payment in pesos at the certificate market selling rate on the date of issue. These warrants, which are expressed in U.S. dollars and have a maturity of 24 months, are negotiable and may also be exchanged for exchange certificates, provided that the holder presents an ex- change license. Within their period of validity, warrants may also be sold to the Bank of the Republic for pesos at :1 1 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. the certificate market buy ing rate on the date of repur- chase. Warrants bear interest at 1.5 points above the New York prime rate, if held by government enterprises in the oil sector, or an interest rate equal to that of the external loan, but never higher than 11 percent or lower than 7 percent, if held by public sector recipients of external loans. Warrants held longer than 24 months cannot be converted into exchange certificates but may be resold to the Bank at the certificate market rate on the last day of the twenty-fourth month. Administration of Control All imports and exports require prior registration at the Colombian Institute of Foreign Trade (INCOMEX). Ex- change for payments must be purchased through the Bank of the Republic or the commercial banks, with an approved exchange license issued by the Exchange Office of the Bank of the Republic; however, payments for specified current transactions, when made through credit institutions, do not require prior exchange licenses but must be submitted to the Bank of the Republic for ex post authentication. All payments for study purposes require prior authorization by the Colombian Institute for International Education (ICETEX). The Monetary Board is authorized periodically to draw up a foreign exchange budget and it did so in 1985. It can also establish priorities w i th in that budget for the delivery of exchange, after setting aside the amounts necessary to cover the obligations of the Bank of the Republic and to service the external debt of the public agencies and the National Federation of Coffee Growers. The Foreign Trade Council (FTC), which includes representatives of the Ministry of Finance, INCOMEX, and other public entities, determines overall import and export policy and assigns foreign exchange for imports in the following order of priority: (1) raw materials and spare parts; (2) imports of El Cerrejon coal project; (3) public sector imports of agricultural products; (4) fuel imports; (5) capital goods imports for export industries; and (6) other imports. A joint Trade Commission (Comision Mixta de Comercio Exterior), with representatives from the Ministry of Finance, INCOMEX, and the private sector, serves as an advisory committee on foreign trade. INCOMEX, through its Import Board, controls those imports that are subject to prior licensing, administers special import-export arrangements in the form of barter, clearing, and triangular trade operations, and also sets maximum import prices for certain commodities. The National Council for Economic and Social Policy issues directives concerning direct investment in Colombia to the Ex- change Office and the National Planning Department. The Exchange Office keeps an accounting record both of foreign investment in Colombia and of debts abroad and controls the movement of foreign capital as well as the transfer of profits, dividends, commissions, and royalties 173 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution COLOMBIA for trademarks, patents, etc. The sale of proceeds from certain current invisibles is also subject to prior registra- tion with the Exchange Office. The Superintendency of Exchange Control, which is an autonomous agency reporting to the Presidency of the Republic, enforces the control and supervision over exchange transactions and is responsible for applying penalties for any violation of the exchange regulations. Prescription of Currency The Monetary Board establishes the list of currencies that it accepts for exchange surrender and provides for import payments. Payments and receipts are normally effected in U.S. dollars, but importers and exporters are also free to use quoted currencies (see footnote 1). Settlements for commercial transactions with countries with which Colombia has bilateral payments or recip- rocal credit agreements2 must be made through special accounts in accordance with the provisions of the particular bilateral payments agreement. Settlements between Colombia and Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela are made through accounts maintained within the framework of the multilateral clearing system of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA). There are also reciprocal credit agreements with Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Spain, the U .S .S .R ., and member countries of the Central American Common Market (CACM). Nonresident Accounts Credit institutions are authorized to receive short-term deposits in foreign currency from physical or juridical persons not resident in Colombia; these deposits are freely available to the holders, but any foreign currency deposits that they may wish to convert into Colombian currency must be sold to the Bank of the Republic. Before releasing the accounts of nonresidents, banks must obtain authorization from the Exchange Office. Imports and Import Payments Imports are subject to one of the following regimes: (1) freely importable goods, requiring only registration with INCOMEX; (2) goods subject to prior approval and requiring an import license; (3) goods included in the prohibited import list; and (4) goods requiring special import-export arrangements for their importation. In the free-import regime, there is a global free list applicable to all countries, a National List applicable only to member countries of the LAIA, and special lists applica- ble only to less-developed member countries of the LAIA and to members of the Andean Pact. Operations under special import-export arrangements in the form of barter, clearing, and triangular trade arrangements are required to take place in accordance with the relevant regulations issued by the Monetary Board in the event 2Colombia maintains bilateral payments agreements with Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia. 174 that they give rise to a request for foreign exchange or to an obligation to surrender foreign exchange. These arrangements involve payments in foreign currency in cases when the Colombian importer and the Colombian exporter are not the same juridical entity and, in addition, the import operation is not followed by the export operation contemplated in the arrangement be- cause of noncompliance on the part of the exporter. In such cases, INCOMEX designates a "responsible party," which is requested to provide the value of the import in pesos plus a peso-denominated fine. Similarly, the exporter participating in barter arrangements is requested to surrender the foreign exchange earned in the case when the export operation precedes the import operation and the importer fails to comply with the terms of the arrangement. INCOMEX encourages special import-export operations as a means to promote, through other foreign trade mechanisms, exports which would not be carried out otherwise. A distinction is drawn between reimbursable and nonreimbursable imports. The term reimbursable im- ports covers imports that involve purchase of official foreign exchange, including imports of machinery and equipment, financed by international credit institutions. Nonreimbursable imports consist mainly of aid imports under grants and commodities constituting part of a direct investment. All import registrations by public sector agencies are screened by INCOMEX to determine whether local substi- tutes are available. Import licenses for certain items are normally not issued; these include arms and habit- forming drugs, certain foodstuffs, certain textiles and clothing, and jewelry. Both import licenses and registra- tions are valid for six months, except for imports of agricultural and livestock products, for which the valid- ity period is three months. Import licenses can be extended for successive three-month periods, whereas registrations of free imports can be extended for only two successive three-month periods. All imports other than those classified as "minor imports" or shipments with an f .o .b. value of less than US$500 are subject to registra- tion with INCOMEX. Urgently needed spare parts not exceeding US$10,000 are also classified as minor im- ports and are not subject to registration. The charge for import registration is Col$ 1,500. An advance exchange license deposit (consignation) has to be lodged at the official rate for exchange certificates at least 20 calendar days prior to an application for an exchange license. The rate of deposit is 95 percent of the value of the exchange license. Import duties are calculated at the "Ministry of Finance exchange rate" (the average selling rate for exchange certificates for the previous month, as deter- mined by the Ministry of Finance). In addition to customs duties, there is an ad valorem tax on imports equal to 5 percent of the c . i . f. value, the proceeds of which go to the Export Promotion Fund. Exempt from this tax are temporary imports; imports by public entities; goods of LAIA origin; imports under the Vallejo ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Plan; diplomatic, consular, and similar imports; gifts; and imports destined for CORFERIAS (International Com- merce Fair of Bogota), for the free port of San Andres y Providencia, or effected through the Port of Leticia. With the above exemptions, imports are also subject to a tax of 1.5 percent of the c . i . f. value, the proceeds of which accrue to the ordinary budget of the National Government. All imports (except newsprint) are subject to a stamp tax of 1 percent of the f .o .b. value, as well as to a temporary surcharge of 8 percent. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles are made at the exchange certificate rate. To obtain exchange licenses for freight payments, a freight company mus t, either directly or through agents in Colombia, lodge a deposit amounting to 95 percent of payment value. Payments for more than 80 percent of total import or export freight are allowed only if it can be established that freight costs payable in local currency amounted to less than 20 percent of total cost. Services may be imported through special import- export arrangements in the form of baiter, clearing, and triangular trade arrangements. Most payments for invisibles, including banking commissions, international air travel, and expenses incurred in the export of noncoffee products, are subject to exchange licenses. Banks may transfer without prior approval payments for certain other current invisibles, including interest on suppliers' credit, medical expenses, support of technical staff abroad, the monthly allow- ances of students studying abroad with government support, and for the service of registered foreign loans taken up by the private sector. Foreign exchange purchases for foreign travel are limited to the equivalent of US$90 a day, up to US$1,500 a year, for those under 12 years of age; US$180 a day, up to US$3,000 a year, for an adult; and up to US$200 a day, within a limit of US$10,000 a year, for "special" travelers, defined as those traveling for reasons that are of particular useful- ness in the economic and social development of the country. In addition, a prior deposit of Col$65 per US$1 must be lodged with the Bank of the Republic, refund- able within six months upon submission of evidence of amounts actually spent, together with travel documents. Remittances abroad for study purposes are subject to the following limits: (1) US$300 for travel; (2) US$400 for books and study material; (3) US$400 to cover thesis fees; (4) up to US$500 monthly for living expenses; (5) up to US$250 monthly for expenses incurred by a spouse if course work extends beyond six months; and (6) a once-and-for-all US$500 allowance for unforeseen expenditures. Registration fees for courses approved by ICETEX, as well as health and accident insurance for students, are not subject to limits. Requests for foreign exchange for study purposes have to be approved by ICETEX. The transfer of profits accruing to foreign investors is limited to 20 percent of the capital base a year. Profits beyond such limit may count toward increasing the COLOMBIA capital base up to a yearly maximum of 7 percent of registered capital and only when at least 50 percent of the amount is reinvested in bonds issued by the Industrial Promotion Institute or in new enterprises satisfying the following criteria: (1) at least 80 percent of their production is exported; and (2) at least 40 percent of their financing is in the form of direct foreign investment and/ or foreign medium- and long-term loans. These limita- tions do not hold for multinational enterprises in which at least 80 percent of the capital is held by investors in the countries of the Andean Pact; in such cases, profits can be reinvested and transferred freely. Foreign tourists who have stayed in Colombia for a period not exceeding three months may, on leaving the country, purchase foreign currency of up to US$100 on presentation of their passports. A remittance tax of 12 percent is applicable to a number of current payments; for profits transferred by branches of foreign companies, the tax is 20 percent. Colombian nationals and resident foreigners are re- quired to pay a travel tax of US$15 whenever they leave the country. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of certain commodities are prohibited, and exports of certain foodstuffs are subject to quotas. Exports of certain other items, such as beef, are reserved for the Institute de Mercado Agropecuario (IDEMA). No export licenses are required, but prior application for registration is necessary for all exports except samples and Colombian products in noncommercial quantities. When registering an export transaction, exporters must provide INCOMEX with either a personal guarantee in pesos (but without depositing any funds) or a bank guarantee corresponding to 5 percent of the registered amount, calculated at the Ministry of Finance exchange rate. The periods for surrendering export proceeds are normally as follows: (1) for coffee, within 20 days from the date of registration of the export (180 days for instant coffee); and (2) for other goods, generally within five months of registration. However, longer time periods for the surrender of proceeds are permitted for exports to Chile, Peru, Ecuador, and Venezuela, goods sold on a commission basis; books, magazines, and other printed matter (18 months); capital goods (2 years); and other goods that normally require more extended payment terms. The Bank of the Republic is empowered in certain cases to retain a portion of the exchange proceeds surrendered by the exporter of any product to repay debts for imports under the Vallejo Plan. All exchange proceeds from exports must be surrendered to the Bank of the Republic, with the exception of export proceeds of the Empresa Colombiana de Petroleo (ECOPETROL) and exports of minerals associated with state enterprises, which are permitted to retain part of their export proceeds abroad for the settlement of their import costs. On surrendering their export proceeds to the Bank of the Republic, exporters of commodities other than 175 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution COLOMBIA coffee, raw cattle hides, or petroleum and petroleum products receive tax credit certificates (Certificados de Reembolso Tributario, or CERTs) in an amount corre- sponding to a specified percentage of the total earnings surrendered, converted at the Ministry of Finance ex- change rate. This rate ranges from 5 percent to 25 percent depending on the commodity and the country of destination; the rates are calculated on domestic value added for specified assembly operations. These certifi- cates, which are freely negotiable and are quoted on the stock exchange, are accepted at par by tax offices for the payment of income tax, customs duties, and sales taxes. The surrender of foreign currency earned by exporters can, as an option, be effected by exchanging the foreign currency for exchange certificates (of 90 days' maturity), which are negotiable on the stock exchange. Minimum surrender prices for coffee, bananas, and a few other exports are set from time to time by the Monetary Board. Exports of coffee are subject to the following regulations: (1) A minimum surrender price (reintegro) is fixed after deduction for freight and insurance at US$206.00 a 70-kilogram bag. (2) Export- ers pay a tax in foreign exchange at the rate of 6.5 percent ad valorem. Of this tax, 3.2 percentage points are paid to the National Coffee Fund, and 0.8 percentage point is paid to the Departmental Com- mittees of Coffee Growers; the remainder provides revenue for the Treasury's Special Exchange Account. (3) Exporters must either surrender without payment (in the form of untreated coffee) the equivalent of 68 percent of the volume of excelso coffee that they wish to export (retention cafetera) or pay the National Federation of Coffee Growers the peso equivalent. (4) Exports of coffee are subject to an additional tax of 6 percent ad valorem (pasilla y ripio tax); the tax must be paid to the Federation either in kind or in pesos. (5) A committee composed of the Ministers of Finance and Agriculture and the Managing Director of the Federation establishes a domestic buying price for export-type coffee, ex- pressed in pesos per cargo, of 125 kilograms. Proceeds from Invisibles All exchange receipts from invisibles must be surren- dered; they are converted against exchange certificates, which can be sold on the stock exchange. For surrenders in respect of gifts and the rendering of professional services other than medical, hospital, or educational services, prior authorization from the Exchange Office is required. Capital All inward and outward capital transfers are effected at the certificate market rate. There is a 95 percent advance payment deposit on all outflows, which must be lodged prior to an application for an exchange license. All foreign investment in Colombia, all new foreign loans, direct lines of foreign credit obtained by nonbank 176 residents,3 and the movement of capital previously imported (except loans previously registered under De- cree No. 2322 of September 2, 1965) must be registered with the Exchange Office. Direct foreign investment regulations in Colombia are in accordance with the provisions of Decisions Nos. 24 and 103 of the Cartagena Agreement, which govern foreign investment within the member countries of the Andean Pact. The National Council for Economic and Social Planning (CONPES) can legislate special conditions affecting foreign investment so as to overrule the above- mentioned provisions. Foreign investment is required to become 51 percent Colombian-owned by the fifteenth year after its registration, with the exception of invest- ment in enterprises that satisfy one of the following conditions: (i) at least 25 percent of their production is exported; or (ii) at least 50 percent of their material inputs are of Colombian origin. Member countries of the Andean Pact are treated as Colombian investors for purposes of fu l f i l l ing the Colombian ownership require- ment, provided that profit and capital remittances remain within the country of origin and shares are not sold outside the area. Capital invested in the petroleum industry is subject to special rules and provisions. Capital imports require prior approval by the National Planning Department, with the exception of capital for the petroleum industry, which requires approval by the Ministry of Mines and Energy, and capital for mineral exploration other than petroleum, which requires ap- proval by both the National Planning Department and the Ministry of Mines. All foreign banks and their branches must have Colombian majority participation. New foreign direct investment in banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions is restricted to investors from member countries of the Andean Pact and to national or mixed companies on the basis of reciprocal treatment. The purchase of 10 percent or more of the shares of a Colombian financial institution requires the prior approval of the Banking Superintendent. Capital registration entitles the investor to export profits and to repatriate capital at the certificate market rate on certain conditions specified in Decree No. 1900 of Septem- ber 15, 1973. The transfer of profits is limited to 20 percent of registered direct investment w i th certain exceptions (see section on Payments for Invisibles, above); where the profits were earned (and not remitted) prior to the coming into force of Decree Law No. 444 of 1967, the additional remittances must not exceed 3 percent a year. Special legal regimes exist for direct foreign invest- ment in the nickel, coal, and uran ium sectors, which waive the 20 percent limit on the transfer of profits abroad. A special regime also applies to a total of 3 Loans by financial entities for the import of goods also require registration; their repayment is authorized by the exchange license covering the relevant import transaction. Such loans are subject to an interest rate ceiling of 2.5 percent over the New York prime rate or the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR). ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 34 different industrial activities, including fishing, food products, leather products, chemicals, iron and steel, machine tools, engines, specialized machinery, ship- building, automobiles, the aeronautic industry, and photographic equipment, as well as enterprises exporting at least 50 percent of their output. This regime allows remittances in a percentage of dollar-denominated capi- tal determined by adding 20 points to the average New York prime interest rate prevailing in the year of registration of the foreign investment transaction, as estimated by the Bank of the Republic. Other special regimes are applicable to (1) the earthquake-hit area of Popayan, which allow profit remittances on invested capital in a percentage equivalent to 25 percent above the average New York prime interest rate in the year of registration of the capital inflows; and (2) bordering regions, which allow transfer of profits up to 24 percent of the dollar-denominated investment. Foreign loans contracted by private Colombian indi- viduals or firms are generally subject to a minimum maturity of three years with one year of grace and an interest rate ceiling of 2.5 percent over the New York prime rate or LIB OR. Such loans are normally permitted only for financing working capital or fixed investment. Special regulations govern the periods for which resident banks may provide import financing from foreign cur- rency borrowed abroad. Foreign loans for national or governmental entities in excess of Col$10 million or US$500,000 require prior authorization by the Ministry of Finance and the National Planning Department. For loans to the Government, or guaranteed by the Govern- ment, the following are also required: prior authorization by the National Council for Economic and Social Policy and by the Monetary Board, prior consultation with the Interparliamentary Committee on Public Credit, and ex post approval by the President of the Republic. Contracts involving royalties, commissions, trade- marks or patents, and similar arrangements must be registered with the Exchange Office to enable the beneficiary to make transfers abroad; they also require approval by the Royalties Committee before they can be registered. Colombian nationals who have invested abroad must surrender to the Bank of the Republic, against exchange certificates, not only the interest, profits, commissions, and royalties, but also the proceeds of the sale or liquidation of the investment. Export of capital by residents is restricted, and such export by private individuals is not normally permitted. Current deposit accounts in foreign currency may be held by insurance companies, export firms, transporta- tion companies, and other specified entities, upon prior authorization of the Bank of the Republic. A ceiling equivalent to 5 percent of their total foreign liabilities is applied on the foreign currency deposits that may be held by domestic financial institutions. Gold Natural and juridical persons may trade in Colombia in gold coins for numismatic purposes only. With this COLOMBIA exception, only the Bank of the Republic is entitled to purchase, sell, hold, import, or export gold. Imports of nonmonetary gold are not normally undertaken. The Bank of the Republic purchases locally produced gold at the average price prevailing in the London and Zurich markets during the preceding week, plus a subsidy of 30 percent on the indicated average price. The Bank of the Republic levies an ad valorem tax of 2 percent on the total payment received by the miner. The Bank of the Republic makes domestic sales of gold for industrial use directly at a price equivalent to the average quotation in gold markets abroad during the previous day; this price is converted into pesos at the prevailing selling rate of exchange certificates on the date of sale. The assay and refining houses and the mining compa- nies producing gold are under the supervision of the Superintendency of Exchange Control. In addition, the mining companies and traders must obtain a license from the Superintendency in order to carry on their operations. The Bank of the Republic from time to time strikes commemorative gold coins, which are legal tender. Residents and nonresidents may freely buy such coins, but export licenses are not normally granted. Changes During 1985 Imports and Import Payments February 27.

Changes were made as follows in regulations on surrender of export proceeds: (a) for exports of coal and ferronickel, 90 percent of the value indicated initially in the export registration should be surrendered within five months, and the balance within ten months from the date of approval of registration; and (b) with immediate effect, the time limit for the surrender of proceeds from various exports other than coffee would be calculated from the date of approval of the registration and would be defined as specified in Decision No. 74/84. July 17. The Bank of the Republic was authorized to process foreign exchange proceeds of CARBOCOL (the state enterprise for coal) from foreign loans against future exports of coal; and it was announced that exports financed with foreign exchange loans should be effected within five months from the loan receipt date. September 9. Exports of coffee during the crop year were required to be effected between October 1, 1985 and September 30, 1986; and coffee exports were required to take place within 60 calendar days from the date of registration of the sales contract with INCOMEX.

Not for Redistribution COMOROS (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Comoros is the Comorian Franc, which is pegged to the French franc, the interven- tion currency, at the fixed rate of CF 1 = F 0.02. The current buying and selling rates for the French franc are CF 50 = F 1. Exchange rates for other currenciesl are also officially quoted on the basis of the fixed rate of the Comorian franc for the French franc and the Paris exchange market rate for the respective currencies in terms of the French franc. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of those relating to gold, the exchange control measures of the Comoros do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Ter- ritories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose institute of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Congo, Cote d'lvoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Mali, Niger, Sene- gal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Central Bank of Comoros. The Ministry of Economy and Finance supervises borrowing and lending abroad, inward direct investment, and all outward investments. Part of the approval authority in respect of exchange control has been delegated to an authorized bank —the sole commer- cial bank —and to the Postal Administration. All ex- change transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through the authorized bank or the Postal Administration. Import and export licenses are issued by the Directorate-General of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Prescription of Currency The Central Bank of Comoros maintains an Opera- tions Account with the French Treasury; settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are made in Comorian francs, French francs, or the currency of any other Operations Account country. Settlements with all other countries are usually made through correspondent banks in France, in any of the currencies of those countries, or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. All settlements with South Africa are prohibited. Currencies quoted on the Paris official market: Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Djibouti francs, ECUs, Finnish markkaa, Greek drachmas, Irish pounds, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, U.S. dollars, and za'ires. 180 Imports and Import Payments Imports of South African origin are prohibited, and the import of certain other goods is prohibited from all countries. The import from any source of certain other commodities is subject to individual licensing. All import transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with the authorized bank if the value is CF 500,000 or more. Payments for Invisibles All payments to South Africa are prohibited. Pay- ments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are permitted freely. Those to other countries are subject to approval; with the exception of travel, for which there are maximum allocations, such approvals are generally given liberally. For tourist travel, residents traveling to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the other Operations Account countries, may take out the equivalent of CF 125,000 in bank notes and any amount in other means of payment. Residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may obtain up to CF 250,000 in foreign currency a person a trip. The maximum that may be allocated in bank notes is CF 125,000; the remainder may be in the form of a bank transfer, traveler's checks, a certified check, or any other means of payment. For business travel, a special allocation may be authorized by the Central Bank of Comoros upon the request of the authorized bank. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. With a few exceptions, exports to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are free of license. Most exports to other countries require licenses. Proceeds from exports to foreign countries must normally be collected, and the receipts repatriated within 30 days of the expiration of the commercial contract and sold immediately to the authorized bank. All export transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with the authorized bank if the value is CF 500,000 or more. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be collected and, if received in foreign currency, be surrendered within one month of the due date or the date of receipt. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution COMOROS in any amount of domestic and foreign bank notes and coin. Capital All settlements between the Comoros and South Africa are prohibited. Capital movements between the Comoros and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are, in principle, free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other coun- tries require exchange control approval, but capital receipts from such countries normally are permitted freely. Special controls (additional to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable) are maintained over borrowing abroad, inward direct investment, and all outward investment; these controls relate to the transac- tions themselves, not to payments or receipts. Gold Imports and exports of monetary gold require prior authorization. Imports and exports of articles containing gold are subject to declaration, but transfers of personal jewelry within the limit of 500 grams a person are exempt from such declaration. Changes During 1985 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 181 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency, of the People's Republic of the Congo is the CFA Franc,l which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. Exchange transactions in French francs between the BEAC and commercial banks take place at the rate of CFAF 50 = F 1. Buying and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also officially posted, with quotations based on the fixed rate for the French franc and the rates for the currencies concerned in the Paris exchange market. Payments to France and its Overseas Departments and Territories, Monaco, and the Operations Account coun- tries (see section on Administration of Control, below), as well as the purchase of those countries' bank notes and traveler's checks, are subject to a commission of 0.75 percent, with a minimum charge of CFAF 75; exempt from this commission are payments of the State, the Postal Administration, and the BEAC, salaries of Congolese diplomats abroad, expenditures of official missions abroad, scholarships of persons studying or training abroad, and debt service payments due from companies that have entered into an agreement with the Congo. Most payments to other foreign countries and credits to Foreign Accounts in Francs are subject to a commission of 1 percent or, for foreign exchange purchased by the Diamond Purchase Office, 0.50 per- cent; these commissions are subject to a minimum of CFAF 100. A commission of 0.25 percent is levied on all capital transfers to countries that are not members of the BEAC. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Payments to the following countries, although subject to declaration, are unrestricted: (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, Cote d'lvoire, Gabon, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Settlements and investment transac- tions with all foreign countries, however, are subject to control. Foreign countries are defined as all countries other than the Congo. The General Directorate of Credit and Financial Relations in the Ministry of Finance supervises borrow- ing and lending abroad. Exchange control is adminis- tered by the Minister of Finance, who has delegated his approval authority to the General Directorate. All ex- change transactions must be effected through authorized 'The CFA franc circulating in the Congo is issued by the Banque des Etats de 1'Afrique Centrale (BEAC) and is legal tender also in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, and Gabon. 182 banks or the Postal Administration. Import and export licenses are issued by the Foreign Trade Directorate in the Ministry of Commerce. Prescription of Currency Since the Congo is an Operations Account country, settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury. Settlements with all other countries are usually made in any of the currencies of those countries or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. The crediting of BEAC bank notes to Foreign Accounts in Francs is permitted when they have been mailed to the BEAC agency in Brazzaville by the foreign correspondent of an autho- rized bank. Imports and Import Payments Imports from all sources require prior authorization. There is an indicative annual import program which distinguishes five zones: (1) the countries of the Central African Customs and Economic Union (UDEAC); (2) France; (3) other countries of the French Franc Area; (4) EC countries other than France; and (5) all remain- ing countries. All imports under this program require licenses. The quotas for non-EC countries may be used to import goods originating in any country outside the French Franc Area. All import transactions relating to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Licenses for imports from countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Licenses for imports from countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries require the visa of the Foreign Trade Directorate and the General Directorate of Credit and Financial Relations. The approved import license entitles importers to purchase the necessary exchange, provided that the shipping documents are submitted to an autho- rized bank. All imports must be insured with the state insurance company, Societe d'Assurances et de Reassurances du Congo (SARC). To implement this measure, the Con- golese Customs Service releases imports only after an insurance certificate issued by the SARC has been produced. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution There has been some accumulation of arrears on external payments owing to the imposition of statutory ceilings on central bank credit to the Government and an ensuing shortage of domestic currency with which to purchase foreign exchange. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are permitted freely, provided they have been declared and are made through an authorized intermediary; those to other foreign countries are subject to approval. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are permitted with the authorization of the General Directorate of Credit and Financial Relations. Residents traveling as tourists to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, the Operations Account countries, or Zaire may obtain an exchange allocation of an amount equivalent to CFAF 175,000 a person a trip (CFAF 87,500 for children under 10 years) or CFAF 10,000 if the duration of the trip is less than 24 hours, for any number of trips a year; any foreign exchange in excess of CFAF 5,000 remaining after return to the Congo must be surrendered. For business travel, there is a special allocation of the equivalent of CFAF 20,000 a person a day, subject to a maximum of CFAF 400,000 a trip; additional amounts may be authorized in appropriate cases. The use of credit cards abroad by residents is prohibited. There are special facilities for travelers to Kinshasa who request no foreign means of payment other than Zai'rian bank notes. Residents traveling to France (as defined above), Mon- aco, or an Operations Account country may take out CFAF 25,000 (CFAF 12,500 for children under 10 years) in BEAC bank notes. Residents and nonresi- dents traveling to foreign countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, the Operations Account coun- tries, or Zaire may freely take out up to a maximum of CFAF 10,000 in BEAC bank notes, French bank notes, and bank notes issued by any other institute of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury. The transfer of the entire net salary of a foreigner working in the Congo is permitted upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher, provided that the transfer takes place within three months of the pay period. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports require prior authorization. Most exports to countries in the French Franc Area may be made freely; among the exceptions are commodities exported by the National Marketing Office for Agricultural Prod- ucts (Office National de Commercialisation des Produits Agricoles) and by the National Marketing Office for Timber (Office Congolais du Bois). PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO Proceeds from exports to foreign countries must be collected and repatriated, generally within 180 days of arrival of the commodities at their destination. Export proceeds must be surrendered within a month of the due date. All export transactions relating to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Proceeds from Invisibles All amounts due from residents of foreign countries in respect of services and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be collected when due and surrendered within a month of the due date. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BEAC, the Bank of France, or any other bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin). Capital Capital movements between the Congo and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are free, though ex post declarations are required. Such movements to countries that are not members of the BEAC are subject to a commission of 0.25 percent. Most international capital transactions are subject to prior authorization. Capital transfers abroad require exchange control approval and are restricted, but capital receipts from abroad generally are permitted freely. All foreign securities, foreign currency, and titles embodying claims on foreign countries or nonresidents that are held in the Congo by residents or nonresidents must be deposited with authorized banks in the Congo. Special controls (additional to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable) are maintained over borrowing and lending abroad, over inward and outward direct investment, and over the issuing, adver- tising, and offering for sale of foreign securities in the Congo; these controls relate to the transactions them- selves, not to payments or receipts. Direct investments abroad2 require the prior approval of the Minister of Finance; the full or partial liquidation of such investments also requires the prior approval of the Minister. Foreign direct investments in the Congo3 require prior approval by the Minister of Finance, unless they involve the creation of a mixed-economy enterprise. The full or partial liquidation of direct investments in the Congo must be declared to the Minister. Both the making and the liquidation of direct investments, whether these are Congolese investments abroad or foreign investments in the Congo, must be reported to 2Including those made through foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in the Congo and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in the Congo. 3Including those involving the transfer, between nonresidents, of funds in the form of participation in the capital of a Congolese company. 183 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO the Minister within 20 days. Direct investments are defined as investments implying control of a company or enterprise. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in the Congo requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. Exempt from authorization, however, are operations in connection with (1) borrow- ing backed by a guarantee from the Congolese Govern- ment, and (2) shares similar to securities whose issue, advertising, or offering for sale in the Congo has already been authorized. Borrowing by residents from nonresidents requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. However, loans contracted by registered banks and small loans, where the total amount outstanding does not exceed CFAF 10 million for any one borrower, are exempt from this requirement. The contracting of loans that are free of authorization, and each repayment thereon, must be reported to the General Directorate of Credit and Financial Relations within 20 days of the operation. Lending by residents to nonresidents is subject to exchange control, and all lending in CFA francs to nonresidents is prohibited, unless special authorization is obtained from the Minister of Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans in foreign currencies granted by registered banks; (2) other loans in foreign currencies when the total amount outstanding of these loans does not exceed the equivalent of CFAF 5 million for any one lender; and (3) foreign currency loans whose interest rate does not exceed 5 percent a year and whose maturity is two years or less. The making of loans that are free of authoriza- tion, and each repayment thereon, must be reported to the General Directorate of Credit and Financial Relations within 20 days. Under the Investment Code of April 26, 1973, a number of privileges may be granted to approved foreign investments. The Code provides for four categories of preferential treatment. Gold By virtue of Decree No. 66/236 of July 29, 1966, as amended by Decree No. 66/265 of August 29, 1966, residents are free to hold gold in the form of coin, art objects, or jewelry; however, to hold gold in any other form or to import or export gold in any form, from or to any other country, the prior authorization of the Minister of Finance is required. Exempt from the latter require- ment are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the Treasury or the BE AC, and (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles). Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. There are no official exports of gold. Changes During 1985 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 184 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution COSTA RICA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Costa Rica is the Costa Rican Colon. Costa Rica follows a flexible exchange rate system under which the exchange rate is adjusted from time to time, taking into account relative rates of inflation between Costa Rica and its trading partners and balance of payments developments. All transactions take place at the unified exchange rate. On December 31, 1985 the unified (or banking) rate was (£ 53.45 = US$1 buying and <£ 53.95 = US$1 selling. Export proceeds are converted at a mixed exchange rate composed of 0.2 percent at the official rate of <£ 20 = US$1 and 99.8 percent at the banking rate. The spread between the buying and selling rates in the banking exchange market is legally set at (£ 0.50. Purchases and sales of other Central American currencies are effected on the basis of quotations in colones, taking into account the value of those currencies in terms of U .S. dollars in the parallel exchange markets of the respective countries. Costa Rica formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agree- ment, as from February 1, 1965. Administration of Control Exchange controls are operated by the Central Bank. The only institutions authorized to deal with foreign exchange transactions are the Central Bank of Costa Rica, the state commercial banks, and certain private banks authorized by the Central Bank. Prescription of Currency In practice, nearly all exchange transactions in Costa Rica are expressed in U .S. dollars. Beginning from May 20, 1985, settlements in respect of all trade with Central American countries are required to be made in U.S. dollars. Payments to and from Colombia in respect of commercial operations, services, and capital may be made in U .S. dollars through a reciprocal credit arrange- ment between the member central banks of the Central American Clearing House and the Bank of the Republic of Colombia. Payments to Mexico in respect of trade, invisibles, and capital may also be made in U .S. dollars under an agreement between the member central banks of the Central American Clearing House and the Bank of Mexico. Imports and Import Payments There is no import licensing, and all import payments may be made freely, subject to submission of evidence of prior registration (see below), except for goods originating in the Central American Common Market (CACM) countries or Panama. Imports made on a barter basis require a barter license (licencia de trueque) issued by the Ministry of Economy and Commerce. To be eligible for foreign exchange, orders for imports valued at over US$500 must be registered with the Central Bank upon confirmation by the foreign supplier, unless the goods originate in CACM countries or Panama. Imports from South Africa are prohibited. In addition to any applicable customs du ty, the following taxes are levied on imports: (1) a stamp tax of 3 percent of the customs duty; (2) a sales tax of 10 percent ad valorem, from which certain essential items are exempt; and (3) a selective consumption tax at rates of 10 percent, 12 percent, 50 percent, and 75 per- cent, depending on the considered degree of essentiality. In addition, other levies are imposed as follows: a 2 percent surcharge on capital and consumer goods originating in Central America and Panama, as well as on construction materials; a 10 percent surcharge on non- agricultural capital goods for use by firms not generating a positive net effect on the balance of payments, vehicles with a load capacity exceeding two tons, and specified cabs with a load capacity of one ton or more; a 12.5 percent surcharge for consumer goods originating outside Central America; a 100 percent surcharge on vehicles with an engine displacement capacity not over 1,250 cubic centimeters, and a 200 percent surcharge on vehicles with engine capacities of over 1,250 cubic centimeters. There is also a small consular tax on certain imports. Under the provisions of the Central American Agree- ment on Fiscal incentives, Costa Rica grants duty exonerations on imports of raw materials and capital goods to approved industrial firms. Payments for Invisibles Withholding taxes of 15 percent and 10 percent, respectively, are levied on remittances abroad of divi- dends and interest; interest on certain borrowing abroad (e .g ., from government banks) is exempt. Costa Rican nationals and resident foreigners traveling abroad by air, sea, or land must pay a travel exit tax in colones equivalent to US$10; Costa Rican nationals who reside abroad must pay, in addition, a consular fee of US$20 upon renewal of their passports abroad. For residents covered by Law No. 4812 (pensionados rentistas) and residents not so covered, the payment differs from the national one. Costa Rican diplomats and certain Peace Corps officials pay an exit fee of only (£ 6, provided their passport states that they are exempt from the above charges. Civil servants and students are not exempt from these payments unless so determined by the Ministry of Finance or the Migration Council. Costa Rican minors are subject to all the above payments, except for dependents of diplomatic parents, who pay only the <£ 6 exit fee. Commercial banks dealing in the unified market may sell foreign exchange —without prior authorization of the 185 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution COSTA RICA Central Bank —in the following amounts: (1) for foreign travel, a limit of US$100 a day up to a maximum of US$800 a traveler (upon presentation of passport and travel tickets, commercial banks are authorized to sell the equivalent of this amount in the currency of a Central American country to travelers to Central American countries other than Panama); (2) for family remittances, up to US$500 a month a person to a maximum of US$1,000 a family; and (3) for unregistered students, a maximum of US$500 a month for living expenses, in addition to tuition, textbooks, and insurance, upon pres- entation of documents. Remittances to students pursuing higher education abroad are not eligible in the official market. Subject to approval by the Central Bank, these limits may be exceeded where justified by evidence of bona fide current expenditures for the specified purpose. Prior authorization by the Central Bank is also required for any foreign exchange purchases for the servicing of private foreign debt, foreign payment of dividends, royalties, patent rights, and professional services. Exports and Export Proceeds The Central Bank supervises exports to ensure that exchange proceeds are surrendered to the banking system; the latter sell to the Central Bank all of their purchases. Exporters of nontraditional commodities to markets outside Central America are entitled to receive tax credit certificates (CATs, which are freely negoti- able) for 15 percent of the f .o .b. value in the case of exports to the United States and Puerto Rico, and for 20 percent for other destinations outside Central America. In addition, exporters of nontraditional com- modities eligible for CATs may also receive certificates for increases in exports (CIEX) for 1-10 percent of the increase in the f.o.b. value of exports over the preceding calendar year; the certificates are redeemable against cash at the Central Bank. Licenses from the Central Bank are necessary for the exportation of merchandise. Exports to Nicaragua must be on the basis of advance payment in U.S. dollars, barter arrangement, or letters of credit confirmed by a major international bank. In addition to the export license from the Central Bank, other export licenses are required as follows: strategic materials, such as arma- ments, munitions, scrap iron, and scrap of nonferrous base metals (from the Ministry of Economy and Com- merce); sugar (from the Agricultural Industrial Board for Sugarcane); beans, rice, potatoes, onions, cotton, meat, and purebred cattle (from the National Council of Production); airplanes (from the Civil Aviation Board and the Ministry of Economy and Commerce); Indian art objects made of gold, stone, or clay (from the National Museum); tobacco (from the Tobacco Defense Board); lumber, root of ipecacuanha, certain livestock, and animals and plants of forest origin (from the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock); and coffee (from the Coffee Office); in addition, when there is a lien on coffee in favor of a bank, that bank's approval is required before the Central Bank grants an export license. Exports to South Africa are prohibited. 186 The exchange proceeds from coffee, bananas, sugar, beef, bovine cattle, and other perishable items must be surrendered within 30 days of shipment; within 90 days of shipment for exports of other agricultural goods as well as industrial goods; and within 180 days of shipment for capital goods. Foreign-owned banana com- panies that have contracts with the Government must surrender their net export proceeds, which are calculated by deducting from their gross export proceeds (1) profits obtained during the year from their transactions in Costa Rica; (2) the allowance for depreciation on their invest- ment in Costa Rica that is acceptable to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service; (3) the export tax on bananas payable in foreign currency; and (4) the cost of imports made during the year that were necessary for their normal business in Costa Rica. There are no taxes on nontradi- tional exports to countries outside of the Central Ameri- can Area and Panama; traditional exports do pay tax, in some cases graduated in line with the international prices. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles are free from controls or restrictions, but receipts from invisibles must be sold to the Central Bank or other authorized institutions. Capital All capital transfers between residents and nonresi- dents may be made, subject to prior authorization by the Central Bank. Capital received by the private sector may be registered at the Central Bank of Costa Rica, provided that it meets various requirements, including the require- ments that (1) the project financed with the funds has (or will eventually have), directly or indirectly, a positive effect on Costa Rica's balance of payments; (2) the amount of the capital is not less than US$5,000; and (3) the individual concerned sells the foreign exchange to the Central Bank. The registration guarantees the indi- vidual that the Central Bank will sell to him the exchange required to service the debt at the exchange rate in force at the time the servicing is effected. The National Budget Authorityl is in charge of authorizing the negotiation of new external credits contemplated by the Central Gov- ernment, decentralized agencies, and state enterprises. Foreign and domestic capital transferred from abroad may be deposited as time deposits in U .S. dollars with agent banks in the form of specified foreign currencies or be invested in certificates of deposit denominated in colones; such funds, when they mature, are repaid in the currency in which the deposits were made. Gold The Central Bank may purchase, sell, or hold gold coin or bars as part of the monetary reserves in freely, at home or abroad, domestically produced gold (except national archaeological treasures), provided there is no infraction of international agreements.

Law No. 6999 was issued, requiring all exchange transactions to be effected at the interbank exchange rate. Prescription of Currency April 11. The clearing arrangement with Mexico was suspended. Exports and Export Proceeds September 19. The prevailing rate of tax credit certifi- cates (CATs) was changed from a uniform basis of 15 percent of the f.o.b. value of exports to 15 percent for exports to the United States and Puerto Rico, and 20 percent for exports to other destinations outside Central America. 187 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution COTE D'lVOIRE (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Cote d'lvoire is the CFA Franc,1 which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. The official buying and selling rates are CFAF 50 = F 1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market and the fixed rate between the French franc and the CFA franc. The BCEAO levies a commission of 0.10 per mill on transfers from countries outside the West African Monetary Union, and one of 2.50 per mill on transfers to such countries.2 Banks and the postal system also levy a commission on transfers to all countries outside the West African Monetary Union, part of which must be surrendered to the Treasury. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of measures relating to gold and the repatriation of export proceeds, the exchange control measures of Cote d'lvoire do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Directorate of External Finance and Credit in the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The BCEAO is authorized to collect any information necessary to compile the balance of pay- ments statistics, either directly or through the banks, other financial institutions, the Postal Administration, and notaries public. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through authorized banks or the Postal Administration. Import and export licenses are issued by the Directorate of External Trade in the Ministry of Commerce. Prescription of Currency Since Cote d'lvoire is an Operations Account country, settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other Operations Account country. Current payments to or from The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, 'The CFA franc is issued by the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de 1'Ouest (BCEAO) and is the common currency in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'lvoire, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo. 2Transfers between member countries of the Union are subject to the flat commission of CFAF 100 levied on settlements between agencies of the BCEAO. 188 Liberia, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are normally made through the West African Clearing House. Settlements with all other countries are usually effected through correspondent banks in France, in any of the currencies of those countries, or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. BCEAO bank notes may be credited to Foreign Accounts in Francs when they have been mailed to the BCEAO agency in Abidjan by authorized banks' foreign correspondents. Otherwise, the crediting to nonresident accounts of BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, or bank notes issued by any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury is prohibited. Foreign Accounts in Francs may be debited, without prior authorization, with the value of BCEAO bank notes that are mailed by authorized intermediaries to their foreign correspondents. Imports and Import Payments Imports from South Africa are prohibited. Under a decree that came into force on January 1, 1982, all imports are classified into four categories, as follows: (a) prohibited imports (e .g ., wheat flour, and used garments); (b) import items (e.g., paints, matches, detergents, man-made fabrics, articles of leather, foot- wear, and carpets) for which import licenses are obligatory for each import transaction exceeding CFAF 25,000, f .o .b .; (c) import items requiring a declaration of intent to import; and (d) import items requiring both prior authorization and a declaration of intent to import; in the last two cases, (c) and (d), the requirements apply only to individual transactions ex- ceeding CFAF 100,000, f .o .b ., or CFAF 500,000 for goods considered essential. As noted below, certain other import items are subject to annual volume or value quotas. Imports of rice depend on domestic production, since they are intended as a supplementary means of satisfying domestic demand; such imports take place on the basis of an international invitation to bid or a government-to-government contract. All other imports may be made freely from any country; however, as mentioned above, when valued f .o .b. at CFAF 100,000 or more they are subject to the submission of a declaration of intent to import or to prior authorization, and when the f .o .b. value exceeds CFAF 1.5 million or more they are subject to mandatory preshipment inspec- tion by the Societe Generate de Surveillance (SGS), in order to control their price, quantity, and quality. Tariffs have been raised with a view to harmonizing effective protection of local production; in the case of some goods quotas have been replaced by temporary surcharges ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution scheduled to decline progressively during a five-year period. Imports from member countries of the West African Economic Community (WAEC) and of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) are exempt from the surcharge. All import operations relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value exceeds CFAF 500,000; transactions of lower value also must be domiciled with an authorized bank if a financial transaction is to be undertaken before customs clearance. The import licenses or import attestations entitle importers to purchase the necessary exchange, but not earlier than eight days before shipment, if a docu- mentary credit is opened, or only on the due date of payment, if the commodities have already been im- ported. Effective June 15, 1981, foreign exchange for import payments must be purchased either on the settlement date specified in the commercial contract or at the time when the required downpayment is made. Spot foreign exchange cover is limited to imports effected by means of documentary credits; the transaction must be domiciled with an authorized intermediary, and ship- ment of goods must be within eight days of the exchange operation. Forward exchange cover for imports in eligible cases must not extend beyond one month for certain clearly specified goods and three months for goods designated as essential commodities; no renewal of cover is possible. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to approval. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Trans- fers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted freely when the basic transaction has been approved. Any resident may make payments abroad freely, at any time, through an authorized bank, up to the equivalent of CFAF 50,000 a month without submitting any documentation. Residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may obtain an exchange allocation for tourism of an amount equivalent to CFAF 175,000 a person a year (CFAF 87,500 for children under ten). For business travel a special foreign exchange allocation is autho- rized up to a maximum of CFAF 20,000 a day and CFAF 400,000 a trip. Any foreign exchange remaining in excess of CFAF 5,000 after return to Cote d'lvoire must be surrendered. The transfer of the full basic salary of a foreigner working in Cote d'lvoire is permitted upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher, provided that the transfer takes place within three months of the pay period. Resident and nonresident travelers to foreign COTE D'lVOIRE countries may take out BCEAO bank notes up to CFAF 25,000. Travelers to other countries of the French Franc Area may take out any amount in BCEAO bank notes; however, if they travel to a country that is not a member of the West African Monetary Union (WAMU), the amount taken out must be declared to the customs if it exceeds CFAF 150,000. Nonresident travelers to foreign countries may freely take out foreign bank notes and coin up to the equivalent of CFAF 175,000, as well as any traveler's checks, etc., issued abroad. Subject to documentation, they may also take out any amount of traveler's checks, etc., in foreign currency established in their name after conversion of foreign currency into CFA francs, or drawn against a Foreign Account in Francs, or in a foreign currency in Cote d'lvoire. Nonresidents who have made a currency declaration upon entry or are able to show the proper banking notices may take out larger amounts. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. Most exports are free of license and require a declaration only. Exports of certain processed and unprocessed agricul- tural commodities, however, require the visa of the Directorate of External Trade. An export premium is applied on the basis of the domestic value added in locally manufactured products. Export taxes are waived for products receiving the premium, and products covered by taxation agreements under the WAEC are not eligible for the premium. The due date for payment in respect of exports to foreign countries, including those in the French Franc Area, must not be later than 180 days after the arrival of the goods at their destination. Regardless of the currency of settlement and the buying country, export receipts must be collected and repatri- ated through authorized intermediary banks within one month of the due date. Regardless of destination, all export transactions must be domiciled with an authorized bank when valued at more than CFAF 500,000. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services, and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be collected and surrendered within two months of the due date or the date of receipt. Resident and nonresident travelers may import any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BCEAO, the Bank of France, or any bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) of countries outside the French Franc Area; residents bringing in foreign bank notes or other foreign means of payment must surrender any amount in excess of CFAF 5,000 to an authorized bank within eight days and must make a declaration to the customs upon entry. 189 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution COTE D'lVOIRE Capital Capital movements between Cote d'lvoire and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require exchange control approval, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. Special controls (additional to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable) are maintained over borrowing abroad, over foreign inward direct investment, over all outward investment in foreign countries, and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Cote d'lvoire. Such operations require prior authorization by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, as do issues by Cote d'lvoire companies. Exempt from authorization, however, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Cote d'lvoire Government, and (2) shares similar to securities whose issuing, advertis- ing, or offering for sale in Cote d'lvoire has already been authorized. With the exception of controls relating to foreign securities, these measures do not apply to relations with France (as defined above), Monaco, member countries of the WAMU, and the Operations Account countries. Special controls are maintained also over imports and exports of gold, over the soliciting of funds for deposit with foreign private persons and foreign firms and institutions, and over publicity aimed at placing funds abroad or at subscribing to real estate and building operations abroad; these special controls also apply to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries. All investments abroad by residents of Cote d'lvoire require prior authorization by the Minister of Econ- omy and Finance.3 Foreign direct investments in Cote d'lvoire,4 are subject to prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. Effective June 15, 1981, at least 75 percent of investments abroad by residents of Cote d'lvoire must be financed by borrowing abroad. The liquidation of investments, whether direct investments or not, in Cote d'lvoire or abroad must similarly be reported in advance to the Minister. Both the making and the liquidation of investments, whether these are Cote d'lvoire investments abroad or foreign invest- ments in Cote d'lvoire, must be reported to the Minister within 20 days following each operation. Direct invest- ments are defined as investments implying control of a company or enterprise. Mere participation is not consid- ered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. 3Including those made through foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons resident in Cote d'lvoire and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies resident in Cote d'lvoire. Including those made in Cote d'lvoire by companies that are directly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in Cote d'lvoire of foreign companies. 190 Borrowing by residents from nonresidents requires prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans taken up by industrial firms to finance transactions abroad, to finance imports into or exports from Cote d'lvoire, or by approved international trading houses to finance international merchanting transactions; (2) loans contracted by authorized banks; and (3) loans other than those mentioned above, when the total amount outstanding of these loans, including the new borrowing, does not exceed CFAF 50 million for any one borrower, and provided that the annual interest rate does not exceed the normal market rate. The repayment of loans constituting a direct investment is subject to the formalities prescribed for the liquidation of direct investments. The repayment of other loans re- quires authorization only if the loan itself was subject to prior approval. Lending abroad is subject to exchange control authorization. Under the investment code introduced in 1984, special incentives are provided for foreign and domestic invest- ments in certain priority sectors and priority geo- graphical areas. The incentives include exemption from customs duties and tariffs on all imported capital equipment and spare parts for investment projects, provided that no equivalent item is produced in Cote d'lvoire. In addition, all such investments are exempted for a specified period, depending on the investment sector or area, from corporate profit taxes, patent contributions, and capital assets taxes. In general, the exemption covers 100 percent of applicable tax up to the third to last year of the exemption period, and is reduced progressively to 75 percent of the tax in the second to last year of the exemption period, 50 percent in the penultimate year, and 25 percent in the last year of the exemption period. The code does not exempt from import duties and taxes, imports of intermediate goods or raw materials for which no equivalents are produced locally. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Cote d'lvoire. Imports and exports of gold from or to any other country require prior authoriza- tion by the Minister of Economy and Finance, which is rarely granted. Exempt from this requirement are: (1) imports and exports by the Treasury or the BCEAO; (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles contain- ing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold- plated articles); and (3) imports and exports by travelers of gold articles up to a weight of 250 grams. Both licensed and exempt imports and exports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Changes During 1985 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CYPRUS (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Cyprus is the Cyprus Pound. The exchange rate for the Cyprus pound is adjusted daily with the aim of maintaining its effective relationship with the currencies of the main trading partners. On December 31, 1985 the official buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, were £C 0.5438 and £C 0.5429, respectively, per US$1. The Central Bank of Cyprus also quotes daily buying and selling rates for the deutsche mark, the Greek drachma, and the pound sterling. It also quotes indicative rates for other foreign currenciesl on the basis of market rates in international money market centers. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. The Central Bank offers authorized dealers (banks) facilities for forward purchases and sales of U .S. dollars and pounds sterling for periods of up to six months, in respect of trade and tourist transactions only. Rates for longer periods are available for exports and tourism on request. Administration of Control Exchange controls are administered by the Central Bank in cooperation with authorized dealers. Authority to approve applications for the allocation of foreign exchange for a number of purposes has been delegated to authorized dealers. Prescription of Currency Payments may be made by crediting Cyprus pounds to an External Account, or in any foreign currency;2 the proceeds of exports to all countries may be received in Cyprus pounds from an External Account, or in any foreign currency. Nonresident Accounts Residents of countries outside Cyprus may open and maintain with authorized banks nonresident accounts in Cyprus pounds, designated External Accounts, or Foreign Currency Accounts. These accounts may be credited freely with payments from nonresidents of Cyprus (such as transfers from other External Accounts or Foreign Currency Accounts), proceeds from sales of any foreign currency by nonresidents (including declared bank notes), and the entire proceeds, including capital appreciation, from the sale of an investment made by a nonresident in Cyprus with the approval of the Central Bank and with authorized payments in Cyprus pounds. External Accounts and Foreign Currency Accounts may be debited for payments to residents and nonresidents, for remittances abroad, for transfers to other External Accounts or Foreign Currency Accounts, and for pay- ments in cash in Cyprus. Companies registered or incorporated in Cyprus that are accorded nonresident status by the Central Bank may maintain External Accounts and Foreign Currency Accounts in Cyprus or abroad, as well as local disbursement accounts for meeting their payments in Cyprus. Blocked Accounts are maintained in the name of nonresidents for funds that may not immediately and in their entirety be transferred outside Cyprus under the existing exchange control regulations. Blocked funds may either be held as deposits or be invested in government securities or government-guaranteed securi- ties. Income earned on blocked funds so invested is freely transferable to the nonresident beneficiary or it may be credited to an External Account or Foreign Currency Account. In addition to income, the principal released in each such case annually for transfer outside Cyprus may not exceed £C 5,000. Funds can also be released from Blocked Accounts to meet reasonable educational expenses in Cyprus of the account holder's children, reasonable living expenses of the account holder while visiting Cyprus, donations to charitable institutions in Cyprus, and for other authorized purposes. Imports and Import Payments Imports of fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, and fresh meat are prohibited. Most other imports are free of licensing requirements. Only imports of certain com- modities require an import license. Such commodities include goods produced or manufactured locally, as well as all machinery, plant and equipment, spare parts and accessories. The Minister of Commerce and Industry may take measures whenever required to regulate the importation of goods for the encouragement of local production and manufacture. Exchange is allocated to pay for imports freely and without restriction through authorized banks, provided that documentary evidence of shipment or actual importation of goods is available. Advance payments before shipment require the prior approval of the Central Bank, except for imports whose value does not exceed £C 500. Payments for imports requiring a license are expected to be made within the time limits specified on the license. An import surcharge of 6 percent (3.9 percent for imports from EC countries) ad valorem is levied on all imports except food, feedstuff, Pharmaceuticals, and goods imported by the Government. Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs (commer- cial), Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. 2Foreign currencies are all currencies other than the Cyprus pound. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles abroad require the approval of the Central Bank, but approval for certain types of payments has been delegated to authorized banks. 191 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CYPRUS Profits, dividends, and interest from approved foreign investments are transferable abroad without limitation, after payment of any due charges and taxes. Insurance premiums due to foreign insurance companies are remit- table after deduction of all contingencies. Allowances are granted for study abroad at colleges, universities, or other institutions of higher education, and certain lower- level institutions of learning. Exchange allowances are based on the cost of living and cover the fu ll amount of tuition fees plus living expenses for the student. For studies in the Eastern Mediterranean, the Middle East, Yugoslavia, and COMECON countries, the maximum yearly allowance for living expenses is £C 1,800; for Canada and the United States, £C 4,400; for the United Kingdom, £C 3,000; and for all other countries, £C 2,600. There is no limit for the remittance of foreign exchange for payment of tuition fees. The exchange allowance for tourist travel is £C 450 a person a year; the allowance for business travel is not fixed, but depends on the length of stay abroad, the country or countries to be visited, and the purpose; for medical treatment abroad, the amount is unlimited but based on actual expenses. On leaving Cyprus, travelers may take out with them up to £C 50 in currency notes. There is no limit on the amount of foreign currency notes that departing residents may take out of the country as part of any of their foreign exchange allowances. Nonresident travelers may take out any amount of foreign currency notes they de- clared on arrival. Foreign currency notes equivalent to US$1,000 need not be declared. In addition, authorized banks may convert up to £C 100 into foreign currency for departing nonresidents. Furthermore, authorized banks are permitted to issue to nonresidents any amount of foreign currency notes against external funds. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of potatoes and carrots are subject to control by the respective Marketing Boards, and those of wheat, barley, and maize to control by the Cyprus Grain Commission. Exports of cement are subject to a license for the purpose of ensuring adequate domestic supply. All exports are subject to licensing when the f .o .b. value exceeds £C 100, to ensure the inflow of the sales proceeds. Export proceeds must be surrendered without delay. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles must be sold to an authorized bank. Persons entering Cyprus may bring in any amount in foreign currency notes and up to £C 50 in Cyprus currency notes. Capital Payments abroad of a capital nature require prior approval. Applications for outward direct investment by residents are approved provided they are expected to contribute to foreign exchange inflows and the exporta- tion of goods and services. Such investments include those by construction and tourist companies. 192 Investments in Cyprus by nonresidents require prior approval of the Central Bank. In considering applica- tions, due regard is given to the purpose of the investment, the extent of possible foreign exchange savings or earnings, introduction of know-how, and, in general, the benefits accruing to the national economy. Foreign direct investment is normally permitted in selected fields of production such as export-oriented industries and new products. Yearly profits and proceeds from the liquidation of approved foreign investments may be repatriated in full at any time, after payment of any due charges and taxes. With the permission of the Council of Ministers, alien nonresidents may acquire in Cyprus immovable property for use as a residence or holiday home; they are required to pay the value of such property in foreign exchange. The sales proceeds of such property are transferable outside Cyprus up to the amount originally paid for the purchase of the property; the balance, if any, is transfer- able at the yearly rate of £C 5,000. Residents of Cyprus (Cypriots or foreign nationals) who take up residence outside Cyprus may transfer abroad immediately up to £C 5,000; any excess amount is deposited in a Blocked Account and released at the rate of £C 5,000 per year. The transfer abroad of funds resulting from estates and intestacies and from the sale of real estate is limited to £C 5,000, with any excess amount to be credited to a Blocked Account and also released at the rate of £C 5,000 per year. Transactions in foreign securities owned by residents require prior permission from the Central Bank. In principle, all securities held abroad by residents are subject to registration. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Cyprus for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities, authorized dealers in gold, and industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Authorized dealers in gold are permitted to import gold only for the purpose of disposing of it to industrial users. The export of gold requires the permis- sion of the exchange control authorities. Changes During 1985 Payments for Invisibles January 1. The basic tourist travel allowance was increased from £C 350 to £C 450 a person a year. January 25. The maximum amount of Cyprus bank notes allowed to be imported into or exported from Cyprus by travelers was increased from £C 10 to £C 50. February 28. It was announced that, without reference to the Central Bank, authorized banks could sell foreign exchange for business or professional travel abroad, for up to £C 100 daily within a limit of £C 1,000; they could also issue credit cards valid abroad to pay hotel and restaurant bills and transportation expenses, but the ©International Monetary Fund.

Not for Redistribution DENMARK (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Denmark is the Danish Krone. Denmark participates with Belgium, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands in the exchange rate and intervention mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS). In accordance with this agreement, Denmark maintains the spot exchange rates between the Danish krone and the currencies of the other participants within margins of 2.25 percent (in the case of the Italian lira, 6 percent) above or below the cross rates based on the central rates expressed in European Currency Units (ECUs). The agreement implies that the National Bank of Denmark (the central bank) stands ready to buy or sell the currencies of the other participating states in unlim- ited amounts at specified intervention rates. On Decem- ber 31, 1985 these rates were as follows: Specified Intervention Rates Per: 100 Belgian or Luxembourg francs 100 deutsche mark 100 French francs 100 Netherlands guilders 100 Irish pounds 100 Italian lire Danish Kroner Upper limit Lower limit 18.543 371.40 121.11 329.63 1,147.35 0.5676 17.727 355.06 115.78 315.13 1,096.87 0.5035 The participants in the EMS are not maintaining the exchange rates for other currencies within fixed limits. However, in order to ensure a proper functioning of the system, the Danish central bank intervenes to smooth out fluctuations in exchange rates. Middle rates for 20 foreign currencies are quoted daily on the basis of market rates.l On December 31, 1985 the middle rate for the U.S. dollar was DKr 896.90 per US$100. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Authorized exchange dealers may engage in arbitrage, both spot and forward. Spot transactions are defined as transactions where actual delivery takes place within two banking days; transactions that mature in three banking days or more are defined as forward transactions. Spot transactions in all currencies, including Danish kroner, and forward transactions involving purchases of foreign currencies against sales of foreign currencies may be concluded freely with domestic and foreign banks. Forward transactions that involve Danish kroner may also be concluded, but for not more than three years.

Forward transactions that involve resident and nonresident purchases of foreign currencies against sales of Danish kroner must cover contractual payments, the payments covered being due not more than three years from the date of the forward contract. There are no restrictions on forward transac- tions that involve resident and nonresident purchases of Danish kroner against sales of foreign currencies, other than the three-year limit on maturity. Denmark formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from May 1, 1967. Exchange Control Territory The Danish Monetary Area comprises Denmark, Greenland, and the Faeroe Islands. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the National Bank and the authorized exchange dealers, that is, most banks, some savings banks, and some stock exchange brokers who are members of the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. The exchange regulations generally do not apply to individual transactions and transfers of DKr 40,000 or less. Transfers of up to DKr 40,000 may, in any event, be made without delivery of forms. Permission, when required, for foreign direct invest- ments in Denmark has to be obtained from the Ministry of Industry. Licenses for imports and exports, when required, are issued by the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Agriculture, or the Ministry of Fisheries. Prescription of Currency Payments to or from foreign countries may be made in any foreign currency or in Danish kroner. Nonresident Accounts Nonresident Krone Accounts are convertible. The only exceptions are Emigrant Accounts. Krone Accounts may be opened by authorized banks for foreign banks, insurance companies, and shipping companies, and for institutions of the EC. They may also be opened for other nonresidents, provided that the total credit balance of the accounts of an individual nonresi- dent does not exceed DKr 300,000; any amount in excess of DKr 300,000 must be transferred abroad within three days. Special accounts not subject to a maximum balance may be opened for nonresidents, provided they are credited only with the liquidation proceeds or capital earnings from certain investments in Denmark and some other funds. Emigrant Accounts are kept by authorized exchange dealers for holding liquid assets owned by or accruing to Danish emigrants, to the extent that the amounts exceed ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution the exchange allowance of DKr 100,000 available to each person at the time of departure. Certain payments to residents may be made freely from these accounts, and the balances are in any case made convertible one year after departure. notes or other means of payment. Nonresidents may, in addition, export amounts of up to DKr 50,000 or any such larger amount in Danish kroner and foreign ex- change that they can substantiate as having been im- ported upon entry into Denmark. DENMARK Imports and Import Payments Most commodities, except for textiles, are free of licensing from all sources. For textiles, a common EG system of export-import licenses has now been established for almost all countries exporting low-priced textiles. The only commodities that require a license when originating in or purchased from member countries of the EC are alcoholic beverages and unwrought and semimanufactured gold. A few items require a license when originating in Japan, the Republic of Korea, or any other non-state-trading, non-EC country. A larger num- ber of items require a license when originating in or purchased from Albania, Bulgaria, the People's Re- public of China, Czechoslovakia, the German Demo- cratic Republic, Hungary, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, the U .S .S .R ., or Viet Nam. Payments for imports and the related shipping ex- penses may as a general rule be made freely within five years from the end of the month in which the goods were cleared through customs, provided that the terms of payment conform to normal commercial practice in the trade concerned. Repayments of debts must not be made more than 30 days before the day stipulated as the latest in the contract (or before the latest customary date in the trade). However, commercial credits can be repaid at any time if a discount is obtained as a result, provided the payment is made to the supplier and conforms to normal commercial practice in the trade concerned. Prepayments linked to trade in goods and services that are in conformity with normal commercial practice may be granted to nonresidents up to one year prior to the expected date of import or the effected date of perfor- mance of the service; the permitted period is up to five years for capital goods (ships, aircraft, heavy machinery, and major installations) when purchased for an amount of DKr 1 million or more. All other advance payments for imports require prior approval by the National Bank. Payments for Invisibles Payments by residents for invisibles may in general be made freely; only a few cases require approval. Autho- rized banks are empowered to allow the transfer of funds to an account abroad kept by a person of foreign nationality who has not resided in Denmark for more than seven years, provided that the balance of the account does not exceed DKr 200,000. Foreign ex- change for travel is allocated freely and may be obtained for travel to any country, but not earlier than 30 days before the trip if the amount applied for exceeds the equivalent of DKr 40,000. Travelers may take out freely DKr 40,000 in Danish bank notes and coin, and any amount in foreign bank Exports and Export Proceeds Gold is the only commodity that requires a license when exported to member countries of the EC. Except for certain items subject to strategic controls, licenses for exports to other destinations are required only for waste and scrap of certain metals and monetary gold. Export proceeds must be transferred to Denmark without undue delay unless the National Bank permits otherwise. However, such amounts collected abroad may be kept in an account with a foreign bank for a maximum period of 30 days; otherwise, foreign ex- change receipts must either be offered for sale to the National Bank or to an authorized exchange dealer without undue delay, or kept in an account with an authorized exchange dealer for a maximum period of three months. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange derived from invisibles must be transferred to Denmark, unless the National Bank per- mits otherwise, and offered for sale to the Bank or to an authorized exchange dealer without undue delay, with exceptions similar to those that apply to export proceeds (see section on Exports and Export Proceeds, above). Travelers may bring in any amount of Danish bank notes and coin, foreign bank notes, and other Danish or foreign means of payment. Capital Both inward and outward transfers of capital and all borrowing and lending between residents and nonresi- dents are subject to exchange control and may be restricted. The general rules on exchange control issued by the Ministry of Industry are based on EC directives on capital movements and the OECD Capital Code; no distinction is made in these rules between residents of member countries of the EC and those of the rest of the world. Residents have an obligation to repatriate pro- ceeds realized from the sale or liquidation of assets abroad. Transfers abroad may be made by residents to pay interest on, or to redeem upon maturity, or to repurchase any Danish securities. Residents may lend amounts not exceeding DKr 2 million in a calendar year to subsidiary companies (direct investments of loan capital) or, in the case of resident persons, DKr 500,000 in a calendar year to a member of the resident's family. Contributions from a parent enterprise to a branch are treated as direct investment of equity capital. Residents may buy foreign shares as portfolio investments, provided that these are listed on the stock exchange, or in other cases, provided that these are acquired on the basis of a subscription right to shares or the like owned by the resident concerned. 195 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution DENMARK Residents may only subscribe to or purchase foreign bonds with an original maturity exceeding two years that are listed on a stock exchange. The purchases have to be made through an authorized exchange dealer against cash. The Central Bank applies a liberal procedure to the approval of residents' purchases of unlisted foreign securities. No special permission is required for residents to make transfers abroad, within certain limits, in connec- tion with most direct investments or with private acquisi- tions of real estate abroad. The limits are DKr 10 million a year for each foreign enterprise for direct investments of equity capital.2 Private acquisition of real estate for noncommercial purposes and expenses related to build- ing and construction work on such property can be made without limitations. Direct investments abroad by resi- dents are normally approved in accordance with Den- mark's obligations as a member of the EC and the OECD. Authorized exchange dealers do not need special permission to grant loans to nonresidents for the financing of payments to residents for purchases of Danish goods and services, provided normally that the loan is granted directly to the foreign purchaser; in those cases where the National Bank's approval is required, this is generally given when the loans are customary in the trade concerned. Permission from the National Bank is required for certain other transfers abroad of a capital nature by residents. Danish emigrants are granted an exchange allowance of up to DKr 100,000 for each person at the time of departure. The remaining liquid assets must be credited to an Emigrant Account in the name of the owner and may be transferred abroad one year after departure, or earlier if the emigrant can show that he has taken up permanent residence abroad with the approval of the relevant foreign authorities. Inward direct investment in the form of equity capital may be made without prior license if the investment does not increase total direct foreign investment in the enterprise concerned by more than DKr 10 million in each calendar year. However, prior license is always required if the investment is undertaken by a foreign firm in which a resident directly or indirectly owns an interest representing a direct investment. Direct investments require notification to the National Bank if they are made without a prior license. A contribution from a parent company to a branch is treated as direct investment of equity capital. Other direct investments by nonresidents require permission from the exchange control authori- ties, which is granted liberally in accordance with Denmark's obligations as a member of the EC and the OECD. The purchase by a nonresident of real property in Denmark normally requires a special license from the Ministry of Justice; permission is usually granted readily where real estate is to be used for industrial or similar enterprises. 2A license is required, however, for investments in firms that are engaged exclusively or largely in capital investments or financing. 196 The sale to nonresidents of Danish bonds listed on a stock exchange does not require a special license. Nonresidents may freely purchase or subscribe to all types of Danish shares, including shares of joint stock and private companies; they may also acquire private mortgage deeds with a residual maturity of five years or more. Residents may as a general rule take up loans for up to five years from nonresidents to finance imports of commodities and services; they may also take up such loans to finance the granting of credits for exports of commodities and services, provided that the credits are in conformity with normal commercial practice and that the maturity of the loans does not exceed the borrowers' credits to nonresidents in connection with exports of goods and services. Most business enterprises may borrow abroad without restriction, provided that the maturity is at least one year. Residents may take up loans of up to DKr 500,000 in a calendar year from the borrower's family members. Foreign borrowing by municipalities and public utility companies is sub- ject to control by the appropriate department of the Government. Transfers of proceeds from the sale or liquidation of all types of investments and transfers of all other liquid funds in Denmark owned by nonresidents, other than new emigrants, are permitted freely, irrespective of when and how the original investment was acquired. Interest and repayment of principal on authorized loans, credits, and deposits received from persons and firms who are nonresidents at the time of receipt may be paid freely, with the proviso that loans and credits obtained from a nonresident generally must not be amortized or repaid in fu ll more than 30 days before the amortization payment or repayment is due. Inheritances and gifts to relatives may normally be transferred to any country without limitation. Individual payments above DKr 40,000 as gifts to persons other than relatives are subject to approval from the National Bank. Imports and exports of securities are subject to regulation, the details of which are established by the National Bank. Bona fide imports and exports of Danish and foreign securities are permitted. Danish securities held in Denmark and belonging to nonresidents may, in most cases, be sold freely to residents. Foreign securities held in Denmark may be negotiated freely between residents, provided that the exchange control regulations are not circumvented. Authorized foreign exchange dealers' commercial net balances in accounts with foreign countries may be negative to the extent of an amount equal to the loans that the authorized dealer has granted to residents in foreign currency in conformity with the exchange control regulations and, for the purpose of financing Denmark's foreign trade, within a limit of DKr 3 million; for banks and savings banks, the limit is up to 5 percent of net worth (up to 10 percent of net worth allowed under certain conditions). A positive net commercial foreign ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution position is, in principle, allowed only so long as it does not exceed DKr 2 million or, for banks and savings banks, 15 percent of the capital and reserves, whichever is higher. Gold Residents may freely buy, hold, and sell gold coin in Denmark; they may also import gold coin. Otherwise, residents other than the monetary authorities and autho- rized industrial and dental users are not allowed to acquire gold abroad. Imports and exports of gold normally require licenses issued by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial and dental users. Imports of gold in bars or coin, unless made by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, are subject to value- added tax at a rate of 22 percent; domestic transactions in gold are also taxed at a rate of 22 percent. There is no customs duty on imports of gold in bars or coin. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement July 22. The intervention limits of the Danish krone within the EMS were redefined as follows, with respect to the Italian lira: DENMARK Specified Intervention Rates Per: Danish Kroner Upper limit Lower limit 100 Italian lire 0.5676 0.5035 June 1. The maximum amount of foreign exchange transactions exempted from exchange control require- ments was increased from DKr 25,000 to DKr 40,000. Capital June 11. The length of the period during which residents could maintain foreign exchange accounts with Danish banks was extended from 30 days to three months. In addition, the limit on foreign investment in Danish enterprises without prior permission was raised from DKr 5 million to DKr 10 million annually, and the corresponding limit on investment by residents in foreign enterprises was increased from DKr 2 million to DKr 10 million annually. The minimum permissible maturity for finance loans contracted abroad by resi- dents was lowered from five years to one year, and it was announced that the Central Bank would introduce a liberal procedure for approving residents' purchases of unlisted foreign securities. 197 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution DJIBOUTI (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Djibouti is the Djibouti Franc, which is freely convertible into U.S. dollars, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of DF 177.721 = US$1. The buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar are DF 176.84 and DF 179.48, respectively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates for certain other currenciesl are set by local banks on the basis of cross rates for the U.S. dollar in international markets. The posted rates are subject to commission charges of 1.5-6.0 percent set by the commercial banks, depending on the currency concerned. In addition, there is a fixed commission amounting to DF 300 for transfers in Djibouti francs, DF 500 (or US$3.00) for transfers in foreign currencies, and zero for transfers in French francs. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. On September 19, 1980 Djibouti formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control There is no exchange control and no prescription of currency. The Djibouti franc is issued in notes and coins by the National Bank of Djibouti, which issues and redeems the currency against U.S. dollars. Deposits in U.S. dollars constitute the cover for the notes issued. Prescription of Currency All settlements with Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Otherwise, no prescription of currency re- quirements are in force. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Djibouti has a free trade zone in the port of Djibouti, but Deutsche mark, French francs, pounds sterling, and Swiss francs. the territory as a whole does not constitute a free zone. Formally, no customs duty is charged on imports, but in practice, fiscal duties are levied by means of indirect taxes (the general consumption tax). The rate of the general consumption tax is 26 percent for luxury goods and 23 percent for all other goods. A surtax of 5 percent is levied on the c . i . f. value of most imports. Certain commodities, including alcoholic beverages, noncar- bonated mineral water, petroleum products, khat, and tobacco, are subject to surtaxes at various rates. Addi- tional taxes are levied on imported milk products and fruit juices. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Otherwise, there are virtually no restrictions on exports, with the exception of the prohibition on exports of live animals. Export proceeds may be retained. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles No restrictions are imposed on payments for or proceeds from invisibles, except that payments must not be made to or received from Israel and South Africa. Capital No restrictions are imposed on inward or outward capital transfers, but payments may not be made to or received from Israel and South Africa. Under the Investment Code of June 5, 1975, enterprises established or expanded to undertake certain specific economic activities are eligible for various tax exemptions. Changes During 1985 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 198 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution DOMINICA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Dominica is the Eastern Caribbean Dollar,1 which is issued by the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB). The Eastern Caribbean dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at EC$2.70 = US$1. On December 31, 1985 the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were EC$2.6949 and EC$2.7084, respectively, per US$1. The ECCB also quotes daily rates for the Canadian dollar and the pound sterling. There is a 2.5 percent tax on sales of foreign exchange for invisible trade transactions involving more than EC$100. Dominica informed the Fund on December 13, 1979 that it formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Ministry of Finance and applies to all countries outside the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank area. The Ministry of Finance has delegated to commercial banks certain of its powers to approve sales of foreign currencies within specified limits. The Ministry of Trade administers import and export arrangements and controls. Prescription of Currency Settlements with residents of territories participating in the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank Agreement must be made in Eastern Caribbean dollars; those with member countries of the Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM)2 must be made in the currency of the CARICOM country concerned. Settlements with residents of other countries may be made in any foreign currency.3 Foreign Currency Accounts Foreign currency accounts may be operated only with the permission of the Ministry of Finance; such permis- sion is normally confined to major exporters and foreign nationals not ordinarily resident in Dominica. The accounts can only be credited with foreign currencies obtained outside Dominica. Payments from these ac- counts require no approval, but transactions are subject to the foreign exchange sales tax. Imports and Import Payments All imports from South Africa are prohibited. Most other goods are imported under open general license, but 'The Eastern Caribbean dollar is also the currency of Angu i l la, Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, Montserrat, St. Christopher and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. 2The CARICOM countries are Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Chris- topher and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. 3Foreign currencies comprise all currencies other than the Eastern Caribbean dollar. individual licences are required for manufactures or items which compete with regionally available products. Payments for authorized imports are permitted upon presentation to a bank of documentary evidence of purchase. Advance payments for imports require prior approval by the Ministry of Finance. Payments for Invisibles All settlements overseas require exchange control approval. However, commercial banks have been dele- gated with authority to sell foreign currency to local residents as specified below: (a) for incidentals, EC$50, subject to a limit of EC$250 a person a year; (b) for each trip outside the area served by ECCB, EC$2,500 subject to a maximum of two trips in any 12-month period, and upon presentation of travel documents; (c) for bona fide business travelers, EC$350 for each day outside Dominica, provided the total does not exceed EC$10,500 in any 12-month period, and upon presenta- tion of travel documents; and (d) for overseas travel for medical treatment, EC$350 a day up to a maximum of EC$20,000 in any 12-month period, subject to the presentation of a medical certificate stating that the journey is necessary and upon presentation of travel documents. Amounts in excess of specified limits may be obtained with approval from the Ministry of Finance. Exchange control approval will normally be given for the payment of fees and subscriptions to recognized institutions and for such other educational items as newspapers, upon presentation of the invoice. Foreign currency may also be bought to meet educational expenses, including accommodation, up to EC$15,000 a student in each academic year. Outward remittances of cash gifts are allowed up to EC$ 1,000 a year to each recipient. Profits may be remitted overseas in fu l l, provided that the Comptroller of Inland Revenue has prior knowledge of the transfer. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to South Africa are prohibited, and specific licenses are required for the export of certain goods to any destination. The conversion of export proceeds to an Eastern Caribbean Central Bank currency account is mandatory, except where the exporter has a foreign currency account into which the proceeds may be paid. Export duties are levied on bananas, fresh fru i t, fruit juices, nu ts, essential oil, and timber. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign currency proceeds from transactions in invis- ibles must be sold to a bank or paid into a foreign currency account. There is no restriction on importation of bank notes and coin. 199 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution DOMINICA Capital All outward transfers of capital or profits require exchange control approval. The purchase by residents of foreign currency securities and of real estate located abroad is not normally permitted. Capital transfers, such as inheritances, to nonresidents require approval, which normally is granted, subject to the payment of any taxes due. Emigrants leaving Dominica to take up residence outside the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank area may transfer up to EC$20,000 (for a husband, w ife, and children under 18 years) from their assets, subject to income tax clearance. Approval from the Ministry of Finance may be granted in special cases for remittance of amounts in excess of EC$20,000. Direct investment in Dominica by nonresidents may be made with exchange control approval. The remittance of earnings on, and liquidation proceeds from, such investment is permitted, subject to the discharge of any liabilities related to the investment. The approval of the Ministry of Finance is required for nonresidents to borrow in Dominica. Any borrowing abroad by autho- rized dealers to finance their domestic operations re- quires the approval of the Ministry. Gold Residents are permitted to acquire and hold gold coins for numismatic purposes only. Small quantities of gold may be imported with the approval of the Ministry of Finance, for industrial purposes only. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement August 12. The levy of 1.5 percent on sales of foreign currency was increased to 2.5 percent and imposed on all sales of over EC$100, with the exception of payments for the importation of goods, which are exempt from that levy. Administration of Control April 7. In a revision of the exchange control regulations, the commercial banks were given new instructions on their delegated authority to approve sales of foreign currencies. Imports and Import Payments September 1. In conformity with the Nassau Agree- ment of 1984, common external tariffs were raised on a short list of import items similar to those produced or with potential supply capability within the CARICOM region, and the tariff rate on regional products listed in Schedule III of the CARICOM Treaty was reduced by 50 percent. Payments for Invisibles July 3. The ad valorem tax of 10 percent on all travel tickets was abolished. 200 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution DOMINICAN REPUBLIC (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Dominican Republic is the Dominican Peso. All foreign exchange operations, with the exception of those for which the peso counterpart had already been deposited with the Central Bank by January 23, 1985 or those that had been otherwise authorized by the Monetary Board as of this date, take place at the transaction-weighted average market- determined buying and selling rates of the last available survey published daily by the Central Bank (usually with a lag not exceeding two days). All other transac- tions not channeled through the Central Bank take place at the free market rate of the day. On December 31, 1985 the buying and selling rates of the Dominican Peso in terms of the U .S. dollar, as published by the Central Bank, were RD$2.94 = US$1 and RD$2.97 = US$1, respectively. A small fund of US$10 million created in 1984 for the importation of generic medicines continues to be ad- ministered at a rate of RD$2.00 = US$1.00; at the end of 1985 US$3,000 was left in this fund. A surcharge of 36 percent on exports of traditional products and services and another of 5 percent on exports of nontraditional products and specified services are collected at the point of conversion of foreign exchange proceeds into peso by the exporter, thereby involving a multiple currency practice.l Exchange transactions in U .S. dollars between the Central Bank and other banks carry a commission of l/32 of 1 percent. Commercial banks charge their customers commissions of 14 of 1 percent (buying) and l/2 of 1 percent (selling); an additional 1 percent commission is levied on payments by letter of credit. Foreign Currency Accounts Under a Monetary Board resolution of August 24, 1982 commercial banks are authorized to open two types of foreign exchange accounts for their clients.2 One of these is a noninterest-bearing U .S. dollar account, from which funds can be drawn to make payments for current transactions approved by the Central Bank. The other type of account yields interest at a rate announced periodically by the Central Bank but not more than 1 percentage point below the federal funds rate in the United States; such an account is subject to a m in imum deposit requirement of US$25,000. Both types of ac- count are subject to a 100 percent reserve requirement. Beginning in mid-November 1983, exchange banks have !On January 19, 1986 the surcharge rate on traditional exports was halved to 18 percent, and the one on nontraditional exports was eliminated. 2Since the end of 1971, interested natural and juridical persons could be authorized directly by the Monetary Board to open accounts denominated in U .S. dollars in the Dominican Republic's banking system. Balances in such accounts could be used freely to make payments abroad. been established and empowered to purchase and sell foreign exchange. Administration of Control Exchange control policy is determined by the Mone- tary Board and is administered by the Central Bank. Commercial banks are permitted to freely transact in foreign exchange. Payments abroad are subject to docu- mentation and limited to transactions via commercial banks. At the end of 1985, there were 12 commercial banks and 80 exchange banks operating in the foreign exchange market in the Dominican Republic. Prescription of Currency Imports from the United States that are financed by the U .S. Agency for International Development must be made under special letters of credit. Settlements with Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela may be made through special accounts established under reciprocal credit agreements within the framework of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA). Import payments in currencies other than the U .S. dollar must be made through letters of credit. Otherwise, no obliga- tions are imposed on importers, exporters, or other residents regarding the currency to be used for payments to or from nonresidents. Imports and Import Payments In principle, all import payments can be made with foreign exchange purchased freely in the market. Import settlements against collection or by draft must be denominated in U .S. dollars. Prepayment of letters of credit is required for certain imports. Beginning from November 1983, the prohibition on imports of vehicles no longer applies, but imports are subject to an annual quota of US$25 million. In principle, "nominal duty rates" range from a minimum of 40 percent to almost 900 percent for imports of malted beverages. Most of the nominal duty rates at the three- and four-digit level of the tariff schedule range between 40 percent and 75 percent. However, a num- ber of imports were exempted from the payment of these nominal duties. An internal consumption tax of 20 percent ad valorem and a 4 percent surcharge on the total amount of all customs charges are applied on all imports subject to the minimum duty of 20 percent, with the exception of agricultural and industrial machinery and inputs for the manufacture of agrochemical prod- ucts, which are subject to a 5 percent du ty. Payments for Invisibles Beginning from May 1984, all categories of invisible payments can be made freely through commercial banks, subject to documentation requirements. 201 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution DOMINICAN REPUBLIC Exports and Export Proceeds Certain exports are temporarily prohibited, including some food products and animal species, unprocessed wood (for environmental protection purposes), and blood (for public health reasons). In addition products imported under specified bilateral trade agreements are prohibited for export under the terms of such agree- ments. A number of products (such as sugar, molasses, coffee, and cocoa) are subject to prior authorization. Export licenses, issued by the Dominican Center for Export Promotion (CEDOPEX), are required for all products. A surcharge of 36 percent (traditional exports and services other than tourism) and of 5 percent (nontradi- tional exports, and certain services) are levied on export proceeds through the exchange system. The traditional exports are defined as raw sugar, molasses, refined sugar intended for the North American market, green coffee, roasted coffee, cocoa beans, cocoa liquor, cocoa cake, cocoa butter, leaf tobacco, gold, silver, and ferronickel. With specified exceptions, exporters must, within two working days of receiving payments, surrender to the Central Bank, through the commercial banks, foreign exchange equal to 100 percent of the value of their exports. For the purposes of exchange surrender, de- clared export prices must equal or exceed the minimum export prices established by CEDOPEX for certain exports. Firms operating in industrial free zones and ferronic- kel exports are exempted from the exchange surrender requirements and are required to convert only the foreign exchange needed by them to cover local costs and taxes. Law No. 69 provides for the issuance of tax credit certificates (certificados de abono tributario—CATs) for a value not exceeding 15 percent of the f .o .b. or c . i .f. value of exports; the percentage can be up to 25 percent when exports contain a high degree of domestic agricul- tural inputs. The CATs are, in principle, fully negotiable and can be used for the payment of taxes or other obligations to the Government. However, only a limited number of CATs have been issued. Law No. 69 also regulates the system of temporary admission for imports, under which duties are waived for any imports used in the manufacture of nontraditional products to be exported within a year. Nontraditional exports are entitled to a refund of a percentage of the import duties paid on raw materials or component parts used in the manufacture of goods subsequently exported; the refund is 90 percent on ex- ports containing only imported inputs, 95 percent on exports containing domestic inputs, and 100 percent on exports produced in the industrial free trade zone.3 Exporters are also eligible for a refund of 95 percent of any internal tax levied on locally manufactured goods that are exported. Exporters may not extend credit to foreign buyers for more than 90 days from the date of shipment without authorization by the Central Bank. 3 Nontraditional exporters who qualify under the temporary import regime of Law No. 69 are also fully exempted from the payment of import duties. 202 Proceeds from Invisibles With certain exceptions, such as those relating to tourism and remittances of Dominicans living abroad, foreign exchange proceeds from invisibles must be surrendered to the Central Bank through the commercial banks. Such proceeds are subject to a surcharge of 36 percent or of 5 percent, depending on their classifi- cation. The import of Dominican bank notes and coin is prohibited. Capital There are no restrictions on the inward movement of capital by either residents or nonresidents. However, direct foreign investment is regulated by Law No. 861 of July 19, 1978, which created a Directorate of Foreign Investment to approve direct investment requests. Such investments must be registered with the Central Bank. Beginning from May 1984, outward remittances related to investments are made freely through the banks, subject to prior registration with the Central Bank. Foreign debt can be contracted directly by the Central Government, subject to congressional authorization. According to Law No. 251 of 1964, new loans by other public and private entities require Monetary Board authorization. According to a set of criteria established by the Monetary Board on November 19, 1981, priority in the approval of new loans is given to foreign borrowing for export, import substitution, and social projects such as housing and education. Total financial charges on foreign loans are not allowed to exceed the principal international interest rate by more than 3 percent. There are also minimum maturity require- ments according to the type of financing. Beginning from January 23, 1985, the Central Bank provides foreign exchange for the servicing of public external debt at the market rate; the servicing of private external debt is effected through the market. There are no restrictions on the amount of foreign exchange that Dominican residents can purchase in the market. Gold Residents may purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in the Dominican Republic for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authori- ties and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, in the Dominican Republic or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler require licenses issued by the Central Bank; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users.

Procedures and conditions for settlement of letters of credit approved before April 17, 1984 were announced, and an audit commission was established (Monetary Board Resolution No. 1). March 22. The advance import deposit requirement for imports financed under reciprocal credit agreements with Latin American central banks was reduced from 100 percent to 50 percent of value. The remaining 50 percent of the deposit would be required at the time of settlement for transaction through the Central Bank (Monetary Board Resolution No. 12). Exports and Export Proceeds January 23. An Exchange Stabilization Fund was established to be financed from proceeds from a 36 percent surcharge on exports of traditional products DOMINICAN REPUBLIC and services and a 5 percent surcharge on exports of nontraditional products and certain services. Both levies were to be collected at the point of receipt by the exporter of the local-currency counterpart of export proceeds, thereby constituting exchange taxes and in- volving a multiple currency practice. Receipts from tourism and Dominicans living abroad were not affected. March 22. The surcharge applicable to exchange proceeds from industrial free zones was reduced from 36 percent to 5 percent. Proceeds from Invisibles January 23. An arrangement was introduced under which proceeds from transactions financed with credit cards were to be directed to the Banco de Reservas. Capital March 22. Foreign exchange receipts in the form of foreign investments, loans, transfers, and expenditures of diplomatic missions were exempted from surcharges (Monetary Board Resolution No. 8). 203 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ECUADOR (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Ecuador is the Ecuadoran Sucre. There are two exchange markets: the official market of the Central Bank and a legal parallel market. The exchange rate in the official market of the Central Bank may be flexibly determined but has been kept fixed at S/. 95.00 (buying) and S/. 96.50 (selling) since Novem- ber 12, 1985 when the official and intervention markets were un if ied. The buying and selling rates for other currencies1 are officially quoted on the basis of daily buying and selling rates against the U.S. dollar in foreign markets. Sales and purchases of foreign exchange by oil companies are subject to a service charge of S/. 0.25 per US$1. Loan capital from international agencies and foreign governments to the Government and public institutions is converted at the intervention rate prevail- ing on the disbursement date. External loans are subject to a tax that varies between 0.5 percent and 2 percent for maturities of 6 months to 24 months. Exempted from this tax are: (1) loans of more than 24 months; (2) loans from foreign govern- ments and international agencies; (3) loans to the public sector; and (4) suppliers' credits involving no inflow of foreign exchange. An arrangement for refinancing specified private external debt involves different implicit exchange rates arising from charges imposed on the official rate to compensate for possible exchange losses. Ecuador formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, with effect from August 31, 1970. Administration of Control The Monetary Board has authority to shift transactions between the two exchange markets and has extensive powers with respect to import policy. The official market is under the control and supervision of the Central Bank, which also issues import and export licenses and regis- ters foreign capital. Imports entering the country as part of a direct foreign investment and imports by foreign enterprises that have contracts with the Government require prior authorization by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Integration (MICEI) and, when exemp- tions from fiscal charges are sought, by the Ministry of Finance. The MICEI authorizes and supervises foreign investment in Ecuador.

Payments between Ecuador and Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Re- public, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Vene- zuela must be made w i th in the framework of the multilateral clearing system of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA). Exchange proceeds from other countries must be received in convertible currencies. Whenever possible, import payments must be made in the currency stipulated in the import license. Imports and Import Payments Permitted imports are divided into two categories: List I, consisting of priority goods (Group I "Special"), essential goods (Group A), and semiessential goods (Group B); and List II, consisting of less essential and luxury goods. All goods not included in these two lists are prohibited. Mainly for reasons of industrial protec- tion, certain imports require prior authorization from government ministries or agencies. With specified exceptions, prior import licenses are required for all permitted imports. Books, newspapers, periodicals, and printed music may be imported with or without prior import licenses; with import licenses, the transactions are effected w i thout limitation through the Central Bank at the exchange rate of the intervention market; if w i thout import licenses, the transactions are effected directly through the free private market at the rate obtained on that market, except that recorded music may be imported only with an import license through the intervention market of the Central Bank. These imports are subject to payment of the applicable taxes and charges regardless of their purpose. Medicines and spare parts for machinery and automotive vehicles are free of license when valued at US$500 f .o .b. or less, but all applicable charges and taxes must be paid on them. In addition, the State Petroleum Corporation may import supplies, materials, and equipment necessary for the conduct of its business during emergency situations without obtaining a prior import license. A few goods may be imported only from member countries of the LAI A, and some only from Paraguay. With these exceptions, import licenses are issued freely irrespective of the origin of the goods, provided that: the appropriate import taxes (including import surcharges) have been paid; the required advance deposit payment of 80 percent of import duties has been made; prior ministerial authorization (where applicable) has been obtained; a credit arrangement with a m in imum maturity of 120 or 180 days (depending on the item) has been concluded with an outside party; and a certificate is submitted ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution showing that insurance has been arranged in Ecuador. Upon arrival of the merchandise, the importer must settle up to 20 percent of the total f .o.b. value in cash and must deposit sucres for the remaining amount, which has to be financed within the established minimum financing periods mentioned. As a condition for obtaining foreign exchange for import payments, importers are required to submit to the Central Bank inspection certificates issued by the Societe Generate de Surveillance, a Swiss-Based company. All imports are subject to a tax of 6 percent levied on commercial transactions. Furthermore, all imports are subject to a service charge of 1 percent of the c . i .f. value, unless they represent gifts or foreign loans. With certain exemptions, imports on List II are subject to an import surcharge of 30 percent ad valorem. Payments for Invisibles Payments for current invisibles are mostly unrestricted and can be settled at the official rate. The arrangement for the refinancing of private external debt involves different implicit exchange rates arising from the imposi- tion of charges on the official rate to compensate for possible exchange losses. These rates are applicable to the refinancing of private external credits contracted or endorsed by the domestic financial system or directly by the private sector, and to payment of interest on loan proceeds sold to the Central Bank before refinancing or sold in the same way at any time if under Resolution No. 1202, or those sold at the free market beginning from July 1, 1982 up to a day prior to short- or long-term financing. With respect to foreign loans to petroleum companies, interest, commissions, and other financial charges on foreign loans may not exceed the equivalent of 2 percent above the rates of interest of the creditor country, and annual amortization may not exceed the sum of undistributed profits, depreciation of fixed assets and liquidated assets, and any variation in working capital. Residents traveling abroad by air must pay a tax of S/. 602 for each exit visa. Airline tickets for foreign travel are taxed at 10 percent, and tickets for travel by ship are subject to tax at the rate of 8 percent for departure from Ecuador and 4 percent for the return trip. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports require licenses to ensure the required surrender of the exchange proceeds to the Central Bank; licenses are issued freely, subject to guarantee. All export proceeds must be surrendered not later than 30 days from the date of the export permit for exports against cash payment, exports of bananas, coffee beans, cacao beans, prawns in any marketable form, and other unprocessed seafood products; 90 days from the date of each shipment for perishable products appearing on the lists issued by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Integration, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Stock- breeding, provided it is shown that the sale was made on an installment basis or on consignment; no later than ECUADOR 60 days from the date of the export permit for the remaining primary products, provided it is shown that the sale was made on an installment basis; and no later than 180 days from the date of the export permit for products not mentioned above, provided it is shown that the sale was made on an installment basis; however, the Central Bank may extend these periods. No surrender is required for exports effected under authorized barter transactions; however, barter transactions require a prior contract. Minimum reference prices are established for exports of bananas, coffee, fish products, cacao, and semifinished products of cacao to help ensure the full surrender of the exchange proceeds. Reference prices are also established for exports of crude petroleum based on sales contracts; these serve as the basis for the calcula- tion of taxes, royalties, etc. Certain exports require prior authorization of specified ministries. Certain com- modities are subject to export taxes, payable at the time the export license is received, with the exception of the export tax on coffee, which is payable within one month of the receipt of the export license. Exports of coffee and cocoa are subject to a sliding-scale tax in relation to international prices; the tax ranges up to 13 percent for washed coffee, 20 percent for raw coffee, and 15 percent for cocoa. Proceeds from taxes on coffee and cocoa are channeled to price stabilization funds, farmer credit funds, and funds for both the national coffee and cacao programs. Proceeds from Invisibles All receipts from invisibles may be sold at the official rate. Travelers may bring in any amount of foreign or domestic bank notes. Capital Capital may freely enter or leave the country through the parallel market. Most borrowing abroad is subject to an exchange tax ranging from 0.5 percent to 2 percent (see section on Exchange Arrangement, above). All foreign direct investment in Ecuador must be registered with the Central Bank. New investment requires the prior authorization of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Integration. For foreign capital entering Ecuador in the form of machinery and equipment, the investor must show that the merchandise has been cleared through customs and that it took the form of a "nonreimbursable" import. Additionally, the investor must present to the Central Bank the certi- fication from the appropriate ministry that the declared value conforms to the actual value of the machinery and equipment. The Department of Credit and Foreign Investment of the Central Bank must submit a recom- mendation to the General Management of the Central Bank within 30 days from receipt of the request for registration and all pertinent documentation. Thereafter, the General Management of the Central Bank must approve or deny the request for registration for foreign exchange purposes within an additional 30 days, taking into account the interests of the Ecuadoran economy and 205 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ECUADOR priorities established in the country's development plans. In certain cases, where all documentation has been submitted, the Central Bank can provisionally register the investment for a period of up to 90 days. Similarly, loans granted to the Government or to official entities involving the disbursement for foreign exchange must be registered for foreign exchange pur- poses with the Exchange Department of the Central Bank; for all other foreign loans, registration is manda- tory for statistical purposes. In the case of short-term suppliers' credits, no special registration procedure is required. Foreign nationals are prohibited from owning rural properties and from owning or operating mining industries within 30 miles of Ecuador's coastline or borders. The Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Integration does not authorize direct foreign investment for the purpose of establishing publicity firms, commer- cial broadcasting stations, television stations, newspa- pers, or magazines. Withdrawal of foreign investment from Ecuador is allowed five years after the date of registration, on the basis of a schedule agreed by the Central Bank. Profits accumulated in previous years may be repatriated also on the basis of a schedule agreed by the Central Bank. The limit on the repatriation of profit remittances is 30 per- cent a year, or 40 percent for firms that export at least 40 percent of their production. Residents who are private individuals are not granted official foreign exchange by the Central Bank to pur- chase securities or real estate abroad. Commercial banks are authorized to maintain accounts with correspondent banks abroad in convertible currencies. Gold Residents other than the Central Bank may export gold only in the form of filigree work, the gold content of which does not represent more than 25 percent of its market value. Imports of monetary gold are reserved for the Central Bank. Imports of nonmonetary gold in bars may be made by the Central Bank; gold bars are exempt from import duty, while the duty on semi worked gold is 40 percent ad valorem; semi worked gold is treated as a List II import. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement March 5. The exchange arrangement was modified as follows: Proceeds from oil exports by the State Petro- leum Corporation (CEPE) were transferred from the official market to the intervention market. In addition, the servicing of public debt and registered private debt contracted and disbursed by September 4, 1984 was transferred from the official to the intervention market (Monetary Board Regulation No. 235/85). March 15. The Central Bank of Ecuador was pro- hibited from making advance sales of foreign currency for imports of goods and services other than medical products (Monetary Board Regulation No. 238/85). 206 June 7. All transactions remaining in the official market, with the exception of imports of medicine and related items, petroleum exports by foreign oil compa- nies, interest income on the international reserve of the Central Bank, profit remittances, and purchases of foreign exchange for study and medical care abroad, were transferred to the intervention market. August 28. Under Monetary Board Regulation No. 284/85, settlements in respect of payments for imports of medicine and related items, petroleum exports of foreign oil companies, interest income on the interna- tional reserves of the Central Bank, profit remittances, and purchases of foreign exchange for study and medical care abroad were transferred from the official to the intervention market. In addition, purchases and sales of foreign exchange for travel and royalty payments were transferred from the parallel market to the intervention market. As a transitional step, special provisions were made for the Central Bank to continue to sell foreign exchange at the official rate for the following transac- tions: (a) requests for foreign exchange at the official rate submitted prior to August 28, 1985 but still being processed by the Central Bank; (b) profit remittances arising from direct foreign investments registered with the Central Bank prior to September 4, 1984; (c) foreign exchange required by students and disabled persons who had registered with the Central Bank prior to Septem- ber 4, 1984 for the original term of their studies or medical treatment abroad; and (d) settlement in respect of previously eligible imports. In addition, the surpluses generated by foreign oil companies in Ecuador during the period April-August 1985 could be repatriated at the rate of S/. 67.85 per U.S. dollar irrespective of the prevailing official rate at the time of effecting the transfers. November 12. The exchange market was formally unified, by moving the official rate from S/. 66.5 per U.S. dollar to S/. 95.00 per U .S. dollar and terminating all transitional provisions to sell foreign exchange at a rate different from the new unified rate.

Not for Redistribution EGYPT (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Egypt is the Egyptian Pound, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at LE 1 = US$1.42857. The established buying and selling rates of the Central Bank of Egypt for the U .S. dollar on December 31, 1985 were LE 0.700 and LE 0.707, respectively, per US$1. Established rates for 16 other convertible currencies are based on cross rates quoted in New Yo rk .l The established rate applies on the receipt side only to proceeds from exports of petroleum, cotton, and second- grade rice, Suez Canal dues, SUMED pipeline revenues, and foreign exchange funds for the purpose of covering the local expenditure and related expenses of the oil exploration and drilling companies as well as their sub- contractors; on the payments side, it is applied to settle- ments for imports of certain essential foodstuffs, insec- ticides and fertilizers, and specified capital transactions. A special exchange rate, equivalent to LE 0.3913 = US$ 1, is used for transactions under bilateral payments agreements with countries that are not members of the International Monetary Fund, as well as for liquidation of accounts related to past bilateral payments agree- ments.2 A different rate, also established by the authori- ties, is applied to specified transactions through the authorized commercial banks, including, on the receipt side, local expenses of foreign embassies, consulates, international and regional organizations, and foreign company branches, as well as funds to cover the local expenses of SUMED and enterprises established in the context of international or regional agreements, and payments by foreigners for renewing residence permits; and, on the payment side, specified transactions includ- ing transfers by foreign aviation companies and (until December 18, 1986) external expenditures of domestic aviation companies. On December 31, 1985 the estab- lished buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar for transactions by the commercial banks were LE 0.83168 and LE 0.84000 per US$1, respectively. A premium exchange rate is used for all other transactions through the commercial banks; the rate is applied on the receipts side notably to workers' remit- tances, tourist receipts, and exports; and on the payments side, to, inter alia, public sector imports, capital transac- tions other than those assigned to the Central Bank, and Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Kuwaiti dinars, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. 2For the period through the end of February 1986, a temporary variable premium resulting in a rate of LE 0.70 = £ 1 was applied for visible trade transactions w i th in the framework of the bilateral payments agreements with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the U .S .S .R ., as well as for the tourist expenditures related to the U .S .S .R. 208 private import and import-related transactions. The commercial banks may freely utilize up to 75 percent of their foreign exchange receipts from transactions at the premium rate; the remaining 25 percent is utilized in accordance with regulations issued by the Central Bank. The premium exchange rate for transactions by the commercial banks is set by a committee composed of representatives from the Central Bank, the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade, and the commercial banks, largely on the basis of demand and supply conditions. On December 29, 1985 the premium buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were LE 1.3400 and LE 1.3534 per US$1, respectively. In addition, certain transactions, especially invisibles, take place through free accounts held with domestic banks ("own exchange"). Forward cover is available for foreign trade transac- tions. Banks do not require prior exchange control ap- proval for dealings or transactions in foreign currencies. Administration of Control Exchange control is supervised by a Committee for Foreign Exchange, under the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade, and is implemented under the supervision of the Under Secretary for Foreign Exchange Affairs. A foreign exchange budget is established annually. Banks are authorized to execute foreign exchange transactions, within the framework of a general authorization, without the need to obtain specific exchange control approval. The Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade supervises imports and exports. Certain imports and exports are reserved for public sector entities. Port Said City is accorded the status of a free zone. Prescription of Currency Payments to and from countries with which Egypt does not have bilateral payments agreements may be made in any convertible currency, in Egyptian pounds, or in a convertible currency to the debit or credit of the appropriate Free Account (see section on Nonresident Accounts, below), or in any other manner prescribed or permitted by the foreign exchange regulations manual. However, by a decision of the Central Bank, the proceeds from exports of raw cotton to convertible currency countries must be received in deutsche mark, Swiss francs, or U .S. dollars (in addition, for exports to France, Japan, and the United Kingdom, in the curren- cies of those countries). Settlements with countries with which Egypt has bilateral payments agreements are made according to the terms of those agreements.3 However, payments to such countries for imports and various other purposes not 3On December 31, 1985 Egypt maintained operative bilateral payments agreements w i th the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Sudan, and the U .S .S .R. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution covered by these agreements may be made in convertible currency. Certain settlements with countries w i th which indemnity agreements concerning compensation for nationalized property are in force are made through special accounts in Egyptian pounds with the Central Bank of Egypt. Suez Canal dues are expressed in SDRs and may be paid by debiting Canal Dues Accounts, Advance Payment Canal Dues Accounts, Free Accounts in Foreign Currency, or Free Accounts in Egyptian Pounds. Canal Dues Accounts must be opened in foreign currency, and balances are retransferable abroad. Nonresident Accounts In addition to the special accounts related to Egypt's bilateral payments agreements or to the indemnity agreements concluded with certain countries and Canal Dues Accounts, there are three types of accounts: Free Accounts, D Accounts, and Nonconvertible Capital Accounts. Free Accounts may be opened in the name of any entity other than the Egyptian Government, public authorities, and public sector entities. They may be opened either in foreign currency or Egyptian pounds; the latter are freely convertible. Free Accounts may be credited with transfers of convertible currency or with the proceeds from the sale of such currency; with transfers from other Free Accounts; w i th the proceeds of surrendered foreign bank notes, irrespective of the source; with interest on the accounts; and with the equivalent of any payment authorized in convertible currency. They may be debited for nonimport payments abroad in a convertible currency including imports; for transfers to other Free Accounts; for purchases of foreign bank notes or other means of payment; for any payments in Egypt, including those for exports; and for bank charges and commissions. D Accounts may be opened in the name of any resident of a country with which Egypt has a bilateral payments agreement. The accounts must be designated by the name of the partner country concerned. These accounts may be credited with receipts under the respective payments agreement and with the equivalent of transfers authorized to the country of the account holder. They may be debited for transfers to the country of the account holder and for local payments ( inc lud ing those for Egyptian exports) authorized by the implementing regu- lations and within the scope of the relevant payments agreement. Nonconvertible Capital Accounts must be credited with any payment of a capital nature to a foreigner living outside of Egypt that is not remittable under the exchange control regulations. Banks may debit these accounts for charges legally due from the account holder. Accounts held by individuals may be debited up to a limit of LE 2,000 a year for use by the account holder. Accounts held by juridical persons may be debited for settlement of outstanding obligations to the Egyptian authorities and for payments to residents for services rendered and up to a limit of LE 2,000 a year for EGYPT expenses incurred in connection with the activities or residence of the holder's employees in Egypt. Resident Accounts In addition to Free Accounts, which may be opened by both nonresidents and residents, residents may hold foreign currency in foreign exchange retention accounts, as described below. Foreign Exchange Retention Accounts may be opened in the name of authorized recipients and credited with all or part of proceeds from certain exports of goods and nonfactor services. Public sector companies may use these funds for their purposes within the provision of the foreign exchange budget or transfer them to other public sector companies within the same sector. Private sector exporters may debit these accounts for visible and invisible payments related to their economic activity. Exporters of onions, garlic, potatoes, peanuts, and citrus fruits are entitled to retain only 50 percent of their foreign exchange earnings. Banks are allowed to pay interest on the balances in retention accounts. With specified exceptions, balances in Foreign Exchange Retention Accounts must be surrendered at the an- nounced premium rate to the commercial banks six months after the funds have been deposited. Import Accounts in Foreign Exchange may be opened by authorized banks in the name of Egyptian nationals. These accounts may be credited with transfers in free currency, transfers from free accounts in foreign ex- change or in Egyptian pounds, transfers from another import account in foreign exchange, and the equivalent in free currency of any amount of foreign exchange submitted by clients, regardless of the means and the source. They may be debited to finance imports of the private sector on behalf of the account holder or others, to transfer abroad to cover invisible purposes related to the activity of the account holder, to settle obligations related to import transactions effected on behalf of the private sector, or in the form of foreign bank notes and other acceptable means of payment to cover the expendi- tures of the account holder or others abroad within the limit of US$5,000 (or its equivalent) a calendar year, provided that the amount drawn is registered on the user's passport and travel ticket. Imports and Import Payments All imports from South Africa are prohibited. A Supreme Council for the Planning of Foreign Trade is entrusted with establishing a long-term policy for exports and imports, controlling the annual export and import plan, and supervising the execution of the foreign exchange budget. Most imports from payments agree- ment countries (except those made under the "own exchange" arrangement), as well as imports of specified goods from any source, are reserved for the public sector. Imports by the central government, public authorities, and public sector companies, as well as certain private imports under the scheme for artisans and craftsmen, are 209 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution EGYPT effected within the provisions of the foreign exchange budget through the Central Bank and the authorized commercial banks. For purposes of administration, the economy is divided into several sectors (agriculture, industry, transportation, etc.). The annual foreign ex- change budget provides for a specific quota for each sector, and the authorities in charge of each sector decide upon the goods to be imported and the entities that are to import them within that quota. All imports financed by the Central Bank are at the established rate, with the exception of imports under bilateral payments agree- ments with countries that are not members of the Fund, which are financed at a special more appreciated rate. A more depreciated rate applies to imports financed by commercial banks. With certain exceptions, imports by the private sector take place through the "own exchange" system. Import licensing is required in the case of 277 items, which are subject to approval by the Import Rationalization Com- mittee. The list of controlled items includes foodstuffs and medicines (to ensure compliance with price con- trols), direct substitutes for domestically produced goods (for protective reasons), other items that are restricted for social reasons, and imports by luxury hotels. After an import license has been issued for items subject to approval by the Import Rationalization Com- mittee and before a letter of credit has been opened, an importer is required to lodge with an authorized commer- cial bank an advance import deposit in foreign currency as a percentage of the f .o .b. value for imports, ranging from 15 percent to 50 percent. Imports by companies registered under the Foreign Investment Law (Law No. 43 of 1974) are not subject to the advance import requirement. An economic development tax of 10 percent of the c . i .f. value is payable on imports; the tax is 5 percent for certain essential foodstuffs imported by the Ministry of Supply. A statistical tax of 1 percent of the c . i . f. value is payable on all imports except wheat. Payments for Invisibles Banks are authorized to provide foreign exchange for payments for certain invisibles in accordance with general authorizations and instructions and up to specific quotas. Residents may purchase, through local banks and up to specified amounts, the foreign exchange required for travel expenses and certain other purposes, at the premium rate announced for such transactions with the commercial banks. Egyptian nationals are entitled to retain their earnings in foreign exchange (except those accruing from exports and tourism) in Free Accounts and may use this foreign exchange freely for invisible payments abroad. They may also acquire additional foreign exchange through the medium of Free Accounts (see section on Nonresident Accounts, above). Travelers may not export more than LE 20 in Egyptian bank notes. Egyptian travelers may take with them any foreign exchange that they have acquired legitimately; foreign travelers leaving Egypt may reconvert their 210 remaining Egyptian pounds after deduction of US$30 for each night spent in Egypt. Exports and Export Proceeds Apart from exports to South Africa, which are prohibited, and commodities required for the national economy that may be restricted, exports may be made free of license. Exports of many products are organized and supervised by foreign trade committees. Cotton, rice, and petroleum are exported by the public sector only, and their proceeds must be repatriated within three months. Proceeds from exports of movies, television pro- grams, and video cassettes must be repatriated within six months. Proceeds from books, newspapers, and other publications must be repatriated as soon as received and in any case within a period not exceeding five years from the date of shipment. Proceeds from other exports must be repatriated within four months. Proceeds from exports other than petroleum, cotton, and rice may be fully or partially retained in Foreign Exchange Retention Ac- counts. Proceeds from exports to bilateral payments agreement countries must be obtained in accordance with the provisions of the relevant agreement. Some exports to specified countries may be settled through indemnity accounts. Proceeds from Invisibles Earnings abroad by persons other than the Egyptian Government, public authorities, and public sector entities may be held abroad or retained indefinitely in Free Accounts. Within specified limits, receipts from the provision of local hotel, transport, or travel agency services to tourists may be retained in Foreign Exchange Retention Accounts. Many public sector and other entities are permitted to retain their receipts from invisibles in Foreign Exchange Retention Accounts, and in many instances are exempt from the periodic surren- der requirements applied to these accounts. Certain travel in Egypt by foreigners may be financed from various special accounts, such as those under indemnity agreements with certain countries. Persons arriving in Egypt from abroad may import up to LE 20 in Egyptian bank notes and are permitted to bring in, and to use locally, unlimited amounts in foreign exchange; a customs declaration is required if the traveler wishes to re-export foreign currency. Foreign travelers must convert into Egyptian currency the equiv- alent of US$150 each at the established rate quoted by the commercial banks in order to obtain an entry visa. Capital Egyptian nationals who have deposited foreign earn- ings in Free Accounts in Egyptian banks may use this foreign exchange for any invisible payment, including transfer abroad. With this exception, outward capital transfers are restricted. Egyptian emigrants are autho- rized to transfer abroad funds up to LE 900 a person or ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution LE 3,500 a family, and to export other personal effects and furniture up to LE 200 a person or LE 500 a family. Authorized banks are empowered to import, export, and negotiate securities and to effect transfers related to the sale or purchase of either Egyptian or foreign securities. Brokers registered on the stock exchanges of Cairo and Alexandria are authorized to intermediate in the transfer of ownership of securities, whether at home or abroad, and to undertake the local collection or payment in foreign currency of the value of the securi- ties. Foreign and joint-venture banks are required to ensure that 15 percent of their foreign currency deposits can be made available on call, if necessary, by the Central Bank. Transfers of accrued alimony are permitted in accor- dance with court orders. An amount not exceeding LE 5,000 a family—irrespective of whether the sum is made up of capital or income—may be released from a family's assets in Egypt to persons of foreign nationality who leave the country permanently after a period of residence of at least five years. Any amount above this limit is credited to a Nonconvertible Capital Account. Any payment of a capital nature not remittable under the exchange control regulations must be credited to a Nonconvertible Capital Account. Law No. 43 of June 19, 1974 (amended by Law No. 32 of June 9, 1977) concerning the investment of Arab and Foreign Funds and the Free Zones defines the treatment of new foreign investments. Requests for transfers of profits not covered by this law are considered on an individual basis. Gold Authorized banks are empowered to buy, sell, and keep abroad gold (including gold coin) and other precious metals for the account of customers entitled to hold Free Accounts. Authorized banks may import such gold and other precious metals for local deposit and may subsequently re-export them. Certain persons other than the monetary authorities, including authorized industrial users, are allowed to import precious metals and stones for industrial and local market requirements. Exports of gold and silver fabrics are permitted, provided that the sales proceeds are repatriated in convertible currency. Travelers are permitted to take out and bring in gold jewelry within specified limits. There is a free market for gold coin in Cairo. A person arriving or departing may carry jewelry and other valuables up to LE 500. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement January 3. A 12-member committee was established and charged with the task of determining the premium on the official commercial bank rate; the rate would apply, with specified exceptions, to transactions by commercial banks. The committee was composed of the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank (as Chairman), a sub- governor of the Central Bank, two undersecretaries of EGYPT the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade, and representatives of eight commercial banks (the four public sector commercial banks and four private banks on a six-month rotation basis) (Ministerial Order (MO) No. 3). January 24. A circular issued by the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade specified that authorized commercial banks could freely utilize up to 75 percent of their foreign exchange receipts at the premium rate, with the remainder to be used in accordance with regulations issued by the Central Bank. April 6. A Chamber for the determination of the premium on the official commercial bank rate was established at the Central Bank, composed essentially of the same members as the committee that was set up on January 3 by MO No. 3. (The circular of January 24 was accordingly withdrawn.) July 26. It was announced that foreign exchange funds converted by foreigners for the purpose of renewing their residences should be effected through the authorized banks. December 18. Permission was granted for authorized banks to transfer any type of deposits and savings in foreign exchange from unknown sources (as well as the relevant interest) to free accounts in foreign exchange, provided that such deposits would be kept for a period of at least one year. Nonresident Accounts January 3. It was decided that foreign exchange funds in Free Accounts could no longer be used for effecting import payments. January 23. Authorization was granted until March 21, 1985 for private importers with outstanding balances in Free Accounts and Import Accounts on January 3, 1985 to use funds in Egyptian pounds resulting from the sale of such balances (at an exchange rate announced by the relevant committee) for imports related to the activities of the account holder. Resident Accounts January 3. Import Accounts, in effect since March 1982, were abolished and replaced by Free Accounts. Restrictions on the use of Foreign Exchange Retention Accounts were also introduced, limiting ex- porters' use of these accounts to visible and invisible payments related to their economic activities. Imports and Import Payments January 3. With specified exceptions, the "own exchange" system of financing private imports was abolished, and private importers were required to make import settlements by means of local currency payment through the commercial banks. In addition, the advance import deposit requirements, as a percentage of the f .o .b. value of imports, were reduced from 25 percent, 40 percent, 75 percent, and 100 percent, to 15 percent, 20 percent, 40 percent, and 50 percent, respectively (MD No. 5); all such deposits were also required to be 211 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution EGYPT made in domestic instead of foreign currency, as was done previously. January 5. Private importation of cars was restricted to authorized dealers on the basis of quotas, with the exception of Egyptians working abroad (who could import one car every four years) and persons needing cars for professional use. January 21. Imports of three items hitherto exempt from licensing requirement, namely reinforcing iron and steel bars, cement, and wood, were made subject to prior approval by the committee in charge of setting the premium exchange rate. January 23. Authorization was granted until March 21, 1985 for private importers with outstanding balances in Free Accounts and Import Accounts on January 3, 1985 to use funds in Egyptian pounds resulting from the sale of such balances (at an exchange rate announced by the relevant committee) for imports related to the activities of the account holder. April 6. The following changes were made in regula- tions affecting imports: (a) Authorization was granted for private sector imports financed by their own foreign exchange from Free Accounts, on condition that the payments for such imports, including the applicable advance deposit requirement, were made in foreign currency, (b) In a delineation of the sources and uses of funds transacted at premium exchange rate, Decree No. 168 was issued, specifying that the premium exchange rate should be applied to specified transactions proceeds from which should be channeled to a special fund (the "premium pool") within the commercial bank pool, and that the selling rate should be set at 1 percent above the buying rate, with the latter to be determined by the special Chamber attached to the Central Bank. The premium should be distributed equally between the commercial banks undertaking the transaction and a special account called the "Account for Profits Resulting from Foreign Exchange Transactions." The sources of funds for the "premium pool" would be all remittances to residents, all amounts exchanged from free accounts with the commercial banks, all exports assigned to the commercial bank pool, and all receipts from tourism other than the part required to be exchanged by tourists at the rate of LE 0.84 = US$ 1 at the port of entry. Funds in the "premium pool" would be used to finance imports covered under the foreign exchange budget (other than those assigned to the Central Bank pool), servicing of loans and credit within the commercial bank pool (within the limits established in the foreign exchange budget and excluding those assigned to the Central Bank pool), and all invisible payments other than those assigned to the Central Bank pool. In addition, accounts in Egyptian pounds opened under the facility to attract savings and approved by the Central Bank Chamber as eligible for the exchange rate premium would be considered as private accounts. Authorization was also granted for commercial banks to engage in interbank foreign ex- change trading, provided that it would be at the premium exchange rate determined by the Central Bank Chamber, (c) In an amendment to Ministerial Decree No. 316 of 1976 concerning sources and uses of foreign exchange funds that continued to be channeled to the commercial bank pool at the rate of LE 0.84 = US$1, the eligible sources were defined as foreign exchange to cover the domestic expenditure of foreign diplomatic missions, all transfers in respect of shipping transactions and local expenses of airline companies, all local foreign exchange expenditures of local subsidiaries, the SUMED pipeline and other international organizations, all foreign cur- rency required to be exchanged by tourists at the port of entry at the rate of LE 0.84 = US$1, and all invisible receipts of ministries and government bodies. Eligible uses were defined as all transfers of foreign airline and shipping companies, official travel expenditures, official medical expenses, transfers of pensions, and all invisible payments of ministries and government bodies. It was also specified that all transfers for the purchase of real estate by non-nationals and all transfers to finance petroleum drilling and exploration would be converted at the exchange rate of the Central Bank pool; all other transactions not otherwise specified in the decree should be channeled through the premium exchange rate pool of the commercial banks.

Not for Redistribution EL SALVADOR (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of El Salvador is the Salvadoran Colon. El Salvador maintains a two-tier exchange market system consisting of (a) an official market in which the Salvadoran colon is pegged to the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, at (^ 2.50 = US$1; and (b) a parallel market in which the value of the colon in principle is allowed to fluctuate, but which in practice is set by the banks. The rates of the Central Reserve Bank for transactions with the public are (£ 2.49 buying and $ 2.51 selling, per US$1. Official market transactions by commercial banks with the public take place within these limits. Buying and selling rates in the official market for other currencies are based on the daily quotations for the U.S. dollar in markets abroad. Buying and selling rates in the parallel market are determined by the commercial banks .l Only commercial banks, the Mortgage Bank, the Banco de Fomento Agropecuario (BFA), and the Banco Nacional de Fomento Industrial (BANAFI), are permitted to purchase or sell foreign exchange in the parallel market; individuals2 may open foreign accounts in the commercial banks and the Mortgage Bank and use the funds in such accounts to deal in the parallel market in respect of certain authorized transactions. A stamp tax of 0.1 percent is applicable to all sales of exchange; on amounts below <£ 100,000, the tax is levied at fixed amounts that may be slightly in excess of 0.1 percent. There is a third, informal and illegal foreign exchange market; in addition to unauthorized transactions, this market handles transactions not effected in the other two exchange markets because of restrictions and administra- tive rationing. The exchange rate in this third market fluctuates according to market forces and averaged <£ 6.65 = US$1 at the end of December 1985. On November 6, 1946 El Salvador notified the Fund that it was prepared to formally accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control Subject to the general directives issued by the Mone- tary Board, exchange control authority is exercised by the Central Reserve Bank through its Exchange Control Department. Prior authorization by the Exchange Con- trol Department of the Central Reserve Bank is required for all payments through the official market and for all requests of payment for imports and invisibles included in the "G" list,3 eligible for parallel market financing. Authority to approve most payments through the parallel market is delegated to the commercial banks, the Mortgage Bank, the BFA and the BANAFI. Exports of a number of commodities require licenses issued by the Ministry of Economy, subject to agreement by the Ministry of Agriculture. Since January 30, 1980 exports of two major commodities have been under government supervision. Exports of sugar are governed by the Instituto Nacional de Azucar (INAZUCAR), and those of coffee are governed by the Instituto Nacional de Cafe (INCAFE). Prescription of Currency Payments to other member countries of the Central American Common Market (CACM)4 in respect of trade and specified invisibles must be settled in the currencies of those countries or in Salvadoran colones through the Central American Clearing House. Payments to Mexico are also settled through a clearing house. Otherwise, residents are free to make authorized payments in any currency they choose. Nonresident Accounts Accredited diplomatic missions and other foreign institutions or persons established in El Salvador may hold nonresident accounts in foreign currency with authorized banks, provided that such accounts are credited with foreign exchange received from abroad. Banks may also freely open foreign currency accounts, for any period of time and in any amount, in the names of individuals (whether of foreign or Salvadoran nation- ality) who reside abroad and, for a maximum period of six months, in the names of foreign persons residing in El Salvador for less than six months. All nonresident accounts may be utilized freely, but the commercial banks must make periodic reports to the Central Reserve Bank of the movements on such accounts. Foreign Currency Deposit Accounts Foreign currency deposit accounts may be opened only by exporters of specified nontraditional products, industrial enterprises exporting part of their products to countries outside the CACM, certain individuals with receipts from foreign companies, tourism, as well as staff of embassies, consulates, and international organ- izations. Transfers of funds between foreign currency l The buying and selling rates in the parallel market fluctuated around £ 4 . 85 per US$1 at the end of December 1985. 2Including exporters of specified nontraditional products, industrial enterprises that export part of their production to destinations outside the Central American Common Market (CACM), individuals with income from tourism, foreign companies, embassies, and international organizations. 3 List "G" contains import items that are considered to be of low priority by the Government. Import items contained in this list are eligible for f inanc ing by the commercial banks at the parallel exchange rate, but the commercial banks are instructed to honor such requests only after the demand for imports of essential items through the parallel market has been met. 4Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. 213 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution EL SALVADOR deposit accounts are prohibited; balances in such ac- counts can be used for conversion into colones through sales to the banks at the parallel market rate, for payment for imports of goods and services, or for expenses for foreign travel, family maintenance abroad, education, medical treatment, personal insurance premiums, and other personal needs, subject to prior approval by the Central Reserve Bank. The accounts may be opened in U.S. dollars or in any other approved foreign currency; transactions can be effected only in the currency in which an account is opened. Accounts may be in the form of a demand or time deposit and are subject to a reserve requirement of 10 percent. The banks must place the funds thus deposited in investments abroad, provided that the maturity of investments does not exceed 30 days for demand deposits and that the maturity of investments from time deposits is the same as the maturity of the time deposit. The banks are required to pay interest on the time deposits at rates of up to 2 percent below LIBOR. Imports and Import Payments Certain imports, such as automobiles with an engine size of over 2,000 cubic centimeters or priced at more than US$14,000, certain other motor vehicles and motorcycles, buses, recreational vehicles, airplanes, pleasure boats, and other vessels not used for fishing are prohibited. Import licenses are issued by the Ministry of Economy and are required for only a few items, including airplanes, firearms, ammunition, military equipment, dynamite, cotton for industrial use, ju te sacks, skins, leather, some chemical and pharmaceutical products, coffee for seeding, sugar, and saccharin. Imports valued at US$2,000 or more from all coun- tries must be registered with the Central Reserve Bank before orders are placed. Orders for imports eligible for foreign exchange financing through the official market and requests for the import of items contained in list "G" that are eligible for financing in the parallel market must be approved by the Exchange Control Department, while approval for other imports through the parallel market is delegated to the commercial banks and the Mortgage Bank. Only items considered as priority imports may be paid for through the official market.5 Imports of all consumer goods (other than certain food items and medicines), which represent about 30 percent of the total value of imports, may be paid for only through the parallel market. Furthermore, 100 percent of imports of most intermediate goods must be settled at the parallel rate. Imports from countries outside the CACM that apply discriminatory restrictions against exports from El Sal- vador must be paid for before customs clearance, with the exception of industrial raw materials, which may be paid for within three years (medicines from Mexico may be paid for within 90 days; this applies also to imports of 5These include fue l, basic food items, medicines, medical and surgical equipment, certain agricultural imports, and certain capital goods. 214 spare parts from Mexico by importers who are regarded as small enterprises). Under the provisions of the Central American Agree- ment on Fiscal Incentives, El Salvador grants duty exonerations on imports of raw materials and capital goods to approved industrial firms. Imports originating outside the CACM are subject to an import surcharge of 30 percent of the applicable import duty; the surcharge is not applied to certain industrial equipment and raw materials that are free of duty under the Industrial Incentive Law. Many nones- sential goods are subject to a selective consumption tax, at rates of 5, 10, 20, 25, or 30 percent. Goods of Central American origin are exempt. There has been an accumulation of arrears on pay- ments for private sector imports. Payments for Invisibles Most payments for invisibles, except for certain student expenses, official travel, and payments of inter- est and dividends on registered capital, are prohibited in the official market and must be settled in the parallel market. All requests for invisible payments contained in the "G" list, including foreign travel expenses that are eligible for financing at the parallel market rate, require prior approval by the Central Bank; nonresident holders of foreign currency deposit accounts are exempted from this prior approval requirement. Students registered with the Central Reserve Bank prior to November 30, 1981 for university, postgraduate, or technical training abroad may purchase foreign exchange in the official market up to the equivalent of US$300 a month for living expenses and up to a maximum of US$5,000 a year for educa- tional expenses until the end of 1985. Students with public sector scholarships awarded as of June 17, 1985 may also purchase foreign exchange in the official market up to the amounts specified in the scholarships. With prior approval of the Central Bank, the commer- cial banks and the Mortgage Bank are permitted to sell foreign exchange in the parallel market for payments for invisible transactions of a personal nature (i.e., study abroad, foreign travel, medical care, family assistance, and insurance fees) within the following limits: (a) up to US$2,000 a trip to countries outside Central America for each person over 12 years of age (one half of the amount for children under 12 years), with a limit of two trips a year; (b) up to a limit of US$500 a trip to countries in Central America, with an annual limit of US$3,000; and (c) up to US$2,000 a year for personal expenses, such as family maintenance and insurance premiums. Additional amounts for foreign travel and family remittances can be sold to meet bona fide requirements; there is no limit on the amount that can be sold to meet expenses for medical treatment and study abroad. There are arrears on private sector payments for certain invisibles. Exports and Export Proceeds Export licenses are not required except for certain foodstuffs and other items for which the authorities wish ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution to ensure an adequate local supply. An export registra- tion certificate from the Central Reserve Bank is required for all exports exceeding US$200. Proceeds from tradi- tional exports (coffee, cotton, sugar, shrimp) must be received through a bank in El Salvador. With regard to traditional exports, the following authorizations are in effect for sales at the parallel market rate: (a) up to US$90 million of the proceeds from coffee; (b) up to US$17.5 million of sugar exports to the U .S. quota market and all the proceeds from sugar exports to the world market; (c) all the proceeds from cotton exports; and (d) all the proceeds from the export of shrimp and prawns. All proceeds from nontraditional exports to the Central American region may be sold in the parallel market, with the exception of proceeds from exports of medicines, fertilizers, fungicides, insecticides, herbi- cides, and other goods involving imported inputs that are payable 100 percent through the official market. All proceeds from exports to countries outside the Central American region may be sold at the parallel rate. Exporters of nontraditional products are required to use funds in their special foreign currency accounts or to purchase foreign exchange in the parallel market to effect payments for their own imports of goods and services. Export transactions exceeding US$200 must be de- clared to the Exchange Control Department before shipment. The collection term normally must not exceed 90 days, but longer credit terms may be authorized by the Exchange Control Department. Exports of coffee and sugar are subject to an export tax. Proceeds from Invisibles All exchange receipts from invisibles must be surren- dered to the Central Reserve Bank or an authorized commercial bank. Receipts from personal transfers, and by representatives of foreign companies, resident indi- viduals, corporate entities, and from tourism must be sold to the commercial banks and the Mortgage Bank in the parallel market. All proceeds.from services involving transportation, investment, government services, insur- ance, reinsurance, and other service exports are trans- acted at the parallel market rate, with the exception of remittances received by the Government for services rendered by embassies and consulates accredited abroad and interest received by the public sector and the banking system. Receipts from personal transfers may be depos- ited in special foreign currency accounts only in the name of the beneficiaries. Embassies, consulates, and offices of international organizations in El Salvador and their employees are allowed to sell their foreign receipts to commercial banks and the Mortgage Bank at the parallel exchange rate or deposit such receipts in the special foreign currency accounts in their names for purposes of meeting their foreign exchange require- ments. Travelers may bring in <£. 200 in domestic notes and coin. This limit is subject to modification, however, to facilitate border trade with other Central American countries. EL SALVADOR Capital All exchange receipts resulting from capital transac- tions must be surrendered to the monetary authorities, except all private capital inflows which are permitted to be transacted at the parallel rate, including direct and indirect international investment, inflows pertaining to repatriated investments registered on or after Febru- ary 19, 1983, inflows from loans registered on or after June 17, 1985, and inflows of other foreign assets and liabilities registered on or after June 17, 1985. The entry of capital with a maturity in excess of one year in the form of foreign investment must be registered with the Ministry of Economy. Registration ensures (1) free remittance of net profits on foreign capital invested in industrial enterprises, enterprises engaged in the extrac- tion of nonrenewable natural resources, and tourist enterprises; (2) the remittance of net profits of enterprises engaged in other activities up to a limit of 10 percent a year of the registered capital (larger amounts may be authorized in special cases by the Ministry of Economy); (3) repatriation of the proceeds from the total or partial liquidation of the enterprise (after payment of taxes) in proportion to the participation of foreign capital in the total capital; (4) remittance of the sales proceeds of shares and other instruments representing investments or participations, including capital gains; and (5) payment of interest and amortization as determined at the time of registration. In the cases under (3) and (4), in addition to the approval of the Exchange Control Department, the prior approval of the Ministry of Economy is required. Foreign investments made in El Salvador prior to June 1, 1961 must also be registered with the Ministry of Economy or the Exchange Control Department. Payments abroad representing capital movements re- quire exchange licenses; such licenses are not granted for resident-owned capital. Prior approval by the Exchange Control Department is required for outward remittances of interest and amortization on short-term loans from abroad through the official market; foreign loans with a maturity of up to one year must be authorized by the Central Reserve Bank; foreign loans with a maturity of more than one year must be authorized by the Ministry of Economy. Payments related to repatriation of foreign investment and dividends must be settled through the parallel exchange market. Decree No. 279 of March 27, 1969 sets certain minimum capital requirements for businesses that are owned by foreign nationals and for those in which foreign nationals have a shareholding interest. For purposes of this decree, foreign nationals are defined as persons who are not citizens of one of the five CACM member countries. Gold Gold coins in denominations of <£ 25, <£ 50, <£ 100, and <£ 200 have been issued as legal tender, but do not circulate. Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in El Salvador for numismatic purposes. With this 215 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution EL SALVADOR exception, residents other than the monetary authorities are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Central Reserve Bank; such licenses are granted for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. In practice, imports of nonmonetary unworked gold are made only by jewelers' cooperatives acting on behalf of their members and other users. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement August 24. The National Assembly delegated full authority to the Monetary Board in the conduct of exchange rate policy. Imports and Import Payments June 12. With effect from June 17, 1985, financing for the full c .i .f. value of imports of most intermediate goods was transferred to the parallel market.

The exchange restriction aspect of the advance deposit requirement on certain import payments was abolished. Exports and Export Proceeds February 27. A requirement was introduced that, with effect from March 4, 1985, 70 percent of proceeds from nontraditional exports to Central American countries (other than those from exports of medicines, fertilizers, and insecticides and their inputs) could be sold in the parallel market; previously, the applicable rate was 50 percent. March 13. Authorization was granted for the Associa- tion of Cotton Producers (COPAL) to sell all their cotton exports from the harvest of 1984/85 and 1985/86 at the parallel market rate.

With effect from June 17, 1985, the proportion of the foreign exchange proceeds from ex- ports of shrimp and prawns that could be sold in the parallel market was increased from 80 percent to 100 percent. 216 June 12. With effect from June 17, 1985, the proportion of foreign exchange proceeds from exports to the Central American region that could be sold in the parallel market was increased from 70 percent to 100 percent. Excluded from this coverage were foreign exchange proceeds from exports of fertilizers, fun- gicides, insecticides, herbicides, medicines, and other goods involving imported inputs that are payable 100 percent through the official market; such proceeds were to be sold in the official market. June 12. One hundred percent of the foreign exchange proceeds from exports of nontraditional exports to countries outside the Central American region was authorized to be sold in the parallel market. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles June 12. Changes were made as follows in regulations affecting invisible transactions: (a) the conversion of all foreign exchange proceeds from services involving transportation, international travel, international invest- ment, government services, insurance, reinsurance, and other service exports were transferred to the parallel market, with the exception of remittances received by the Government for services rendered by embassies and consulates accredited abroad and interest received by the public sector and the banking sector; (b) the exchange restriction aspect of the 100 percent advance deposit requirement on requests for official foreign exchange for medical treatment abroad was abolished; and (c) requests for invisible payments abroad contained in the "G" list, including foreign travel expenses, that were eligible for financing at the parallel market rate were made sub- ject to prior approval by the Central Bank.

Not for Redistribution EQUATORIAL GUINEA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Equatorial Guinea is the CFA Franc,l which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. Exchange transactions in French francs between the BEAC and commercial banks take place at the rate of CFAF 50 = F 1, free of commission. Buying and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also offi- cially posted, with quotations based on the fixed rate for the French franc and the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market. A commission of 0.50 percent is levied on transfers to countries that are not members of the BEAC, except transfers in respect of central and local Government operations, payments for imports covered by a duly issued license domiciled with a bank, scheduled repayments on loans properly ob- tained abroad, travel allowances paid by the Government and its agencies for official missions, and payments of reinsurance premiums. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of those relating to gold, Equato- rial Guinea's exchange control measures generally do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Burkina Faso, Came- roon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Cote d'lvoire, Gabon, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely, but all financial transfers in excess of CFAF 500,000 to countries of the French Franc Area must be declared to the authorities for statistical purposes. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Directorate General of Exchange Control (ONCC) in the Ministry of Finance. Exchange transactions relating to all countries must be effected through authorized intermediaries, that is, authorized banks. Import and export licenses are issued by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Prescription of Currency As Equatorial Guinea is an Operations Account country, settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury. Settlements with all other countries are usually made through correspondent l fThe CFA franc circulating in Equatorial Guinea is issued by the Banque des Etats de 1'Afrique Centrale (BEAC) and is legal tender also in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, and Gabon. banks in France in any of the currencies of those countries or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. The principal nonresi- dent accounts are Foreign Accounts in Francs. BEAC bank notes received by the foreign correspondents of authorized banks and mailed to the BEAC agency in Equatorial Guinea by the Bank of France or the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de TOuest (BCEAO) may be credited freely to Foreign Accounts in France. Imports and Import Payments All import transactions must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value exceeds CFAF 50,000. Import transactions by residents involving goods for use outside Equatorial Guinea must be domiciled with a bank in the country of final destination. Settlements for imports effected under an import license benefit from the authorization of uninterrupted transfer given to the authorized banks by the Ministry of Finance. Payments for Invisibles Payments in excess of CFAF 500,000 for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries require prior declaration but are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to the approval of the Ministry of Finance. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted freely when the basic transaction has been approved. For tourist travel, resi- dents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may obtain an exchange allocation of an amount equiva- lent to CFAF 200,000 a person a year; any foreign exchange remaining after return to Equatorial Guinea must be surrendered. For business travel, the corre- sponding allocation is the equivalent of CFAF 15,000 a day, subject to a maximum of CFAF 450,000 a trip. CFAF 150,000 of that amount may be bills; travelers must present certificates of their activity and permission by enterprise to travel. Additional allocations may be allowed. The transfer of rent from real property owned in Equatorial Guinea by foreign nationals is permitted up to a limit equivalent to 50 percent of the income declared for taxation purposes, net of tax. Remittances for current repair and management of real property abroad are to be limited to the equivalent of CFAF 200,000 every two or three years. The amount of transfer of the salary of a 217 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution EQUATORIAL GUINEA foreigner working in Equatorial Guinea will be permitted upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher as well as justification of expenses, provided that the transfer takes place within a month of the pay period concerned. Except in the case of foreigners working in Equatorial Guinea temporarily, payments of insurance premiums to foreign countries up to CFAF 50,000 are permitted; larger amounts may be authorized by the ONCC. Resident and nonresident travelers to countries outside the French Franc Area may take out up to CFAF 20,000 in BEAC bank notes. Travelers to other countries of the French Franc Area may, subject to prior declaration, take out any amount in BEAC banknotes. Nonresident travelers may take out bank notes and up to the amount declared by them on entry, or up to CFAF 50,000 if no declaration was made. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. Export transactions valued at CFAF 50,000 or more must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Exports to all countries are subject to domiciliation requirements for the appropriate documents. Proceeds from exports to all countries must be repatriated within 30 days of the payment date stipulated in the sales contract. Payments for exports must be made within 30 days from the arrival date of the merchandise at its destination. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services, and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets, must be collected within a month of the due date and surrendered within a month of collection if received in foreign currency. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BEAC, the Bank of France, or a bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) of countries outside the French Franc Area. Capital Capital movements between Equatorial Guinea and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are free of exchange control. Capital transfers to all other countries require exchange control approval and are restricted, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted free ly .2 Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold jewelry in Equatorial Guinea. They require the approval of the Directorate of Mines to hold gold in any other form. Such approval is normally given only to industrial users, including jewelers. Newly mined gold must be declared to the Directorate of Mines, which authorizes either its exportation or its sale to domestic industrial users; exports are made only to France. Imports and exports of gold require prior authorization by the Directorate of Mines and the Minister of Finance, which is seldom granted for imports. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, and (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles). Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Changes During 1985 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. Regulations on capital transactions, such as the sale of foreign securities in Equatorial Guinea or direct investments, have been prepared and are pending approval. The authorities are also in the process of drafting legislation aimed at stimulating foreign investment in the agricultural, forestry, construction, public works, mining, and industrial equipment maintenance sectors. 218 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ETHIOPIA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Ethiopia is the Ethiopian Birr, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at the official rate of Br 2.07 = US$1. Buying and selling rates for certain other currencies are also officially posted; daily quotations by the National Bank of Ethiopia (the central bank) are set on the basis of the official rate for the U .S. dollar and the previous day's closing rate of the currency concerned against the U.S. dollar in London. The National Bank does not deal with the public; its transactions in U .S. dollars with the authorized dealers take place at the official rate. Autho- rized dealers must observe the official rate for the U.S. dollar and prescribed commission charges, which accrue to the National Bank, of 0.50 percent buying and 1.50 percent selling; in addition, they are authorized, but not obliged, to levy service charges for their own account of up to 0.25 percent buying and 0.75 percent selling and, for currencies other than the U.S. dollar, to include the margin charges applied by the correspon- dents abroad. In practice, the authorized charges are usually levied. These commissions are applied also to the National Bank's dealings with the Government and certain public sector entities. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Authorized dealers require the approval of the National Bank to undertake forward exchange transactions. Administration of Control All transactions in foreign exchange must be carried out through authorized dealers under the control of the National Bank. All payments abroad require licenses issued by the Exchange Controller, whose office is a division of the National Bank. All exports are licensed by the Exchange Controller to ensure the surrender of the foreign exchange proceeds, and shipments require per- mits issued by that office. The Minister of Foreign Trade has statutory authority to prohibit, restrict, or regulate imports and exports. Prescription of Currency Outgoing payments are normally made in convertible foreign exchange appropriate to the country of ^the recipient or in U .S. dollars. The net proceeds of exports must be received in a foreign currency that is freely convertible, or in any other acceptable foreign currency. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents may, subject to exchange control ap- proval, open nonresident accounts either in birr or in foreign currencies at authorized banks. Deposits to these accounts can only be made in foreign exchange. Bal- ances on nonresident foreign currency accounts may be freely transferred abroad. Transfers between nonresident accounts do not require prior approval. Members of the diplomatic community must use transferable or nontrans- ferable birr accounts for payments of local expenses. No resident Ethiopian national may maintain a bank account abroad. A joint venture may be permitted to open foreign currency, transferable or nontransferable, birr accounts for the purchase of raw materials, equipment, and spare parts not available in the local market. As soon as the goods are received, documentary evidence of entry of the goods purchased with such funds must be submitted to the Exchange Control Division. In general, the accounts may only be replenished after such documents have been presented. Blocked accounts of nonresidents are maintained with authorized banks and are used to retain funds in excess of Br 20,000 arising from disinvestments in Ethiopia (see section on Capital, below). Imports and Import Payments All imports from South Africa are prohibited. Pay- ments abroad for imports require exchange licenses, which are obtainable upon presentation of a valid importer's license. Approval of applications for ex- change licenses is conditional upon the provision of satisfactory information on costs and payment terms and the submission of evidence that adequate insurance has been arranged with the Ethiopian Insurance Corpora- tion, particularly for goods imported under letters of credit. Foreign exchange is not made available for a specified range of imported goods (including alcoholic beverages and certain durable consumer goods) consid- ered to be nonessential or readily substitutable by domestic products. Imports of cars and other vehicles require prior authorization by the Minister of Transport. Exchange licenses are granted in the currency appropri- ate to the country of origin, or in any convertible currency that may be requested. Payments by letter of credit, mail transfer, telegraphic transfer, or cash against documents at sight are all normally acceptable, but the National Bank must be consulted regarding imports on a cash against documents basis. Goods that were prev- iously subject to advance deposit requirements (about 100 items, mostly consumer goods) may not be financed on an acceptance basis, and virtually no imports take place on this basis. Importation on suppliers' credit is prohibited except for goods such as raw and intermediate materials, Pharmaceuticals, and machinery and transport equipment, in which case prior approval of the terms and conditions of the credit is required. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles require exchange licenses. Invisibles connected with trade transactions are treated on the same basis as the goods to which they relate. Foreign employees may remit monthly up to 30 percent 219 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ETHIOPIA of their net earnings (but only for the first three years of their contract if employed by the private sector); they may remit a maximum ranging between 40 percent and 50 percent of total net earnings during the period of service and upon final departure. Other expatriate em- ployees may on final departure take out the same maximum amount, but not more than Br 20,000 in any one year. Foreign nationals who are not entitled to remittance facilities may, however, remit up to 30 per- cent of their net earnings for the education of their children. Persons traveling abroad are allowed foreign exchange equivalent to Br 125 a day for a maximum period of 30 days in any one calendar year if the journey is made for business purposes; for tourism, persons 18 years of age or over are allowed up to the equivalent of Br 600 a year. Students are allowed foreign exchange up to the equivalent of Br 500 for study abroad, and Ethiopian nationals having dependents pursuing higher studies in accredited institutions abroad are allowed to remit funds to meet school fees and reasonable expenses. Residents may remit premiums on insurance policies taken out before April 1962. Subject to certain limits and to submission of evidence, persons may obtain foreign exchange for medical treatment and travel abroad. After providing for payment of local taxes, foreign companies may, in principle, remit dividends on their invested and reinvested capital in any currency. Travelers may take with them a maximum of Br 10 in Ethiopian bank notes. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. Exports of most cereals to any destination other than Djibouti also are prohibited. Exports of horsebeans are suspended. All commodity exports require permits from the Exchange Controller and some require, in addition, the approval of specified public bodies. When applying for a permit, an exporter must specify the goods to be exported, the destination, and the value. For exports on a c . i . f. basis, exporters must obtain full insurance from the Ethiopian Insurance Corporation. The granting of a permit by the Exchange Controller enables the goods to pass through customs. The licensing system is used to ensure that foreign exchange receipts are surrendered to the National Bank, generally within three months, and that export proceeds are received in an appropriate currency (see section on Prescription of Currency, above). Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange receipts from invisibles must be surrendered. Travelers may bring in Br 10 in Ethiopian currency. Foreign exchange must be declared by travel- ers on entry, and its re-export is subject to authorization, except for temporary visitors. Reconversion of birr must be supported by documentary evidence of prior exchange of foreign currency. Capital Controls over capital movements are designed to restrict outflows, to preclude an unwarranted accumula- 220 tion of external debt, and to keep the authorities informed of the country's external debt position. All receipts of capital in the form of foreign exchange must be surrendered. Exchange control authorization is required, and registration of capital inflows with the exchange control authorities establishes evidence of receipt, which is required for repatriation. All recog- nized and registered foreign investments may be termi- nated on presentation of documents regarding liquidation and payment of all taxes and other liabilities. Subject to appropriate documentation, foreign businessmen having nonregistered investments may transfer their capital abroad on liquidation and final departure from Ethiopia, but may not transfer more than Br 20,000 in any one calendar year; funds in excess of this amount must be deposited in a blocked account with an authorized bank. (This regulation does not apply to joint ventures estab- lished under the new foreign investment code.) Transfers by emigrants who had operated their own businesses are restricted to Br 20,000 in any one calendar year. Joint ventures are permitted between the Ethiopian public sector and foreign investors, with up to 49 percent foreign ownership, except in the precious metals, public utilities, telecommunications, banking and insurance, transport, and domestic trade sectors. All applications for joint ventures must be approved by the Office of the National Committee for Central Planning and registered with the Domestic Trade Ministry; a minimum of 25 percent of share capital is required to be paid before registration. Exemptions from income taxes are granted for up to five years for new projects, and for up to three years for extensions to existing projects. Imports of investment goods and spare parts for such ventures are also eligible for exemptions from customs duties and other specified import levies. Such ventures must be limited to 25 years in duration, but could be extended beyond this limit with the approval of the Council of Ministers. Borrowing abroad requires exchange control approval and is restricted. Authorized banks may freely place their funds abroad, except on fixed-term deposit, but they may not acquire securities denominated in foreign currency without the permission of the National Bank. In addi- tion, they need the prior approval of the National Bank to overdraw their accounts with foreign correspondents, to borrow funds abroad, or to accept deposits in foreign currency. Gold The ownership of personal jewelry of which gold or platinum forms a part is permitted. Unless specifically authorized by the Minister of Mines, Energy, and Water Resources, the possession or custody of 50 ounces or more of raw or refined gold or platinum, or of gold or platinum in the form of nuggets, ores, or bullion, is not permitted. Newly mined gold is sold by the Ethiopian Mineral Resources Development Corporation to the National Bank. Imports and exports of gold in any form ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution other than jewelry require exchange licenses issued by the National Bank. Such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities. Changes During 1985 Payments for Invisibles January 24. A regulation was introduced, specifying the foreign exchange allowance for business travel as the equivalent of B 125 a person a day, for a maximum period of 20 days. August 1.

Not for Redistribution FIJI (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Fiji is the Fiji Dollar, the value of which is determined on the basis of the fixed relationship between the Fiji dollar and a weighted basket of currencies of Fiji's most important trading partners. The exchange rate of the Fiji dollar in terms of the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, is fixed daily on the basis of quotations for the U .S. dollar and other currencies included in the basket. On December 31, 1985 the midpoint exchange for the Fiji dollar in terms of the U .S. dollar was F$ 1.1204 = US$1. The Reserve Bank of Fiji provides official quotations only for the U.S. dollar. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. On August 4, 1972 Fiji formally accepted the obliga- tions of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Reserve Bank of Fiji, acting as agent of the Government; the Bank delegates to authorized dealers the authority to approve normal import payments. Except with the specific permission of the Reserve Bank, residents of Fiji are required to offer for sale to an authorized dealer all foreign currencies they receive.1 The Ministry of Eco- nomic Development is responsible for the issue of import licenses, with the exception of those for gold, timber, rice, and dairy products. Import licenses for gold are issued by the Ministry of Finance, for timber by the Ministry of Forestry, and for rice and dairy products by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. Export licenses are issued by the Comptroller of Customs. Prescription of Currency Transactions with all countries are subject to exchange control. Settlements with residents of any country may be made in Fiji currency through an External Account or in any foreign currency. Payments for exports to any destination outside Fiji may be made in Fiji currency from an External Account or in any foreign currency. Nonresident Accounts A nonresident2 may maintain an External Account in Fiji currency or a Foreign Currency Account with an authorized bank; such accounts may be opened without the specific approval of the Reserve Bank of Fiji. These accounts may be credited freely with interest payable on the account, with payments from other External Ac- 1 Under Fiji's Exchange Control Regulations, foreign currencies are all currencies other than the Fiji dollar. 2 A nonresident is a person or firm whose country of normal domicile or established residence is a country other than Fiji.

External Accounts also may be credited with payments by residents for which either a general or a specific authority has been given. External Accounts may be debited for payments to residents of Fiji, transfers to other External Accounts, payments in cash in Fiji, and purchases of foreign exchange. Imports and Import Payments Imports of most goods are under open general license, although imports of a range of specified goods, including tea, mild steel bars, steel shelving and racking, tubes and pipes of iron or steel, certain foodstuffs, alcoholic beverages, kerosene stoves, safety matches, seed potatoes, poly vinyl chloride pipes, PVC-insulated elec- tric wires and wiring pin clips, polypropylene bags and ropes, louver window frames, shirts, wood screws, and incense sticks and chemicals used as raw materials in their manufacture, are subject to individual import licensing; licenses for some of these items are issued restrictively. There is a wide range of consumer goods imported by national cooperative societies under a joint arrangement with six other Pacific Island countries. Import prohibitions are imposed on a few commodities from all sources, mainly for security, health, or public policy reasons. Payments for authorized imports are permitted upon application and submission of documentary evidence to authorized dealers who may allow payments for goods which have been imported under either a specific import license or an open general license. Authorized banks may allow advance payments for all imports, provided that the goods are imported into Fiji within 90 days of the date the payment is made. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles are permitted either under a delegated authority to banks or, where large amounts or nondelegated payments are involved, upon application to the Reserve Bank of Fiji. Payments may be made freely for all bona fide current transactions. Residents of Fiji traveling to other countries may obtain from a bank, without reference to the Reserve Bank, a foreign currency travel allowance for private or business visit up to the equivalent of F$2,000 a person a journey. For an extended visit, a traveler may apply before his departure to the Reserve Bank of Fiji for funds in excess of F$2,000 a person; applications may also be made from abroad through the traveler's bank. There is no restric- tion on the number of trips a resident may make in any one year. Each traveler may take with him F$100 in Fiji ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution currency and the equivalent of F$500 in other currencies, provided that these amounts are not in addition to travel allowances approved by a bank or the Reserve Bank of Fiji. Exports and Export Proceeds Specific licenses are required only for exports of rice, sugar, wheat bran, copra meal, certain lumber, scrap metals, certain animals, and a few other items. Irrespec- tive of any export licensing requirements, however, exporters are required to produce an export permit for commercial consignment of all goods with an f .o .b. value exceeding F$ 1,000; this permit is required for exchange control purposes. Exporters are required to collect the proceeds of exports within six months of the date of exportation of the goods from Fiji, and may not grant credit to a nonresident buyer in excess of six months without specific permission. All foreign curren- cies must be offered for sale to an authorized dealer within one month of receipt. Proceeds from Invisibles All receipts from invisibles must be surrendered to authorized dealers. Travelers may bring in freely any amount in Fiji notes or foreign currency notes. Residents are required to sell their foreign currency holdings to an authorized dealer within one month of return. Capital The inflow of capital in any form requires specific permission of the Reserve Bank of Fiji. Foreign invest- ment in Fiji normally is expected to be financed from a nonresident source. Such foreign investment may be given "approved status," which guarantees the right to repatriate dividends and capital. All capital outflows are subject to prior approval. Capital transfers by residents to finance direct investments require the specific permis- sion of the Reserve Bank of Fiji and are permitted only where benefits will accrue to Fiji within a reasonably short period. Authority is delegated to banks operating in Fiji to approve transactions involving F$50,000 or more arising from (1) the conversion of foreign currency into Fiji currency, whether for credit to a resident account or to an External Account, and (2) the crediting of an External Account with Fiji currency emanating from another External Account (including Fiji currency accounts of overseas banks). The banks must send confirmation of such inflows to the Reserve Bank; they must also have the approval of the Bank before granting any loans in excess of F$ 10,000 to a company or branch in Fiji (other than a bank) which is controlled directly or indirectly by persons resident outside Fiji or by individuals designated as nonresidents; however, the banks do not need such approval to lend up to F$l0,000 to individual nonresi- FIJI dent customers who must repay such loans prior to their departure from Fiji. The banks may not lend foreign currency to any resident of Fiji without the specific permission of the Reserve Bank of Fiji. Residents require permission from the Reserve Bank of Fiji before they may borrow foreign currency within Fiji or outside. The transfer of inheritances and dowries due to nonresidents is permitted, as is the transfer of the proceeds from the sale of a house owned by a nonresi- dent. Residents of Fiji are allowed to make cash gifts to nonresidents equivalent to F$500 a donor a year; additional funds are permitted in compassionate cases. Emigrants may take out their entire net assets on departure. With the prior approval of the Reserve Bank, residents are permitted to purchase foreign currency up to a maximum of F$5,000 a family a year to acquire foreign currency securities. The purchase of personal real prop- erty outside Fiji is not permitted. Special tax incentives are granted for investments in the tourist industry, and an investment allowance similar to that for the hotel industry is provided for large outlay investment projects supportive of the tourist industry. Portfolio investment in Fiji by nonresidents requires approval by the Reserve Bank; the proceeds of the sale or realization of such investment may be repatriated. Banks require exchange control permission to borrow abroad; they may accept deposits from nonresidents. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold coin in Fiji but not gold bullion. The export of gold coin, except numismatic coins and collectors' pieces, requires the specific permission of the Reserve Bank of Fiji. Gold imports from all sources, other than imports of gold coin, require a specific import license issued by the Ministry of Finance; these are restricted to authorized gold dealers. Gold coin is free of customs duty and fiscal tax, while gold bullion is exempt from customs duty but is subject to a fiscal tax of 7.5 percent. Gold jewelry is subject to customs duty at the rate of 7.5 percent and to a fiscal duty of 20 percent but does not require any license when valued at less than F$200; samples of gold and gold jewelry sent by foreign manufacturers require import licenses if over F$200 in value. Exports of gold jewelry do not require licenses and are free of export duty. All newly mined gold is refined in Australia and sold at free market prices. Commemora- tive gold coins of F$100, F$200, and F$250 have been issued; these are legal tender but do not normally circulate. Changes During 1985 Imports and Import Payments At various times during the year the list of goods subject to import licensing was expanded, by a total of 6 items, bringing the total to 48 items. The new items 223 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FIJI included butter, canned mackerel, wet cell batteries, prawns, onions, certain types of roofing materials, and multiwall paper bags. In the case of roofing materials, imports were banned to prevent the importation of substandard products used in cyclone-proofing of the buildings; the ban was scheduled to be lifted after the introduction of a national code laying down minimum standards for building materials. 224 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FINLAND (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Finland is the Finnish Markka. The external value of the markka is defined in terms of an index reflecting a weighted average of the exchange rates of the convertible currencies most important for Fin- land's foreign trade. These are defined as the convertible currencies of countries that have accounted for not less than 1 percent of Finland's commodity imports and exports in each of the preceding three calendar years. The value of the exchange rate index is maintained by the Suomen Pankki within a margin established by the Council of State; since January 1984 the range has been 101.3-106.0 (1982 = 100). The actual level of the index has been in the range of 102.3-102.7 since March 1984. The index weights are adjusted quarterly and based on the average trade shares for the past two years; the base year is changed annually. The Suomen Pankki calculates and publishes the currency index on a daily basis. Daily (noon) buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, are quoted by the Suomen Pankki. On December 31, 1985 the rates were Fmk 5.4090 and Fmk 5.4250 per US$1, respectively. The rates for the U .S. dollar are applicable also to clearing dollars. Buying and selling rates for the clearing ruble are based on the rates of the State Bank of the U .S .S .R. for the U.S. dollar against the ruble. Quota- tions for other currencies are based on market cross rates. There are no exchange taxes or subsidies. Authorized banks may deal among themselves, with residents, and with nonresident banks in U .S. dollars and other convertible currencies. Forward premiums and discounts quoted by authorized banks reflect interest rate differences in various currencies. Finland formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from September 25, 1979. Administration of Control The Suomen Pankki operates the exchange control system, delegating authority to the authorized banks (mainly commercial banks). Import and export licensing is administered by the Export and Import Permits Office (a unit subordinate to the Ministry of Trade and Industry), which is headed by a Board composed of government officials, including a representative of the Suomen Pankki. Prescription of Currency For prescription of currency purposes, countries are divided into two groups: the bilateral countries1 and the convertible currency countries (all others). Settlements with the bilateral countries must be made in the currency of the agreement (the clearing ruble for the U .S .S .R ., the clearing U.S. dollar for Bulgaria, and the clearing Finnish markka for the German Democratic Republic). Settlements with the convertible currency countries may be made in any convertible currency or through Convert- ible Accounts. Nonresident Accounts There are three categories of nonresident accounts: Convertible Accounts, Restricted Accounts, and Capital Accounts.2 Convertible Accounts are held by nonresidents in Finnish markkaa or in convertible currencies. These accounts may be credited by an authorized bank with amounts transferred from other Convertible Accounts, with Finnish currency received directly from a foreign bank or imported into Finland, with amounts which the bank would be authorized to transfer abroad, with amounts of convertible currency received by the bank, and with interest accrued on funds held in the accounts. These accounts may be debited freely and balances may be transferred abroad to any country. Restricted Accounts are held by residents of countries with which Finland has bilateral payments arrangements, and are designated according to the holder's country of residence. They may be held in Finnish markkaa or the appropriate bilateral payments agreement currency. They may be credited by an authorized bank with amounts transferred from Convertible Accounts and from Restricted Accounts related to the same country. The accounts may also be credited with Finnish currency received from a bank in the country indicated on the account, with amounts that the bank is authorized to receive to the credit of a Restricted Account related to the country indicated on the account, with currency surrendered to the bank and restricted to the country indicated on the account, and with interest accrued on funds held in the accounts. These accounts may be debited freely and balances may be transferred to the bilateral country concerned. Capital Accounts comprise all other nonresident ac- counts. They are held in markkaa and are intended primarily for payments of a capital nature. The assign- ment of a Capital Account to another nonresident and the transfer abroad of funds held in such an account may be effected only with the permission of the Suomen Pankki. A monetary institution may credit a Capital Account with the purchase price of assets other than foreign Finland maintains bilateral payments agreements with Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, and the U.S.S.R. Transactions with Czechoslovakia and Poland have, how- ever, been settled in freely convertible U .S. dollars since 1970 under agreements reached separately for each year. Under an agreement concluded between Finland and Czechoslovakia in August 1985, the practice whereby transactions are settled in convertible currencies was extended for three years from the beginning of 1986; the payments arrangement is henceforth to be renewed automatically for three years, unless otherwise agreed subsequently. In addition, under an agreement concluded in December 1985 between Finland and Poland, payments may be effected in Finnish markkaa as well as in U .S. dollars. 2On January 6, 1986 the designation "capital account" was changed to "nonresident markka account," and "Restricted Accounts" were abolished, with the Suomen Pankki reserving the power to reintroduce them in case of need. 225 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FINLAND securities bought from the holder by a resident, with funds received as an inheritance, and with redemption payments and interest on matured bonds and debentures quoted on the Helsinki Stock Exchange. These accounts may also be credited with rent on property owned in Finland by the holder of the account, with proceeds from other assets belonging to the holder of the account and managed by the monetary institution with which the account is held, with the amount of a loan based on a contract granting to a nonresident a loan not exceeding Fmk 50,0003 in value to be utilized in Finland, and with interest accrued on funds held in the account. Capital Accounts may be debited freely for noncom- mercial current expenses in Finland of and for account of the holder, and funds in Capital Accounts may be used for capital payments when the transaction does not require authorization or is authorized for transferable funds. The Suomen Pankki generally grants permission for transfer abroad of funds deposited in Capital Ac- counts to an account holder who has resided abroad during the last calendar year and who continues to do so. Imports and Import Payments4 Most goods may be imported free of license from the multilateral countries, provided that the goods are purchased from and originate in those countries. How- ever, certain goods5 may be imported from the multila- teral area under a global quota system, which provides for import licenses to be issued at least up to the amounts of quotas for specified commodity groups. With the exception of the commodities to which reference was made in the preceding paragraph, import licenses are not required for most commodities originat- ing in and purchased from the U .S .S .R ., or originating in and purchased from the five countries with which agreements on the reciprocal removal of obstacles to trade have been concluded (Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, and Po- land). All imports of commodities originating in coun- tries or areas not classified6 in either the multilateral area or the bilateral area require individual licenses. The State Granary is the main agency for the import of wheat, rye, barley, oats, and products of these grains for human consumption, but individual importers may also import these commodities under license. There is a state monopoly for imports of alcoholic beverages. Exchange is granted by authorized banks for all per- mitted imports on presentation of an application form, the import license (when required for imports from coun- tries with nonconvertible currencies), and the original 3On January 1, 1986 the maximum permissible amount of loan to a nonresident under this facility was raised to Fmk 100,000. 4On January 1, 1986 the charging of an "overtime fee" for suppliers' credit exceeding six months was abolished, and the max imum maturity of suppliers' credit exempt from the special permission of Suomen Pankki was specified as six months. 5 Agricultural commodities, fish, fuels and other petroleum products, and unwrought gold and silver. 6Currently Taiwan (see Explanatory Note on coverage of Part Two, page 75) and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 226 commercial invoice, provided that the goods are already in the country or there is sufficient evidence to guarantee their importation. Payment for imports must be made within 12 months after the date of customs clearance of the goods; if the period of suppliers' credit exceeds 6 months, the credit is subject to an "overtime fee" (see footnote 4), unless specially authorized by the Suomen Pankki; if the import payment is made to the seller through foreign financing credit arranged by an autho- rized Finnish bank, the credit period may not exceed 6 months without a special permit. The Suomen Pankki applies nominal quotas on the authorized banks for this purpose. Payments for Invisibles Payments in respect of invisible transactions are not restricted. The authorized banks have general permission to effect payments for most invisibles, with a few exceptions relating to insurance, subject in some cases to a maximum allowance or other conditions. A Finnish resident traveling abroad may purchase from commercial banks foreign exchange equivalent to Fmk 10,000 a tr ip ,7 or, in the case of business travel, any amount made available by a bank for that purpose. Once abroad, a traveler may w i thdraw foreign exchange on a bank account passbook or check issued by a Finnish monetary institution, provided that the utilized amount of his travel allocation does not exceed a total of Fmk 10,000. A resident traveler may use a credit card abroad without a limit on amount for travel services and settle the transaction after his return. A credit card may also be used to buy merchandise, provided that the purchase price of each such item does not exceed Fmk 10,000. Nonresident travelers may take out Fmk 10,000 a trip in Finnish notes and coin and any amount in Finnish or foreign notes and coin declared upon entry; resident travelers may take out foreign or domestic currency, or any combination of these, up to Fmk 10,000, w i thout the special permission of the Suomen Pankki. For all types of travel, bona fide applications for additional amounts of foreign exchange are approved by the Suomen Pankki. Exports and Export Proceeds Sales of arms are strictly controlled. Exports to countries that are not in the convertible area and that are outside the scope of agreements on the reciprocal removal of obstacles to trade are allocated by means of bilateral trade arrangements. Foreign exchange acquired through commodity exports need not be surrendered to the Suomen Pankki or to an authorized exchange dealer. Exporters are required to repatriate foreign exchange proceeds within eight days of collection, which may then be held in a foreign currency account with an authorized 7On January 1, 1986 authorized banks were empowered to provide foreign exchange for travel without an upper l im i t, on the basis of a breakdown of costs drawn up by the purchaser. ©International Monetary Fund.

Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange receipts from current invisibles must be repatriated within eight days of collection. The funds may be held in a domestic foreign currency account in Finland. Any unutilized foreign bank notes and traveler's checks must be repatriated, but these are exempt from the repatriation requirement up to Fmk 10,000 for assets held in Finland. The import of domestic and foreign currency and coin is unrestricted. Capital* Most outward transfers of nonresident capital are subject to approval by the Suomen Pankki. Inheritances are transferred to the beneficiaries after verification. Persons who have resided outside Finland during the last calendar year and continue to do so are allowed to transfer abroad their assets in Finland in one lump sum, subject to the prior approval of the Suomen Pankki. Nonresidents may purchase shares quoted on the Helsinki Stock Exchange through an authorized bank, against convertible currencies, or by debiting a Convert- ible Account. When the securities so acquired by a nonresident are deposited in the custody of the autho- rized bank, the nonresident purchaser is permitted to sell the securities on the Helsinki Stock Exchange through the authorized bank and to repatriate the proceeds of the sale in a convertible currency. The acquisition of shares quoted on the Helsinki Stock Exchange with funds from Capital Accounts is also permitted automatically if they are acquired by an authorized bank, but proceeds from the sale of such securities may not be transferred abroad without the permission of the Suomen Pankki. Any other transactions in securities, and the export of securities that involve nonresident interests, require approval. If the securities were acquired with convertible foreign ex- change or with markkaa from a Convertible Account, approval for their export can be obtained freely. Inward direct investments that involve participation of more than 20 percent in the share capital of a Finnish enterprise require the approval of the Council of State. Such approval is usually granted, with the exception of investments in the forest and mining industries and in certain traditionally regulated activities. The transfer of direct investment capital requires authorization by the Suomen Pankki. Such authorization is usually granted, if the underlying investment has been approved by the Council of State. Repatriation of direct investment is subject to the approval of the Suomen Pankki, which is freely given. Outward transfers of capital, including transfers of direct investment by residents, require individual approval by the Suomen Pankki. 8On January 1, 1986 authorization was granted for residents of Finland to invest in foreign listed securities, to place funds in accounts with foreign monetary institutions, or to leave foreign claims unrepa- triated up to a total of the equivalent of Fmk 10,000 a calendar year. FINLAND Proceeds from the sale of securities and real property must be repatriated under the general rule of repatriation. Subject to certain regulations, authorized banks and insurance companies have permission to purchase foreign and Finnish securities issued abroad. Purchases of real estate abroad are authorized up to a limit of Fmk 300,0009 a person, subject to the approval of the Suomen Pankki, which is granted liberally. The upper limit on shares entitling part-time use of a real estate abroad is Fmk 300,000.10 Finnish emigrants11 are generally permitted an ex- change allowance of up to Fmk 300,000 a person or, in the case of emigrating families, Fmk 150,000 a person in addition to the basic tourist travel allowance. There is an automatic exchange allowance of up to Fmk 10,00012 a calendar year for each donor for gifts and contributions to nonresidents. External borrowing by Finnish residents, particularly in the form of short-term or long-term financial credits, including bond issues abroad, requires the specific approval of the Suomen Pankki, which exercises surveil- lance over the amount of capital inflow as well as the terms and timing. Lending to nonresidents by nonbanks is generally restricted to export credits. No permission is needed for customary export credits.13 Medium-term and long-term borrowing abroad, other than borrowing by the State or in the form of import credits, is in certain exceptional cases subject to deposit requirements by the Suomen Pankki. International banking activities of Fin- nish commercial banks are mostly free of regulations, other than certain supervisory reporting requirements. Gold Residents may freely hold, buy, and sell gold in any form in Finland. Imports of unwrought gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Export and Import Permits Office; such licenses are not nor- mally granted except for imports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. The global quota list contains a quota for industrial gold, for which licenses are granted freely. Changes During 1985 Prescription of Currency February 1. Following the termination, on Jan- uary 31, 1985, of the payments agreement between Finland and Hungary, payments between the two coun- tries were placed on a convertible currency basis. 9On January 1, 1986 the individual limit on purchases of real estate abroad was raised to Fmk 600,000. 10On January 1, 1986 the upper limit on shares entitling part-time use of real estate abroad was raised to Fmk 600,000. 11 On January 1, 1986 the foreign exchange allowance for emigrants was raised to Fmk 600,000 a person or, in the case of an emigrating fam i ly, Fmk 400,000 a person. 12On January 1, 1986 the annual limit on freely remittable amounts for gifts and contributions to nonresidents was raised to Fmk 50,000. 13On January 1, 1986 supplier's credits to residents of Bulgaria, the German Democratic Republic, and the U .S .S .R. were made subject to special permit by the Suomen Pankki. 227 ©International Monetary Fund.

Not for Redistribution FRANCE (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of France is the Franc. France partici- pates with Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Nether- lands in the exchange rate and intervention mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS). In accordance with this agreement, France maintains the spot exchange rates between the franc and the currencies of the other participants within margins of 2.25 percent (in the case of the Italian lira, 6 percent) above or below the cross rates based on the central rates expressed in European Currency Units (ECUs). The agreement implies that the Bank of France (the central bank) stands ready to buy or sell the currencies of the other participating states in unlimited amounts at specified intervention rates. On December 31, 1985 these rates were as follows: Specified Intervention Rates Per: 100 Belgian or Luxembourg francs 100 Danish kroner 100 deutsche mark 100 Netherlands guilders 100 Irish pounds 100 Italian lire Francs Upper limit Lower limit 15.6590 86.3650 313.6300 278.3500 968.8500 0.4785 14.9700 82.5650 299.8500 266.1000 926.2500 0.4259 The participants in the EMS are not maintaining the exchange rates for other currencies within fixed limits. However, in order to ensure a proper functioning of the system, they intervene in concert to smooth out fluctua- tions in exchange rates, the intervention currencies being each other's and the U .S. dollar. Buying and selling rates for 20 foreign currencies are quoted daily on the basis of market rates.l On December 30, 1985 the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were F 7.55300 and F 7.56900, respectively, per US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Fixed conversion rates in terms of the franc apply to the currencies of the overseas territories and to the currencies of the countries that are linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account2 as follows: (1) In the overseas territories of French Polynesia, New Caledonia, and Wallis and Futuna Islands, the currency Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Djibouti francs, Finnish markkaa, Greek drachmas, Irish pounds, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, U.S. dollars, and za'ires. 2Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Congo, Cote d'lvoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo. used is the CFP franc, which has a fixed parity with the franc of CFPF 1 = F 0.055. (2) Fixed conversion rates in terms of the franc apply to the currencies of the Operations Account countries (see footnote 2). These rates are CFAF 1 = F 0.02 for the CFA franc, which circulates in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Cote d'lvoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo. Authorized banks in France and in Monaco, which may also act on behalf of banks established abroad or in Operations Account countries, are permitted to deal spot or forward in the exchange market in France. Authorized banks may also deal spot and forward with their correspondents in foreign markets in all currencies. Nonbank residents may purchase foreign exchange for- ward in respect of specified transactions. Forward exchange cover is prohibited for term transactions on commodity markets; and forward cover in respect of spot transactions in commodities is limited to two days, with the obligation to redeem foreign exchange receipts after the eight-day period. France formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2 , 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from February 15, 1961. Exchange Control Territory The exchange control regulations are applicable in all territories of the French Republic, that is, in continental France, Corsica, the Overseas Departments (Guade- loupe, Martinique, French Guiana, Reunion, and St. Pierre and Miquelon), Mayotte, and the three Overseas Territories (Wallis and Futuna Islands, New Caledonia, and French Polynesia). No exchange control is applied in relation to Monaco or the Operations Account countries (see footnote 2); payments between France and these countries are free of restriction on the part of France and take place at fixed exchange rates. All other countries are considered foreign countries for exchange control purposes; all payments between France and foreign countries are subject to exchange control. For imports and exports of gold, the Operations Account countries are also considered foreign countries. The exchange control regulations include controls over inward and outward direct investment and other borrowing abroad on the basis of Decree No. 68-1021 of November 24, 1968. This decree is applicable to financial relations with all countries except those belong- ing to the French Franc Zone (i.e., Operations Account countries). Certain exchange operations are free from any prior authorization; these include direct investment coming from and going to EC countries, which are nevertheless submitted to prior notification. 229 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FRANCE Administration of Control The Directorate of the Treasury of the Ministry of Economy, Finance, and the Budget is the coordinating agency for financial relations with foreign countries. It is responsible for exchange control and all matters relating to inward and outward direct investment and to borrow- ing abroad, unless they relate to real estate companies, in which case the Bank of France screens applications. The Directorate of the Treasury also evaluates the balance of payments, together with the Bank of France, which collects the data for its compilation. Certain exchange control powers have been delegated to the Bank of France, including the authority to license imports and exports of gold. Other exchange control powers have been delegated to the Directorate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes and, in the Overseas Departments and Territories, to the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE). The Directorate of Insurance of the Ministry of Economy, Finance, and the Budget has certain powers in respect of matters relating to insurance, reinsurance, annuities, etc. The execution of all transfers has been delegated to authorized banks and stockbrokers and to the Postal Administration. The Directorate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes establishes import and export procedures and controls, within the framework of commercial policy directives given by the Directorate of Foreign Economic Relations (DREE); the Directorate- General also issues import and export licenses and is responsible for any litigation relating to the exchange regulations. Technical visas required for certain imports and exports are issued by the appropriate ministry or by the Directorate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes. The Ministry of Industry has certain responsibilities in respect of licensing contracts and contracts relating to technical assistance. Prescription of Currency Settlements with the Operations Account countries may be made in francs or the currency issued by any institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury.3 Settlements with all other countries may be made in any of the currencies of those countries or through nonresident Foreign Accounts in Francs. Importers and exporters are free to invoice in any currency. Nonresident Accounts A nonresident account in francs may be freely opened by an authorized bank for nonresidents, including French nationals (other than officials) who have been residing abroad for at least two years. All overdrafts and advances on nonresident-held franc accounts are subject to general or specific permission. Foreign Accounts in Francs may be freely credited with (1) the franc proceeds of the spot or forward sale of foreign currencies on the exchange market by a nonresi- dent; (2) the franc proceeds of the sale of foreign bank notes to an authorized bank by a nonresident bank or a traveler; (3) the franc equivalent of an authorized bank's arbitrage in foreign currencies on a foreign market; (4) French bank notes (and those of the Operations Account countries) mailed direct from abroad to the main office of the Bank of France by an authorized bank's foreign correspondents; (5) transfers from other Foreign Accounts in Francs; (6) any authorized payment by a resident to a nonresident, including interest on balances in Foreign Accounts in Francs; (7) the pro- ceeds, income, and amortization from French and foreign securities held in a foreign dossier in France, and the proceeds of the sale on a French stock exchange of securities denominated in French francs, including secu- rities held by authorized banks; (8) liquidation proceeds of nonresident-held direct investments;4 and (9) the proceeds of the sale, through the intermediation of a notary public, of nonresident-owned real estate to phys- ical or juridical persons of foreign nationality; should the nonresident be a French national, he or she must show proof that the property was originally purchased by debiting a foreign account or by inward transfer of foreign exchange. These accounts may be freely debited for: (1) spot purchases of any foreign currency on the exchange market by a nonresident; (2) the purchase by a nonresi- dent of foreign bank notes or withdrawals in French bank notes; (3) the equivalent in francs of arbitrage abroad in foreign currencies by an authorized bank; (4) French bank notes (and those of Operations Account countries) mailed by authorized banks direct to their foreign correspondents; (5) transfers to other Foreign Accounts in Francs; (6) approved direct investment in France by nonresidents (see footnote 4); (7) purchases of real estate from residents, through the intermediation of a notary public; (8) purchases in France of listed French or foreign securities; (9) interest on and repayment of loans granted in accordance with the relevant regulations by residents; (10) any payment by a nonresident to a resident; and (11) repayment of consumer and real estate loans by French banks for foreigners living in France. If francs accruing to a nonresident are not transferable, or are not immediately transferable, they may be credited to a Suspense Account in Francs in the name of the beneficiary. The unremittable funds of emigrants of French nationality must be retained in resident accounts (comptes interieurs)', emigrants of foreign nationality become nonresidents immediately and, therefore, may take out all of their assets upon departure. Diplomatic personnel working in France may hold resident and nonresident accounts. In addition, nonresidents may 3 Comprising the institutes of issue of the Operations Account countries and the Overseas Institute of Issue (for New Caledonia, French Polynesia, Mayotte, and Wallis and Futuna Islands). 4Subject to compliance with the provisions of Decree No. 68-1021 of November 24, 1968, as amended by Decree No. 71-144 of February 22, 1971 and Decree No. 8O-618 of August 4, 1980. 230 ©International Monetary Fund.

Imports and Import Payments Goods originating in and shipped from other countries that are accorded privileged treatment in respect of trade transactions (see section on Exchange Control Territory, above) are generally admitted free of quantitative restric- tions and individual licenses. Imports of goods that originate in other countries and are not covered by French import liberalization require individual licenses. Some imports from non-EC countries are subject to minimum prices; these require an administrative visa and sometimes, exceptionally, an import license. Certain imports require certificates of origin. For import control purposes, countries other than those that are accorded privileged treatment are divided into four groups according to the extent of import liberalization: (1) the former OEEC countries, their dependent territories and certain former dependent ter- ritories, Andorra, Canada, Egypt, Ethiopia, Fiji, Fin- land, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Liberia, Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, United States, Western Samoa, and Yugoslavia; (2) some specified countries;5 (3) the East- ern European countries (Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslo- vakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and U .S .S .R . ), People's Republic of China, Democratic People's Re- public of Korea, and Mongolia; and (4) German Demo- cratic Republic. Goods covered by the import liberaliza- tion arrangements applicable to one country may be imported freely from another country, provided that the country of origin and the country of shipment both benefit from the same degree of liberalization. Imports of practically all industrial products from countries in group (1) are free of quantitative restric- tions, but restrictions are applied to a number of agricultural and electronic products; there is relatively little difference between the lists of goods that may be imported freely from different countries in this group. Imports of certain industrial products from countries in group (2) are restricted, and restrictions are applied to these and to certain additional industrial products from group (3) countries. For some commodities, global quotas are allocated annually (petroleum and petroleum products) or semiannually and apply to all countries (other than those that have bilaterally negotiated quotas or receive privileged treatment). Imports from all coun- tries of certain agricultural items and certain raw mate- rials are free of quantitative restrictions. Imports from non-EC countries of most products covered by the Common Agricultural Policy of the EC are subject to variable import levies that have replaced 5Afghanistan, Argentina, Australia, Bhu tan, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Japan, Republic of Korea, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Mexico, Nepal, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Uruguay, Venezuela, Yemen Arab Republic, and People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. FRANCE all previous barriers to imports; common EC regulations are also applied to imports from non-EC countries of most other agricultural and livestock products. Liberalized imports are hot subject to trade controls, but do require a customs document that constitutes the customs declaration. However, as an exchange control measure, the domiciliation (registration) of the import transaction at an authorized bank may be prescribed. For some liberalized imports, an administrative visa issued by the Central Customs Administration or by the appropriate ministry is required on an import declara- tion. Imports of the products of the European Coal and Steel Community require such administrative visas when originating in non-ECSC countries. Other imports generally require individual import licenses. These are granted up to quotas determined on an individual commodity basis or for a group of commodities and are applicable to specified countries or areas in accordance with trade agreements or an import plan drawn up for a definite period. Imports of some products must pass through designated customs offices. Documents accompanying goods passing through cus- toms must be written or translated into French. Payments for imports from foreign countries must be made by credit to a Foreign Account in Francs or with foreign currency purchased in the French exchange market. Import transactions relating to foreign countries and valued at F 250,000 or more must be domiciled with an authorized bank, to which the necessary import documents must be presented and through which all payments related to the import must be made. The amounts that may be transferred through postal channels are not subject to limitation, but in practice, the Postal Administration does not make import payments valued at over F 250,000, as it does not undertake domiciliation. Authorized banks may without special authorization permit advance payments to be made that are provided for in the commercial contract, up to 30 percent of the price for capital goods and up to 10 percent for all other goods. Higher advance payments require prior approval by the Customs Administration. For all imports, import- ers may purchase spot foreign currency two working days before utilization; utilization cannot take place before the payment falls due. There is no restriction on the use of suppliers' credit. Forward cover in foreign currency other than the ECU for import payments is limited to specified commodities, namely, green coffee, rice, hides and skins, hairs, wool, cotton, and cotton waste. Forward cover must not exceed three months and must be carried out in the currency stipulated in the contract and be terminated not later than the day of the settlement; should settlement be effected before the expiration of three months, the operation must be canceled for the remaining period. If the settlement of the contract is deferred, the forward covering can be extended for a maximum of eight days without prior authorization. In cases where the contract is canceled, the covering operation must be terminated immediately. If the cancellation results in a foreign exchange profit, 231 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FRANCE the bank involved must inform the Bank of France. Importers are allowed to make forward purchases of foreign currencies for a period of up to six months for the purposes of import payments invoiced in ECUs and related charges. Payments for Invisibles Payments for current invisibles to foreign countries are controlled but are not restricted as to amount. If justifying documents are presented and certain exchange control requirements are met, authorized banks are permitted to approve applications for payments for many categories of current invisibles without any limitation; for certain other categories of current invisibles, estab- lished limits have been set. Applications for all other payments for invisibles and for amounts in excess of established limits are referred to the Bank of France to prevent unauthorized capital transfers; such applications are approved if a genuine current payment is involved. Any resident may make remittances abroad up to the equivalent of F 3,000 a person each month, provided that the transfers do not serve as a means of accumulating funds abroad. Outward remittances for family support abroad are limited to the equivalent of F 6,000 a person a month; transfers in excess of this amount require the approval of the Bank of France or the CCCE. Transfers of donations to nonresidents are subject to authorization by the Bank of France. Payments that may be authorized without limitation by authorized banks include those related to approved trade transactions; income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties; banking commis- sions, patent fees, and specified categories of taxes; specified insurance payments; fees to medical doctors, lawyers, etc.; alimony in accordance with court deci- sions; and net salaries or wages of foreigners employed in France, provided that the transfer takes place within three months from the date of payment. Irrespective of the exchange control regulations, cer- tain transactions between persons or firms in France and abroad are subject to restriction; these include certain transactions relating to insurance, reinsurance, and road and river transport. The basic exchange allocation for tourist travel to foreign countries by residents (defined for this purpose as including residents of Operations Account countries) is the equivalent of F 5,000 a person a trip, which may be taken up for any number of trips a year. The basic allocation for business travel is the same plus the equivalent of F 1,000 a person a day in French francs or foreign currency. Applications for exchange in excess of the basic allowance for business travel may be approved by the Bank of France or the CCCE, provided that no capital outflow is involved. Any unutilized foreign currency in excess of the equivalent of F 1,000 must be surrendered within one month upon return to France. Applications for travel exchange cannot be submitted earlier than one month before departure. 232 Resident travelers may freely take out the equivalent of F 5,000 in means of payments acquired in the exchange market against a tourist travel allocation. Nonresident travelers may not, in principle, take out more than the equivalent of F 5,000 in foreign bank notes, unless these were declared upon entry and the amount to be taken out does not exceed that imported minus any amounts exchanged for francs plus any reconversion of francs into foreign currencies. However, nonresident travelers may freely take out any other means of payment established in their name abroad; in addition, subject to the submission of an authorized bank's declaration, they may take out any amount in foreign bank notes or foreign currency traveler's checks acquired in France from an authorized bank by conver- sion of foreign exchange in the French exchange market, by debit to a Foreign Account in Francs, or by debit to a foreign currency account. Resident travelers to foreign countries may take out F 5,000 in French bank notes. These bank notes may be used abroad, and any amount taken out is charged against the basic exchange allocation of F 5,000. Nonresident travelers may take out F 5,000 in French bank notes and may reconvert into foreign currency in the French exchange market any French bank notes up to F 5,000 obtained by the conversion in that market of foreign means of payment that they declared upon entry or obtained by debit to a Foreign Account in Francs; any remaining French bank notes must be deposited with the customs against issuance of a receipt. Exports and Export Proceeds Certain goods on a prohibited export list may be exported only under a special license. Some other exports also require individual licenses, but if the total value does not exceed F 1,000 (F 5,000 for art objects or collectors' items), these exports may be permitted without any formality, subject to certain exceptions. Exports to foreign countries are subject to exchange control. Payment must be received through the exchange market. The repatriation6 and, where appropriate, the surrender by sale in the exchange market of proceeds from exports to foreign countries are required not later than 15 days from export deliveries. Small business exporters may be authorized by the Bank of France to spend locally up to 5 percent of export receipts or F 30,000 a month (whichever is higher) held in foreign currency accounts. Authorized banks may freely extend foreign currency advances to exporters; such advances and their repayment may be settled in the exchange market, as may the proceeds from the discounting of foreign currency drafts presented by exporters. For values not exceeding the equivalent of F 50,000, export proceeds may be received in French or foreign bank notes or bank notes issued by an institute of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Repatriation may take place either by collection of foreign currency or by debit to a Foreign Account in Francs. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Treasury, or by debit to a postal checking account in France; export proceeds from F 50,000 to F 150,000 may be received in checks drawn on a bank account maintained abroad or on a foreign bank account opened in France, and those above F 150,000 must be received by transfer; in addition, for such amounts, exporters are required within one month from the date of shipment to sell on a spot or forward basis 90 percent of the foreign currency proceeds from exports. All export transactions related to foreign countries and valued at F 250,000 or more must be domiciled with an authorized bank; the Director-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes, how- ever, may exempt certain approved firms from domicili- ation requirements. Certain goods purchased in France by persons not normally residing in France are considered as exports, even when paid for in francs, and are exempt from taxes. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with Monaco and the Operations Account countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets (with the exception of income from work in border areas) must be repatriated and, where appropriate, surrendered within one month from the due date and, in any case, within eight working days of receipt. With minor exceptions for certain types of transactions, services performed for nonresidents do not require licenses. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin (except gold coin) in francs, CFA francs, CFP francs, or any foreign currency; however, the exchange of bank notes issued by Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia is prohibited at the request of those countries. Resident travelers must sell in the exchange market any foreign bank notes or traveler's checks in excess of F 1,000 within a month of entry. Capital Capital movements between France and Monaco and the Operations Account countries are free of exchange control; capital transfers between France and all other countries are subject to exchange control approval. With the exception of purchases of French and foreign securities abroad, outward transfers of resident-owned capital generally are restricted; capital receipts from foreign countries are permitted freely, provided that the foreign exchange proceeds are surrendered by sale in the exchange market (but see below for special controls over borrowing abroad and over inward direct investment). Capital assets abroad of residents are not subject to repatriation. Outward remittances of funds for the purpose of buying a second place of residence is subject to prior authorization by the Bank of France. The transfer abroad of nonresident-owned fund s, including the sales proceeds of capital assets, is not restricted. French and foreign securities held in France by nonresidents may be exported, provided that they have FRANCE been deposited with an authorized bank in a foreign dossier (dossier etranger de valeurs mobilieres); French securities held under a foreign dossier can also be sold in France and the sales proceeds can be transferred abroad. Foreign securities held in France by a nonresident must be deposited with an authorized bank; French securities held in France by nonresidents need not be deposited but cannot be dealt with or exported unless they have been deposited. Foreign securities held in France by residents must be deposited with a qualified bank or broker. Residents may hold French and foreign securities abroad under the control of a French authorized bank or broker. The export for the account of residents of French securities held in France is prohibited, except when they are to be sold abroad. Subject to compliance with the special regulations concerning inward and outward direct investment that are summarized below and the provision of the devise litre system,7 residents may purchase French and foreign securities on stock exchanges abroad, through authorized banks, except for equities with a maturity of less than five years issued by foreign governments.8 French and foreign securities may be held or sold abroad, but they may also be imported and then either held or sold on a French stock exchange. The proceeds of the sale abroad of securities denominated in foreign currency may be reinvested in such securities not later than one month from the selling date, or be sold to another resident on the devise litre market within the same period; beyond the time l im i ts, the proceeds in foreign currency must be sold in the exchange market. Correspondingly, nonresi- dents holding French or foreign securities abroad (whether acquired before November 24, 1968 or later) may import them into France through an authorized bank and hold them in a foreign dossier. Only French securities and securities denominated in ECUs issued in France by European Community institutions may, how- ever, be sold in France, with the proceeds being repatriable by nonresidents. The exchange control regulations include controls over inward and outward direct investment and other borrowing abroad on the basis of Decree No. 68-1021, of November 24, 1968. This decree is applicable to financial relations with all countries except those belong- ing to the French Franc Zone ( i .e ., Operations Account countries). Certain exchange operations are free from any prior authorization; these include direct investment coming from and going to EC countries, which are nevertheless submitted to prior notification. Foreign direct investments in France and French direct investments abroad, including loans constituting a direct 7Under the devise litre system, purchases of foreign securities by residents are required to be matched by the proceeds from sales of such securities by residents. The devise litre is the un it of account in which these matching operations are denominated, and its value can fluctuate on the basis of domestic demand and supply of foreign securities. Transactions under the devise litre system can be made in any foreign security. 8The existing general permissions do not cover the sale in France by nonresidents, or the purchase abroad by residents, of securities that are not quoted on a recognized stock exchange. 233 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FRANCE investment, require prior declaration to the Minister of Economy, Finance, and the Budget. Direct investments are defined as investments leading to control of a company or enterprise. Any participation exceeding 20 percent of the capital is considered as direct invest- ment. A participation that does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a firm whose shares are quoted on the stock exchange is not considered as direct investment. To determine whether a company is foreign controlled, the Treasury may also take into account any special relation- ships resulting from such factors as stock options, patents and licenses, and commercial contracts. Under specified provisos, foreign companies controlled by EC residents are free to establish a subsidiary and to take over any participation in the equity capital of a French company. Foreign companies controlled by other non- residents may establish a subsidiary or take over any participation under F 10 million in a French company, within one month following the declaration, unless the Minister of Economy, Finance, and the Budget formally notifies the companies of its decision to postpone the operation; such a decision is highly exceptional. What- ever the nationality of a nonresident investor, the Treasury is, however, entitled to issue a finding within one month to forbid such an establishment or par- ticipation, should it be deemed to jeopardize public health, order, security, or defense. Takeovers of French companies by non-EC residents amounting to more than F 10 million, as well as changes in shareholder's ownership percentage of any foreign-controlled corpora- tion, require an authorization. Exemptions from declara- tion or approval requirements are granted for increases of equity capital of a subsidiary by the parent company and for loans granted by a parent company to its subsidiary, provided that (a) the interest charges are at a normal market rate, (b) there is a defined schedule of repayment, and (c) each drawing remains ou ts tand ing for at least one year. The liquidation proceeds of foreign direct invest- ment in France may be freely transferred abroad; the liquidation itself must be reported to the Minister within 20 days of its occurrence. If the amount involved is more than F 1 million, documentary evidence must be sub- mitted in advance to the Directorate of the Treasury. Direct investment abroad by residents is exempt from prior declaration or prior authorization when the amount involved does not exceed F 15 million a year for each beneficiary firm abroad, and provided that the transac- tions do not involve holding companies, investment companies, investment trusts, unit trusts, mutual funds, or companies whose purpose is to facilitate the financing or treasury functions of enterprises belonging to one or more groups, as well as the financing of investments in agriculture and real estate. The liquidation of direct investment abroad is free from any prior application, provided that the corresponding funds are repatriated to France in due time. Foreign issues on the French capital market are subject to prior authorization by the Minister of Economy, Finance, and the Budget. The requirement is applicable 234 also to the Operations Account countries. Exempt from authorization, however, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the French Government, and (2) shares similar to securities that are already officially quoted on a stock exchange in France. Borrowing abroad by physical or juridical persons, whether public or private persons, whose normal resi- dence or registered office is in France, or by branches or subsidiaries in France of juridical persons whose regis- tered office is abroad, requires prior authorization by the Minister of Economy, Finance, and the Budget. The following types of borrowing are, in principle, exempt from this authorization: (1) borrowing by industrial firms for the execution of works abroad; (2) borrowing by any type of firm to finance imports or exports of goods; (3) loans related to certain international merchanting transactions; (4) borrowing related to the performance of services (other than income from labor or capital) when undertaken to finance operations executed abroad or transactions with foreign countries; (5) loans contracted by banks expressly permitted to borrow abroad (these include all authorized banks); and (6) foreign currency borrowing abroad by nonbank firms when the total amount outstanding of these loans does not exceed F 50 million for any one borrower, provided that the interest rate is a "normal" market rate, that the foreign exchange proceeds are surrendered, and that each draw- ing against the loan is separated by at least one year from the corresponding repayment. All borrowings in Euro- francs are subject to prior authorization. The application of the controls over direct investment and borrowing is delegated to the Bank of France insofar as they relate to French firms that are mainly engaged in real estate business. Lending abroad is subject only to exchange con- trol authorization by the Bank of France within the framework of directives issued by the Treasury. Since the imposition of exchange control in 1968, authorized banks have been virtually free to lend foreign currency to nonresidents, subject to certain reservations in respect of the granting of guarantees and varying limitations on their external position, and to resident importers and exporters. Lending to nonresidents in francs, however, is prohibited, with minor exceptions. Authorized banks' foreign currency assets and their overall liabilities in francs and foreign currency to nonresidents are free from limitation. Nonresidents may freely purchase French short-term securities, including treasury bills, bons de caisse, and private drafts. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire regularly, and dispose of gold in any form in France. They may continue to hold abroad any gold they held there prior to November 25, 1968. There is a free gold market for bars and coin in Paris, to which residents have free access and in which normally no official intervention takes place. Imports and exports of "monetary" gold (defined as gold having a fineness or a weight that is recognized in the ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution gold market) into or from the territory of continental France require prior authorization by the Bank of France. Imports or exports to or from the Bank of France itself, however, are exempted from that requirement. Imports and exports by private persons of gold objects (other than medals and bars, but including both personal and other jewelry) or numismatic gold coins, provided that their combined weight does not exceed 500 grams, are similarly exempt. Movements of industrial gold are subject to a simple declaration, as are imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold, such as gold-filled and gold-plated articles. Collectors' items of gold and gold antiques are subject to specific regulations. A 20-franc gold coin, the napoleon, is traded on the Paris stock exchange. In domestic trading, purchases of bars and coin are not subject to value-added tax. Imports of monetary gold are exempt from customs du ty and value-added tax. Domestic transactions in gold and gold coin are subject to capital gains tax. Changes During 1985 Import and Import Payments March 2.

Not for Redistribution GABON (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Gabon is the CFA Franc,1 which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. Exchange transac- tions in French francs between the BEAC and commer- cial banks at present take place at the rate of CFAF 50 = F 1. Buying and selling rates for certain foreign currencies are also officially posted, with quotations based-on the fixed rate for the French franc and the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market, and include a commission. Commissions are charged at the rate of 0.25 per mill on transfers made by the banks for their own accounts, and 0.225 per mill on all private capital transfers to countries that are not members of the BEAC, except those made for the account of the Treasury, national accounting offices, national and inter- national public agencies, and private entities granted exemption by the Ministry of Economy and Finance because of the nature of their activities, There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of those relating to gold, Gabon's exchange control measures do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Cote d'lvoire, Equatorial Guinea, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control The Directorate of Financial Institutions in the Minis- try of Economy and Finance supervises borrowing and lending abroad. Exchange control is administered by the Minister of Economy and Finance, who has partly delegated his approval authority for current payments to the authorized banks and that with respect to the external position of the banks to the BEAC. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be ef- fected through authorized intermediaries, that is, the Postal Administration and authorized banks. Import authorizations, and export authorizations, where neces- sary, are issued by the Directorate of External Trade of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Prescription of Currency Since Gabon is an Operations Account country, settle- ments with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the 'The CFA franc circulating in Gabon is issued by the Banque des Etats de 1'Afrique Centrale (BEAC) and is legal tender also in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, and the Congo. 236 Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury. Settlements with all other countries are usually made through correspondent banks in France in any of the currencies of those countries or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. BEAC bank notes may be credited to Foreign Accounts in Francs when they have been mailed to the BEAC agency in Libreville by an authorized bank's foreign correspondent. Otherwise, the crediting to nonresident accounts of BEAC bank notes, French bank notes, or bank notes issued by any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury is prohibited. Imports and Import Payments In general, imports from member countries of the Central African Customs and Economic Union (UDEAC) are free of formalities; imports of refined vegetable oil from these countries require prior approval. All imports from countries outside the UDEAC are subject to an authorization to import (when the value is more than CFAF 500,000). All imports, of any origin, are subject to authorization. For perishables and spare parts, an anticipatory authorization is given to simplify administrative procedures. Imports from countries out- side the UDEAC that are similar to, and compete with, domestic products are subject to licensing, but, with a few exceptions2 established by Ministerial Order, import authorizations are granted liberally in practice. Some imports are prohibited for security and health reasons. Imports of refined vegetable oil are suspended except when originating from member countries of the UDEAC. All imports of commercial goods must be insured through authorized insurance companies in Gabon. All import transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Authoriza- tions duly endorsed by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and the Ministry of Economy and Finance (Directorate of Financial Institutions) entitle importers to purchase the necessary foreign exchange, provided that the shipping documents are submitted to the authorized bank. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to 2Currently totaling about 30 items, including cement, ham, mineral water, plastic goods, sugar, batteries, and refined vegetable oil. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution approval, which is granted when the appropriate docu- ments are submitted. For many types of payment the approval authority has been delegated to authorized banks. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Trans- fers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted freely when the basic transaction has been approved. For tourist travel, residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may obtain an exchange allocation equivalent to CFAF 200,000 a person a trip (CFAF 100,000 for children under 10 years) for any number of trips a year; any foreign exchange remaining after return to Gabon must be surrendered. For business travel to foreign countries, there is a special allocation equivalent to CFAF 25,000 a day, subject to a maxi- mum of CFAF 500,000 a trip. Tourist and business travel allocations may not be combined. Travelers to foreign countries may take out up to a maximum of CFAF 25,000 in BEAC bank notes; the amount taken out is not deducted from the travel allocation. Travelers to France, Monaco, and the other Operations Account countries may not export CFA or French bank notes in excess of an amount equivalent to CFAF 200,000 (CFAF 100,000 for children under 10 years) for tourist travel; for business travel the amount of such bank notes that may be carried out is the equivalent of CFAF 25,000 a day and CFAF 500,000 a trip. Transfers may be effected without limit through the banking or postal systems. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports require authorization, irrespective of destina- tion. Export transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Export proceeds received in currencies other than those of France (as defined above), Monaco or an Operations Account country must be surrendered. Export proceeds normally must be received within 150 days after the arrival of the commodities at their destination. The proceeds must be collected and, if received in a foreign currency, surrendered within one month of the due date. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be collected and, if received in foreign currency, be surrendered within a month of the due date. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BEAC, the Bank of France, or any other bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) of countries outside the French Franc Area. GABON Capital Capital movements between Gabon and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require the approval of the Directorate of Financial Institutions and are restricted, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. All foreign securities, foreign currency, and titles embodying claims on foreign countries or nonresidents that are held in Gabon by residents or nonresidents must be deposited with authorized banks in Gabon. Special controls (additional to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable) are maintained over borrowing and lending abroad, over inward and outward direct investment, and over the issuing, adver- tising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Gabon; these controls relate to the transactions themselves, not to payments or receipts. With the exception of controls over the sale or introduction of foreign securities in Gabon, the control measures do not apply to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries. Direct investments abroad3 must be declared to the Ministry of Economy and Finance unless they take the form of a capital increase resulting from reinvestment of undistributed profits; the fu ll or partial liquidation of such investments also must be declared to the Ministry unless the operation involves the relinquishing of a participation that had previously been approved as constituting a direct investment abroad. Foreign direct investments in Gabon4 must be declared to the Ministry unless they take the form of a capital increase resulting from reinvestment of undistributed profits; within two months from receipt of the declaration, the Ministry may request the postponement of the project. The full or partial liquidation of direct investments in Gabon must also be declared to the Ministry unless the operation involves the relinquishing of a participation that had previously been approved as constituting a direct invest- ment in Gabon. Both the making and the liquidation of direct investments, whether these are Gabonese invest- ments abroad or foreign investments in Gabon, must be reported to the Ministry within 20 days following each operation. Direct investments are defined as investments implying control of a company or enterprise. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Gabon requires prior authorization by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Exempt from authorization, however, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Gabonese Government, and (2) shares similar to securities whose issue, advertising, or offering for sale in Gabon has previously been authorized. 3 Inc lud ing those made through foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in Gabon and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Gabon.

The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans constituting a direct investment abroad for which prior approval has been obtained, as indicated above; (2) loans directly connected with the rendering of services abroad by the persons or firms mentioned above, or with the financing of commercial transactions either between Gabon and countries abroad or between foreign countries in which these persons or firms take part; (3) loans contracted by registered banks; and (4) loans other than those mentioned above, when the total amount outstand- ing does not exceed CFAF 50 million for any one borrower. The contracting of loans referred to under (4) that are free of authorization, and each repay- ment thereon, must be declared to the Directorate of Financial Institutions within 20 days of the operation, unless the total outstanding amount of all loans con- tracted abroad by the borrower is CFAF 5 million or less. Lending abroad by physical or juridical persons, whether public or private persons, whose normal resi- dence or registered office is in Gabon, or by branches or subsidiaries in Gabon of juridical persons whose regis- tered office is abroad, requires prior authorization by the Ministry of Economy and Finance.

The making of loans that are free of authorization, and each repayment thereon, must be declared to the Directorate of Financial Institutions within 20 days of the operation, except when the total outstanding amount of all loans granted abroad by the lender does not exceed CFAF 5 m i l l ion. Under the Investment Code of December 4, 1961, as amended on March 23, 1967 and Ju ly 9, 1971, any enterprise to be established in Gabon, whether domestic or foreign, is granted, under certain conditions, reduced duties and taxes on specified imports, as well as exemption from direct taxes on specified income. A m in imum of 10 percent state participation is required for any enterprise located in Gabon. The Code provides for four categories of preferential treatment. In addition to fiscal privileges, eligible companies may receive protec- tion against foreign competition and may be given priority in the allocation of imports, public credit, and government contracts. A Presidential Decree of April 11, 1975 provides that foreign companies investing in Gabon must offer shares for purchase by Gabonese nationals. Non-Gabonese firms or individuals are not permitted to own land in Gabon. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Gabon. Imports and exports of gold require the authorization of the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, and (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold- filled or gold-plated articles). The export of gold is the monopoly of the Societ£ Gabonaise de Recherches et d'Exploitation Minieres (SOGAREM). Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Changes During 1985 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 238 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution THE GAMBIA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement1 The currency of The Gambia is the Gambian Dalasi, which is pegged to the pound sterling, the intervention currency, at D 5 = £ stg. 1. The Central Bank of The Gambia deals in pounds sterling at the fixed rate of D 5 = £ stg. 1, subject to a commission of 0.0625 per- cent buying and 0.5 percent selling. The commercial banks deal with customers for spot transactions in sterling at rates within 1 percent of the Central Bank's fixed rate and in other currencies at rates determined by the prevailing market rate in London for the currency concerned against the pound sterling. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. There is a multiple currency practice associated with a requirement that the domestic currency counterpart of all external payments arrears be placed in a Blocked Account at the Central Bank of The Gambia. Administration of Control Exchange control policy is determined by the Ministry of Finance and Trade. The day-to-day administration of exchange control is carried out by the Central Bank. The commercial banks,2 which have been appointed as authorized dealers, may authorize sales of foreign currencies for imports covered by specific licenses and, up to specified amounts, for travel expenses and sundry payments abroad. All other sales of foreign currencies are subject to authorization by the Central Bank. The Ministry of Finance and Trade is responsible for the issue of import and export licenses. Prescription of Currency Settlements with other countries may be made and received in dalasis or pounds sterling from nonresident sources or in any other currency. Settlements with the Central Bank of West African States (for Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'lvoire, Niger, Senegal, and Togo) and Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauri- tania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are normally made through the West African Clearing House.

In addition, there is legal provision for authorized dealers to maintain Blocked Accounts under the direction of the Central Bank. Imports and Import Payments* Importation of certain specified goods is prohibited from all sources, predominantly for social or health reasons or on grounds of public policy. The import from any country of rice, sugar, and wheat flour is subject to specific licensing in order to ensure the adequacy of such imports and their fair domestic pricing. Except for imports from Eastern European countries, the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Japan, which are subject to specific licens- ing, all other imports are freely permitted under an open general license. Settlement for imports from Eastern European coun- tries may be approved by an authorized dealer on production of evidence of importation for any commod- ity that is covered by a valid specific import license. For imports that do not require specific licensing, payment authorization is given by the Central Bank on production of evidence of importation or shipment. Advance pay- ments for imports, whether or not these are covered by specific licenses, are approved by the Central Bank in all cases where the payment is considered genuine and in accordance with normal commercial practice. Payments for imports may be made in dalasis or sterling to an External Account or in any other currency. All goods are subject to an import tax of 5 percent of the c .i .f. value unless otherwise specified. Imports made by the Government, diplomatic missions, and charitable organizations are exempt. There have been some delays in import payments. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles in foreign currencies require permission from the Central Bank (see footnote 2), with the exception that authorized dealers have been dele- gated powers to authorize travel expenses and sundry payments. Permission is given in all genuine cases. Irrespective of the purpose of the journey, authorized dealers may grant a basic exchange allowance of up to D 750 a person a trip but not exceeding D 1,500 in any one calendar year for travel abroad. For business, professional, or official purposes, authorized dealers may provide residents with exchange facilities of up to D 1,750 for any one journey at a rate not exceeding 3Under the system introduced on January 20, 1986, all imports are permissible under open general license, with the exception of specified commodities prohibited or restricted for social or health reasons or on grounds of public policy. 239 ©International Monetary Fund.

Visitors to The Gambia may also take out with them on departure any other currency notes declared by them when entering the country. There have been some delays in service payments on external debt. Exports and Export Proceeds4 Because of domestic requirements, the export of charcoal and firewood is subject to specific licensing. The export of all other goods can generally be made without individual licensing, if settlement is made in accordance with procedures laid down by the Central Bank. The Gambia Produce Marketing Board is the sole exporter of groundnut products, oil palm kernels, cotton, and all derivatives of cotton. Payment for exports must be received through an authorized dealer within six months from the date of export in dalasis, or in pound sterling from an External Account, or in any other currency. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in foreign currencies must be offered for sale to authorized dealers (see footnote 4). There is no restriction on the import of Gambian or other currency notes. 4Under the system introduced on January 20, 1986, all foreign exchange proceeds from international transactions other than loans and grants received directly by the Government and foreign exchange receipts of The Gambia Produce Marketing Board (which should be deposited or surrendered to the Central Bank) were to be sold to commercial banks operating in The Gambia at an exchange rate to be freely agreed upon between the seller and the respective banks. Capital Inward transfers of capital are not controlled, but outward transfers are subject to control (see footnote 2). At the time of making investments in The Gambia, nonresident investors may apply for a clearance from the Central Bank to facilitate subsequent repatriation of capital; the remittance of profits is allowed freely after provision has been made for local taxes and other legally incurred liabilities in The Gambia. All other applications to transfer capital abroad are dealt with by the Central Bank. Certain capital payments are in arrears.5 Loans and advances by the commercial banks to nonresidents are subject to the authorization of the Central Bank. Gold The import of gold coin minted in the United Kingdom requires licensing by the Ministry of Finance and Trade; otherwise, gold coin and bullion may be imported freely. All internal dealings in gold and the export of gold require the permission of the Central Bank. Neither the Central Bank nor the commercial banks deal in gold.

The Gambia Produce Marketing Board's monopoly over the importation of rice was discontinued, and the retail price of rice was decontrolled. 5 For the initial stage of the system introduced on January 20, 1986, settlement of the existing pipeline of commercial arrears was deferred pending completion of arrangements being worked out between the Central Bank and the commercial banks regarding liquidation of these arrears. 240 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Federal Republic of Germany is the Deutsche Mark. Germany1 participates with Bel- gium, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS), whereby each country maintains the value of its currency in relation to the currencies of the other participating countries. Under this agreement, spot exchange rates between the deutsche mark and the currencies of the other partici- pants are maintained within margins of 2.25 percent above or below the cross rates derived from the central rates expressed in European Currency Units (ECUs), except for the Italian lira for which the temporary intervention limit is plus or minus 6 percent. The agreement implies that the Deutsche Bundesbank (the central bank) stands ready to buy or sell the currencies of the other participating states in unlimited amounts at specified intervention rates. On Decem- ber 31, 1985 these rates were as follows: Deutsche Mark Upper limit Lower limit Specified Intervention Rates Per: 100 Belgian or Luxembourg francs 100 Danish kroner 100 French francs 1 Irish pound 1,000 Italian lire 100 Netherlands guilders 5.106 28.165 33.350 3.160 1.5630 90.770 4.882 26.925 31.885 3.021 1.3865 86.780 The participants in the EMS are not maintaining the exchange rates for other currencies within fixed limits. However, in order to ensure a proper functioning of the system, they intervene in concert with other participants to smooth out erratic fluctuations in exchange rates.

No such controls are currently in place. All banks in Germany are permitted to carry out foreign exchange transactions. A voluntary coordinating body within the banking system, the Central Capital Market Committee, formulates recommendations with regard to the timing of domestic bond issues, except issues by those institutions that have recourse to the capital market on a permanent basis. Imports and Import Payments The Import List comprises a total of 9,170 statistical positions. Their treatment is as follows: some 8,484 items may be imported free of license from any country. Commodities corresponding to some 8,772 positions may be imported free of license from countries in Country List A /B .3 Most items under import licensing are agricultural commodities under EC regulations. The import of some 600 textile items is governed by bilateral agreements of the EC with various supplier countries under the arrangement regarding international trade in textiles. Imports of coal from countries that are not members of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and from Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland are permitted within the framework of an annual global quota. The Common Agricultural Policy of the EC covers about 1,700 statistical items; most of these are subject to variable import levies, which in most cases have replaced previous barriers to imports. Payments for imports are unrestricted. Commodity futures may be dealt in freely. Most transit trade transactions may also be carried out freely. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles may be made freely without individual license. German and foreign notes and coin and other means of payment may be exported freely. The following transactions —but not the related pay- ments —between residents and nonresidents are subject to restriction: the chartering of foreign ships from 3 Countries in List A/B are those of the former OEEC area and Finland and all other countries except those in List C.

Exports and Export Proceeds With few exceptions, export transactions may be carried out freely. For statistical purposes, an export notification is required for all goods. Certain exports (mostly strategic goods) are subject to individual licens- ing. The customs authorities exercise control over export declarations. Foreign exchange proceeds from exports do not have to be declared or surrendered, and they may be used for all payments. Proceeds from Invisibles With few exceptions, services performed for nonresi- dents do not require licenses. However, licenses are required for transactions related to specific sea services and for technical assistance through the delivery of constructional drawings, materials, and instructions for manufacture to residents of List C countries (see footnote 3), if such assistance is for the production of goods whose export requires a license. There are no restrictions on the receipt of payments for services rendered to nonresidents; however, receipts exceeding DM 2,000 on account of services have to be reported for statistical purposes. German and foreign notes and coin and other means of payment may be imported freely. Capital Residents and nonresidents may, in principle, export capital freely without a license. Foreign and international bond issues on the German capital market do not require official approval. The issue of bonds denominated in deutsche mark by subsidiaries of German banks in Luxembourg is banned, on the basis of a "gentlemen's agreement" between the banks and the Bundesbank. All resident banks, including legally independent foreign- owned banks, may lead-manage issues of foreign bonds denominated in deutsche mark; the right of foreign- owned banks to lead-manage foreign deutsche mark bond issues is contingent, however, on reciprocal lead- management rights of German-owned banks in the home countries of the foreign-owned banks operating in Germany. In principle, domestic and foreign securities of all types may be imported or exported freely. Following the changes in regulations beginning March 12, 1981, no restrictions are applied on the sale of German money market papers and fixed interest securi- ties by residents to nonresidents. Nonresidents' direct investments in Germany, purchases of real estate in Germany for investment or personal use, and purchases of German or foreign equities do not require approval. 242 There are no limitations on the disposal of legacies located in Germany and inherited by nonresidents or on legacies located abroad and inherited by residents. Residents are not required to repatriate or surrender their foreign exchange earnings or holdings. Banks are subject to m in imum reserve requirements on the level of their foreign liabilities with maturities of less than four years; the rates of deposit at the end of 1985 were, in principle, the same as those applicable to domestic liabilities, that is, 10.15 percent, 7.15 per- cent, and 4.5 percent on demand, time, and savings deposits, respectively. The principal exemption is for banks' foreign currency borrowings that are immediately reinvested abroad. Banks are free to pay interest on domestic or foreign currency balances held by nonresidents. Gold Residents may freely hold gold in any form at home or abroad and may negotiate gold in any form with residents or nonresidents, at home or abroad. There is a free gold market in Frankfurt. Imports and exports of gold in any form by residents and nonresidents are unrestricted and free of license; a customs declaration, however, is required. Imports of gold bullion and coin, unworked gold, and gold alloys are free of customs du ty but are subject to value-added tax at a rate of 14 percent. In the case of imports of gold coin where the assessment basis exceeds 250 percent of the fine gold value, the value-added tax is levied at a rate of 7 percent. Imports of monetary gold by the Bundesbank are exempt from value-added tax and from customs du ty. Domestic transactions in gold are subject to value-added tax at the same rate as imports, but under certain conditions no value-added tax is levied on transactions in gold bullion effected on gold ex- changes between brokers who are admitted to these exchanges. Commercial imports and exports of articles containing gold are subject to the general foreign trade regulations and in all cases are liberalized.

In June 1978 Ghana introduced a flexible exchange system under which the exchange rate for the cedi in terms of the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, was to be adjusted to reflect the underlying economic, financial, and balance of payments situation. Such adjustments were discontinued, however, in August 1978. On April 21, 1983 a multiple exchange rate system was introduced, based on bonuses and surcharges applied to specified transactions by the banks and other autho- rized dealers of foreign exchange at the rates of 750 per- cent and 990 percent of the official exchange rate of <£ 2.75 = US$1, and yielding exchange rates of <£ 23.375 = US$1 and <£ 29.975 = US$1. On October 10, 1983 the multiple exchange rate system was abolished, and the exchange rate system was unified at the rate of <t 30 = US$1. During 1985 the exchange rate of the cedi was adjusted three times, from (£ 50 to 0 60 = US$1, for a cumulative depreciation of 16.7 per- cent; on December 31, 1985 the exchange rate was (£ 60 = US$1.1 Rates are also quoted for certain other currencies,2 with daily quotations based on the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar in markets abroad. Rates for certain inconvertible currencies of the West African region, including the Nigerian naira, are also quoted daily, but are only applied to transactions under the West African Clearing House arrangement. The other quoted inconvertible currencies are the Gambian dalasi, the Guinean syli, the Sierra Leonean leone, the Guinea-Bissau peso, and the Mauritanian ouguiya. The authorized banks may exchange Ghanaian currency for any foreign currency. A processing fee of 5 percent is levied on purchases and repurchases of foreign exchange related to travel, and on exchange purchases for education, medical treatment abroad, and for private outward transfers. Administration of Control The Controller of Imports and Exports at the Ministry of Trade is empowered to prohibit, regulate, or license all imports and exports. Applications by the industrial sector and certain state agencies for individual import licenses must be channeled through the appropriate ministry or government agency for endorsement. The Controller of Imports and Exports issues import licenses on the basis of an annual import program formulated and implemented by the Import Programming and Monitor- _ __ January 13, 1986 the exchange rate was adjusted from <£, 60 = US$1 to <£ 90 = US$1, representing a depreciation of 33.3 percent. 2Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, CFA francs, Danish kroner, French francs, deutsche mark, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, New Zealand dollars, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. 244 ing Committee (IPMC), comprising the Secretaries of Finance and Economic Planning, Industries, Agricul- ture, Trade, and Health, and representatives of the Bank of Ghana, with the Coordinating Secretary as Chairman. All import licenses must be signed by the Director of Imports. The Exchange Control Department of the Bank of Ghana administers the allocation of exchange for payments for invisibles and capital. Permitted foreign exchange transactions must be made through authorized banks. Prescription of Currency Settlements between residents of Ghana and residents of other countries are made in permitted currencies. However, settlements related to transactions covered by bilateral payments agreements are made through clearing accounts maintained by the Bank of Ghana and the central or state banks of the countries concerned.3 Fur- thermore, proceeds from exports to countries with which Ghana does not have payments agreements must be received in the currency of the importing country (if that currency is among the currencies quoted by the Bank of Ghana) or in deutsche mark, pounds sterling, or U .S. dollars. Current payments to or from the Central Bank of West African States (for Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'lvoire, Niger, Senegal, and Togo) and The Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauri- tania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are normally made through the West African Clearing House. Convertible foreign currency accounts may be opened by resident and nonresident Ghanaians as well as non-Ghanaians at authorized foreign exchange dealer banks. Such ac- counts may be credited with foreign exchange earnings from all sources other than exports of goods and services originating from Ghana, agency commissions, and dis- counts on imports into Ghana. Outward transfers of funds from these accounts do not require the approval of the Bank of Ghana. Nonresident Accounts Nonresident account status is granted to embassies, legations, consulates, and offices of high commissioners in Ghana and to the career and established members of their staffs. This facility is also available to international institutions and foreign-registered companies operating in Ghana, as well as to nonresident Ghanaians. The opening of these accounts is subject to approval by the Bank of Ghana. The accounts may be credited with auth- orized outward payments, with transfers from other For- eign Accounts, and with the proceeds from sales of any convertible currency, other than restricted currencies. 3Ghana maintains operative bilateral payments arrangements with Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, the German Democratic Republic, Romania, and Yugoslavia. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution They may be debited for inward payments, for transfers to other Foreign Accounts, and for purchases of external currencies. Nonresident accounts maintained under the provisions of bilateral payments agreements are called "Official Accounts" or "Territorial Accounts." These accounts may be credited with authorized outward payments by residents, with transfers from Foreign Accounts, with payments received through the Bank of Ghana for settlements with bilateral payments agreement countries, and with proceeds from sales of external currencies, other than restricted currencies. They may be debited for authorized inward payments to residents of Ghana, for transfers to other Official Accounts related to the same country, and for transfers to the related clearing account at the Bank of Ghana. Funds not placed at the free disposal of nonresidents, for example, certain types of capital proceeds, may be deposited in Blocked Accounts. These accounts may be debited for authorized payments, including the purchase of approved securities. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Namibia (South West Africa) and South Africa are not permitted. Imports of some goods, including virtually all textiles and textile products, chocolate, and chilled or frozen fish, are prohibited. Imports of certain goods also produced in Ghana, certain luxury commodities, and certain goods deemed harmful to health or public order are severely restricted. Importa- tion of all goods, unless specifically prohibited, is allowed under special license where no transfer of foreign exchange through the Bank of Ghana or a com- mercial bank is required. Under similar arrangements, any importer is permitted to import from any country trade samples, personal or household effects, small gifts, single copies of publications, domestic pets, headloads of foodstuffs from neighboring countries, fish caught by Ghanaian-owned vessels, and reimports. All other items involving use of official foreign exchange require a specific import license. There is a list of commercial imports eligible for specific licenses that are issued for items that are considered essential within the framework of an annual import program. Certain imports are channeled through a bulk purchasing agent, the Ghana National Procurement Agency, or for public sector imports, the Ghana Supply Commission. For cases not requiring the provision of official foreign exchange, there is a special license by which all goods, unless prohibited, could be imported in commercial quantities. Except for aid imports, import licenses do not specify the country from which the commodity has to be imported, but they do specify whether payment is to be made in convertible or inconvertible currency. Licenses for payment in inconvertible currencies may be used for imports from any payments agreement country. Licenses are issued on a c. & f. basis and are endorsed to the effect that insurance must be covered in Ghana. GHANA Foreign exchange for payment of approved imports is, in principle, granted freely by the Bank of Ghana. However, arrears exist with respect to both current import payments and the repayments of matured 180-day trade credits established before February 7, 1972. With effect from January 2, 1980, the Bank of Ghana ceased to issue letters of credit or to perform other commercial banking operations related to import transactions. The Bank of Ghana, however, provides the necessary foreign exchange cover to the authorized banks. Most imports are effected with confirmed letters of credit established through Ghanaian banks, and usually on a sight basis. For imports valued at over US$2,000 f .o .b ., banks are forbidden to make payments against a letter of credit or a bank draft unless the import documents include a clean report of findings issued by the Societe Generate de Surveillance (SGS) which inspects the goods and verifies the price, quality, and quantity in the country of origin or shipment. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require specific approval of the Exchange Control Department of the Bank of Ghana, and documentary evidence must support all applications. Certain payments and transfers are in arrears. Most foreign exchange purchases for invisible payments are subject to a processing fee of 5 percent ad valorem, with the exception of invisible payments relating to imports. Transfers of normal bank charges payable to overseas bankers for import payments are generally authorized. The payment of buying commissions on imports is permitted within a limit of 3 percent of f .o .b. value. Freight charges may be paid to the local shipping agents; the transfer of funds to cover such charges is normally permitted, provided that the application is properly documented. With few exceptions, insurance on all imports shipped to Ghana on f.o.b. or c. & f. terms must be arranged in Ghanaian currency with local insurance companies. Remittances of income by non-Ghanaian employees and self-employed persons are normally limited to 40 percent of their net annual earnings, up to a maximum of US$2,600 a year plus leave pay; this personal remittance quota is intended to cover all personal and family requirements and commitments outside Ghana, including leave expenses, travel, education, insurance premiums, and subscriptions. Employees in the mining, timber, fishing, petroleum, and banking industries are, however, offered a choice between two alternative facili- ties. Under one of these, they are allowed to transfer 40 percent of their net annual earnings, up to a maximum of US$2,600 a year, plus leave pay and the balance on their savings at the end of their tour of du ty. Under the other facility, when documentary evidence of their commitments outside Ghana can be produced in support of their applications, employees can transfer up to 70 percent of their net annual earnings and the balance 245 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GHANA on their savings at the end of their tour of duty. With the exception of companies financed with locally raised capital, nonresident companies are, in principle, per- mitted to transfer abroad freely their net profits after tax; at present, however, transfers of profits are being authorized only on a limited basis. The transfer of profits by companies that have been financed with locally raised capital is not permitted. The basic exchange allocation for tourist travel, which had been reintroduced on August 21, 1978, was sus- pended again on August 7, 1979. Foreign exchange is not provided for tourist travel, and foreign exchange for business travel is granted only in exceptional cases, with per diem allowances determined on a case-by-case basis. Resident travelers may take with them foreign cur- rency notes equivalent to (£ 160, provided that not more than the equivalent of <£ 40 is taken in any one currency. Ghanaian bank notes up to (£ 40 may be taken out by any traveler. Nonresident travelers may take out any un- utilized foreign currency brought in and declared upon entry. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Namibia (South West Africa) and South Africa are prohibited. Exports of iron and steel scrap also are prohibited. Cocoa and certain other agricultural products are exported through a state-owned export agency, the Cocoa Board, and diamonds are exported through the Diamond Marketing Corporation. Normally, specific export licenses are required. Exports of bauxite, gold, manganese, and timber are subject to a 6 percent export tax; for cocoa, the export tax is the difference between export proceeds, on the one hand, and payments to farmers together with operational costs, on the other, if the former exceeds the latter. With the exceptions noted below, exporters are re- quired to collect and repatriate the full proceeds from their exports within 60 days of shipment; export pro- ceeds in foreign exchange must be surrendered to a commercial bank in Ghana upon receipt. Exporters are allowed to retain up to 20 percent of their export proceeds in accounts abroad for financing essential imports. (Such imports are, however, subject to the import license.) The foreign exchange retention scheme applies to all exports except residual oil and electricity; in the case of the cocoa sector, the retention limit is currently 10 percent. Proceeds from Invisibles All receipts from invisibles must be sold to authorized dealers. Foreign currency notes may be imported freely. Repurchases of foreign exchange acquired for the pur- pose of foreign travel are subject to a processing fee of 5 percent. The import of Ghanaian currency notes in excess of (£ 40 is prohibited. Capital Foreign investments in Ghana require prior approval by the Ghana Investment Centre if they are to benefit 246 from the facilities available under the Investments Code. Under the Investment Code of 1981, approved invest- ments are guaranteed, in principle, the right to transfer profits and, in the event of sale or liquidation, capital proceeds; tax holidays, initial capital allowances, etc., are also available for such investments. The Code stipulates that the assets of foreign investors may not be expropriated. Where there is a dispute over the amount of compensation, the dispute shall be settled in accor- dance with the established procedure for conciliation, for example, through arbitration by the International Center for Settlements of Investment Disputes or the United Nations Commission on International Trade and Law. Certain areas of economic activity are not open to foreigners. The proceeds of the sales of foreign own- ership to Ghanaian nationals are held in blocked, noninterest-bearing accounts with the Bank of Ghana; these accounts carry an exchange rate guarantee. Trans- fers of such funds are being effected gradually. Under a supplementary Investment Code issued in July 1985, incentives are provided aimed at promoting foreign investments that promise to be net foreign exchange earners. The main features of the Code, which offers incentives and guarantees to encourage foreign invest- ments in areas other than petroleum and mining (already covered by a Minerals Code), are as follows: (a) exemp- tion from customs duties in respect of importation of plant, machinery, and equipment; (b) more favorable depreciation or capital allowances; (c) permission to operate an external account in which at least 25 percent of the investing company's foreign exchange earnings may be retained for procuring machinery and equipment, spare parts, and raw materials, for servicing of debt, and for transfers of dividends and profits; (d) guarantee for the remittance of foreign capital in the event of sale or liquidation; and (e) protection against expropriation! The minimum requirement of investment capital to qualify under the Code is US$60,000 for joint ventures with a Ghanaian partner and US$100,000 for enterprises that are wholly foreign-owned. All outgoing capital movements must be approved by the Bank of Ghana; applications for such transfers must be supported by documentary evidence and are consid- ered on their merits. Transfers to beneficiaries under wills and intestacies are approved, provided that all local indebtedness has been settled. Requests for the transfer of funds representing personal assets of foreign residents in Ghana who emigrate are considered individually on their merits. Applications must be supported by appro- priate documentation showing that the savings are genuine and that no illegal transfer of capital is involved. Proceeds from the liquidation of the real assets of foreign nationals leaving Ghana may be approved for transfer in one lump sum or may be spread over a period of time, depending on the amount. Loan and overdraft facilities to resident companies controlled by nonresidents require the individual ap- proval of the Bank of Ghana. Residents who are private persons are not normally granted foreign exchange for ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution the acquisition of securities or personal real estate abroad. Transactions in securities are controlled to ensure that capital is not transferred abroad. In respect of portfolio investments, residents must obtain approval for any switch in their holdings of securities issued by nonresidents. Private sector and commercial bank bor- rowing require the approval of the Bank of Ghana, as do private import credits for machinery and equipment valued at US$100,000 or more; foreign borrowing by Ghanaian nationals is subject to certain guidelines by the Government. Lending to nonresidents is prohibited, except for export credits; these require exchange control approval, and normally are limited to 60 days. Under a system of external accounts for debt service payments introduced in 1980 to enable export-oriented industries to get external aid, such industries are allowed to operate foreign exchange accounts (in addition to their regular retention accounts) with funds earmarked from export earnings for the purpose of debt service pay- ments. The opening of such accounts requires the approval of the Committee on Suppliers' Credit and the Exchange Control Department of the Bank of Ghana; the latter also monitors the receipts and payments out of these accounts. Such accounts have been established for the diamond sector as well as for the fishing and timber companies financed with suppliers' credits. Gold Domestic transactions in gold, as well as imports and exports, may be authorized by the State Gold Mining Corporation in collaboration with the Bank of Ghana, and certain domestic sales may be carried out by permit under the Gold Mining Products Protection Ordinance. With these exceptions, Ghanaian residents may not buy GHANA or borrow any gold from, or sell or lend any gold to, any person other than an authorized dealer. Imports of gold other than those by or on behalf of the monetary authorities are not normally licensed. The import duty on bullion, partly worked gold, and other gold is levied at a uniform rate of 30 percent. The gold mines export their output in semirefined form. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement April 19. The exchange rate of the cedi in terms of the U.S. dollar was changed from # 50 = US$1 to # 53 = US$1, representing a depreciation of 5.7 percent. August 12. The exchange rate of the cedi was changed from 0 53 = US$1 to 0 57 = US$1, representing a depreciation of 7.0 percent. October 7. The exchange rate of the cedi was changed from <£ 57 = US$1 to # 60 = US$1, representing a depreciation of 5.0 percent. Nonresident Accounts July 17. A facility for maintaining accounts in convertible foreign currency was introduced. Such ac- counts could be opened by resident and nonresident Ghanaians as well as non-Ghanaians, and could be credited with foreign exchange earnings from all sources other than exports of goods and services originating from Ghana, agency commissions, and discounts on imports into Ghana. Outward transfers of funds in these accounts would be free from exchange restriction. Capital July 13. A new Investment Code, aimed at promoting foreign investments, was promulgated. 247 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GREECE (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Greece is the Greek Drachma. The authorities of Greece operate a managed float for the drachma. On December 31, 1985 buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, in the interbank market were Dr 147.317 and Dr 148.203, respectively, per US$1. Official exchange rates for the U.S. dollar and other currencies1 are determined during the daily fixing session in which the Bank of Greece and the authorized commercial banks participate. A compul- sory commission is charged on all foreign exchange transactions. The commission rate declines from 0.2 percent to 0.0125 percent as the size of the transaction increases from Dr 250,000 to Dr 30 million; no charges are levied on transactions of up to US$150, and the maximum charge of Dr 4,500 is applied only to purchases of foreign exchange. The Bank of Greece offers forward cover in U.S. dollars only, at rates determined by the Bank. Greece is part of the European Monetary System (EMS), but does not participate in the exchange rate mechanism. The drachma is included in the ECU basket. Administration of Control Exchange control policy is the responsibility of the Bank of Greece (the central bank). Under Law No. 936/79, the Ministry of Commerce is responsible for import and export policy. Exchange control is imple- mented and foreign exchange approvals for imports in specified cases are granted by authorized commercial banks. Import and export licenses are also issued by authorized banks. The authorized banks may make exchange settlements relating to most trade transactions and may grant residents a standard travel allowance. They may also make exchange payments for a number of specified transactions in invisibles. Prescription of Currency Settlements with all countries are made in any con- vertible currency or through External Sight Deposit Accounts in convertible drachmas. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents may maintain accounts in Greece, as follows: 1. Deposits in foreign exchange under Legislative Decree No. 2687153. Nonresidents may establish Time Deposit Accounts in foreign currency for a minimum period of six months and with a minimum deposit in convertible currencies equivalent to US$10,000; bal- 1 Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Cyprus pounds, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Irish pounds, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwe- gian kroner, pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. 248 ances on these accounts earn interest not exceeding 8 percent a year. Interest rates vary according to the term of the account, but limits are fixed, as follows: for 6 months to 12 months, 7 percent a year; for 12 months to 24 months, 7.5 percent a year; and for 24 months and over, 8 percent a year. Principal and interest are freely transferable at maturity in the currency of the deposit. 2. External Sight Deposit Accounts in convertible drachmas and in foreign currencies. Nonresidents are permitted to open External Sight Deposit Accounts in convertible drachmas or foreign currencies. Deposit accounts in convertible drachmas are credited with the drachma proceeds of foreign currencies surrendered by a bank to the Bank of Greece against drachmas at the official rate of exchange. Deposits in convertible foreign currency are held by the banks. Any withdrawal from drachma accounts for use in Greece and any conversion of withdrawals from foreign currency accounts into drachmas entail the loss of the reconversion right for the sums withdrawn. At the end of 1985, the maximum rate of interest on such accounts with the banks was 1.5 percent a year. In the case of accounts held by the international organizations in which Greece participates, interest rates are freely determined by the banks. The External Sight Deposit Accounts may be credited with (a) convertible foreign exchange or the proceeds from sales of convertible currencies; (b) authorized payments by residents of Greece for imports or services payable in convertible currencies; (c) transfers from other External Sight Deposit Accounts; and (d) accrued interest on these deposits. They may be debited for (a) payments to residents for current transactions, exports, and services; (b) the purchase and transfer abroad of any convertible currency; and (c) transfers to other External Sight Deposit Accounts. 3. Time Deposit Accounts in convertible foreign exchange. Nonresidents may make time deposits in convertible foreign exchange with banks authorized to deal in foreign exchange. The interest rate is determined freely by the banks according to prevailing rates in the international money markets. 4. Time Deposit Accounts in convertible drachmas. Nonresidents may openTime Deposit Accounts denomi- nated in convertible drachmas for durations of one, three, or six months. The interest rate on such deposits may be freely negotiated. Banks are authorized to make loans in convertible drachmas to credit institutions abroad for periods not exceeding six months, in amounts not exceeding the bank's total deposits in convertible drachmas. 5. Deposits in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, and pounds sterling. Greek citizens (including seamen) working abroad, certain Greek societies and associations operating abroad, and Greek nationals residing abroad may make, with funds originating abroad, deposits in ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, and pounds sterling with authorized banks in Greece. The interest rates are freely determined by the banks, taking into account interest rates applied by the Bank of Greece on the corresponding redeposits; at the end of 1985, the interest rates offered by the Bank of Greece were 8 percent for U.S. dollar accounts, and ranged (depending on deposit maturity) from (a) 9 percent to 9n/i6 percent for accounts in Canadian dollars; and (b) H5/8 percent to I ln/ i6 percent for accounts in pounds sterling. Should the depositor decide at the time of deposit to withdraw accrued interest in drachmas, the interest rate is increased by 1.5 percent- age points annually. The banks are obliged to redeposit with the Bank of Greece at least 70 percent of the increase in such deposits after July 1, 1980, at interest rates set by the Bank of Greece in accordance with developments in the Eurodollar market. The remaining 30 percent can be deposited abroad, with other domestic banks, the Bank of Greece, or placed in other assets with maturity not exceeding 12 months for 70 percent of the total amount of such placements. 6. Deposits in other convertible currencies (excluding U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, and pounds sterling). Greek citizens (including seamen) working abroad and certain Greek societies and associations operating abroad may open, with funds originating abroad, convertible foreign currency accounts in deutsche mark and other currencies (excluding U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, and pounds sterling) with authorized banks in Greece. The period and the other terms of the deposits are freely determined by the banks. The Bank of Greece estab- lishes maximum interest rates for each type and currency of deposit based on developments in the internal money markets of the countries in whose currencies the deposits are denominated. Should the depositor decide at the time of deposit to withdraw accrued interest in drachmas, the interest rate is increased by 1.5 percentage points annually. At the end of 1985 the maximum annual interest rates2 payable on these accounts for some of the currencies ranged from (a) 5 percent to 7.25 percent for accounts in deutsche mark, (b) 7.5 percent to 11 percent for accounts in French francs, (c) 3 percent to 5.25 percent for accounts in Swiss francs, and (d) from 6.75 percent to 9.5 percent for accounts in Belgian francs. Withdrawals in drachmas entail the loss of the reconversion right for the sums withdrawn. The banks are obliged to surrender the entire foreign exchange proceeds to the Bank of Greece at fixed parities in exchange for drachmas. Balances on these accounts, including accrued interest, are freely convertible into foreign exchange against reconversion of drachmas at the same fixed parities that were applied at the time of original conversion. Similar facilities for foreign cur- rency accounts exist under a Housing Loan Deposit Scheme. 2 These are defined as the interest rates for a deposit of the equivalent of US$200,000 in convertible currencies. GREECE The banks are not obliged to redeposit or in any way surrender to the Bank of Greece foreign exchange from the following deposit categories: (i) deposits of shipping (including shipowners), insurance, and construction companies, and of Olympic Airways; and (ii) deposits above the equivalent of US$200,000 for each depositor within the categories mentioned in 5 and 6 above and in all convertible currencies. 7. Blocked Accounts. All drachma assets of nonresi- dents other than those in External Sight and Time Deposit Accounts must be declared and are held in Blocked Accounts. Domestic bank notes in excess of Dr 3,000 brought in by nonresident travelers must also be credited to a Blocked Account, as must certain income accruing in Greece to nonresidents. Subject to the approval of the exchange control authorities, bal- ances on Blocked Accounts held by residents of all countries excluding Turkey and Israel may be used for such purposes as (a) travel expenses for each visit to Greece and personal expenses in Greece up to Dr 200,000 a month of the visitor's stay in Greece and up to Dr 100,000 for other members of his family; for residents of Turkey or Israel, the corresponding limit is Dr 25,000 annually; (b) expenses for buying tickets for a maximum of two trips to Greece by the depositor and other members of his family; (c) expenses for paying taxes and lawyers' fees; and (d) investing in securities officially listed on the stock exchange in Greece and purchasing real estate in Greece. Payments abroad from funds in Blocked Accounts held by residents of countries that have special agreements with Greece3 may be released for remittance if: (a) the money deposited is derived exclusively from rents; in which case amounts of up to US$1,000 (or its equivalent) may be transferred abroad semiannually; or (b) the money deposited is derived exclusively from pensions and the holder has been resident abroad since before January 1, 1981; in which case up to US$300 a month, plus bonuses for New Year, Easter, and vacation, up to a total of US$4,200 annually may be remitted abroad. Funds derived from dividends of postwar public loans and loans of public organizations are freely transferable abroad, and other balances on Blocked Accounts may be transferred abroad if the prior approval of the Bank of Greece is obtained. All transfers between Blocked Accounts re- quire prior approval. The amounts that may be with- drawn from Blocked Accounts differ in cases where the holders do not live in the countries listed in footnote 3. Balances on Blocked Accounts held by private individu- als in the EC member countries are scheduled to be released in six equal annual installments during the period January 1, 1981 to January 1, 1986. Blocked balances may be deposited either with the Bank of Greece, where they bear no interest, or with a 3Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Federal Republic of Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Nether- lands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United King- dom, and United States. 249 ©International Monetary Fund.

Resident Accounts Greek citizens have the option to open accounts in foreign exchange of the types described in paragraphs 5 and 6 above with foreign exchange earned as salaries from work abroad or as payments received for services performed outside Greece. Up to September 30, 1983, time deposit accounts in foreign currencies could be opened with authorized banks in Greece by residents of Greece and by nonprofit legal entities in private law having head offices in Greece, without stating the origin of the funds. Such accounts can be for terms of 1 to 3 months, or 6 or 12 months, with the possibility of renewal. Savings deposit accounts in foreign currency are also permitted. Interest rates are determined by the Bank of Greece on the basis of the rates prevailing in the international money markets. At the end of 1985, the maximum interest rates4 for time deposits ranged (depending on size and maturity of deposit) from (a) 6 percent to 7.85 percent for accounts in U.S. dollars, (b) 6.25 per- cent to 9.0 percent for accounts in Canadian dollars, (c) 10.3 percent for accounts in pounds sterling, and (d) 4.5 percent to 5.2 percent for accounts in deutsche mark. Should the depositor decide at the time of deposit to withdraw accrued interest in drachmas, the interest rate would be increased by 1.5 percentage points annually. The banks are obliged to redeposit the entire foreign exchange with the Bank of Greece. Imports and Import Payments Approval for imports is granted automatically by the commercial banks, and it implies that the neces- sary foreign exchange will be made available. Import approvals may be obtained after shipment has taken place. Import licenses are required for commodities in Lists A—B (including textiles, television receivers and certain foodstuffs, passenger cars, buses, and certain types of machinery and spare parts). Licenses for most of these items are issued automatically; a few items are subject to restrictive licensing. No import licenses are required for most of the items included in Lists A-B (such as textiles, cars, toys, selected types of machinery, car tire tubes, paper, ceramics, and cheese) if they are imported from EC countries. Special regulations govern imports of certain items such as medicines, narcotics, and motion picture films. Goods must be shipped within six months and arrive in Greece within three months of shipment. Final settlement of the value of imported goods must take place within 60 days following the date of arrival at the first Greek port. "These are defined as the interest rates for a deposit in convertible currencies equivalent to US$50,000. 250 A temporary six-month advance deposit scheme is in effect which requires importers to deposit with the intermediary banks amounts equal to either 40 percent or 80 percent of the c . i . f. value of certain categories of imports other than raw materials. These deposits are to be redeposited with the Bank of Greece and not to be redeemed before the expiration of the six-month period. Most imports are subject to a stamp tax of 2.4— 6.0 percent of the c . i . f. duty-paid and tax-paid value. Special regulations govern imports by state agencies, public entities, and public utility companies. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles require approval, which is granted freely for expenses incidental to authorized transactions. Residents traveling abroad for family reasons or tourism are entitled once a year to the equivalent of ECU 720 for travel to EC member countries and US$250 for travel to all other countries. In addition, persons traveling to Cyprus are entitled to an annual foreign exchange allowance of US$450. In lieu of this allow- ance, tourists participating in group tours are granted an amount based on a cost declaration submitted by the travel agency. Commercial banks operating in Greece are authorized to grant foreign exchange for various categories of travelers (e .g ., industrialists, hoteliers, exporters, travel agents, journalists) subject to a certain maximum per diem or per trip limit set by the Bank of Greece. The limits range from US$75-120 a day to US$600-!,200 a trip, depending on the professional category. For allocations beyond these limits, interested parties must submit documentation to the International Transactions Department of the Bank of Greece for approval. For medical treatment abroad, a subcommittee authorizes any amount for transfer direct to a foreign hospital, provided that the relevant bills are submitted. For undergraduate and postgraduate studies, various allocations are authorized, depending on the country of study, such as US$600 and US$660 a month, respec- tively, for the United States; Can$760 and Can$780, respectively, for Canada; £ stg. 290 and £ stg. 350 a month, respectively, for the United Kingdom; and DM 910 and DM 1,070 a month, respectively, for the Federal Republic of Germany. Authorized banks are also empowered to grant foreign exchange up to US$470 to cover the initial expenses of Greek nationals pursuing postgraduate studies abroad. Travelers may take with them a maximum of Dr 3,000 in Greek bank notes. Greek nationals, not including those resident abroad, are required to declare all domes- tic and foreign bank notes and other valuables taken with them upon leaving Greece. On leaving Greece, nonresi- dent travelers may freely take with them up to US$500 in foreign bank notes without having declared them upon entry; the export of larger amounts after a visit of less than 12 months is also not subject to approval, provided that there was a declaration upon entry. Approval is required for larger sums that have been declared if the visit exceeds 12 months. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Payments of interest, profits, and dividends to coun- tries other than EC members are restricted, and special regulations and limits apply to outward remittances of interest, dividends, and profits (see section on Capital, below). Exports and Export Proceeds Almost all exports require individual licenses and are free of quantitative limitation. Export proceeds must be surrendered within 90 days from the date of export of the goods; in special cases, however, the authorities may extend this period by approving time settlement of the value of exports. Industrial exporters can obtain sub- sidies in the form of interest rebates on loans or income tax deductions. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts representing payments for services must be surrendered.5 Exchange proceeds from shipping are exempt from the surrender requirement, but ship- owners must cover their disbursements and expenses in Greece in local currency obtained through the sale of foreign exchange to the Bank of Greece. Travelers may bring in a maximum of Dr 3,000 in Greek bank notes. Any surplus is deposited in a Blocked Account with the Bank of Greece; subject to prior approval by the Bank, the surplus may be taken out on departure or spent in Greece on personal requirements. Greek residents returning to Greece must declare the foreign exchange in their possession if they wish to take it out for the next journey. Nonresident travelers of foreign nationality may import any amount of foreign currency and need not declare it. Nonresidents, includ- ing those who hold Greek passports, are required to declare their foreign exchange only if they intend, when leaving Greece, to take out again foreign exchange in excess of US$500 or its equivalent. Capital Commercial banks and investment banks may borrow convertible currencies abroad, provided that they extend medium-term and long-term loans of equal amounts in foreign currency (or drachma loans with a foreign exchange clause) to productive enterprises established in Greece. All other investments in Greece by nonresidents are subject to approval (mainly for securing repatriation of imported capital). Such approval is automatic for purchases of real estate for personal use, but repatriation of the proceeds of liquidation is subject to the approval of the Bank of Greece. Under Legislative Decree No. 2687/53, approved foreign investments that aim at the promotion of national production or otherwise contribute to the economic advancement of Greece may be granted preferential treatment; this decree also provides for the opening of foreign currency accounts by 5In January 1986, the Bank of Greece introduced a regulation specifying that foreign exchange receipts from tourism should be surrendered within 45 days from the departure of tourists from Greece. GREECE nonresidents and the retransfer of the deposits, as well as the transfer of interest thereon. In accordance with Article 5 of the Legislative Decree No. 2687/53, (1) approved investments may not be repatriated before one year from the date the enterprise begins to operate productively and in no case before one year from the date the capital was imported. (2) The repatriation of foreign capital may not exceed 10 percent a year of the amount of capital imported. The repatri- ation of dividends on equity capital and of interest on loan capital may not exceed 12 percent a year and 10 percent a year, respectively. But under Legislative Decree No. 4256/62, as amended by Law No. 849/78, enterprises engaged in exports are granted higher rates in respect of capital and profit remittances, provided that the total amount required for this purpose does not exceed 30 percent of the foreign exchange earnings of the enterprise from exports during the same year. In the case of loan capital, this provision is applicable on the additional condition that such capital does not exceed twice the share capital of the enterprise and that the remittable amount does not exceed 20 percent annually of loan capital. (3) Both originally and subsequently imported funds for investment capital are considered as imported foreign capital. The total amount or a part of profits realized from foreign capital may also be consid- ered as foreign capital, provided such profits are rein- vested in the enterprise. (4) In cases of leasing of machinery, or other form of foreign capital, the amount of rental is transferable in foreign exchange. If part of the foreign capital imported has been repatriated, the trans- fer of profits is related to the part of the capital remaining in Greece and the transfer privilege expires as soon as all capital has been repatriated. However, for enterprises under Law No. 4171/61 (productive investment exceed- ing Dr 150 million or expansion exceeding Dr 50 mil- lion), a percentage of the profits not exceeding 6 percent annually on the repatriated part of the capital is allowed to be remitted abroad, provided that this percentage is not more than 8 percent of the foreign exchange earnings of the enterprise from the sale of its product abroad. Deviations from the general regulations may be approved for foreign capital imported to develop exports of agricultural and mining products or invested in enterprises of special importance to the economy. Specified foreign short-term investment may also be granted preferential treatment in respect of the repatri- ation of capital and the transfer of interest. Transfers of capital abroad by residents require ap- proval. The purchase abroad of securities or of real estate for personal use is not normally permitted. Gold Residents may freely purchase new gold sovereigns (i.e., those issued since 1974) from the Bank of Greece, through licensed stockbrokers, at prices set by the Bank of Greece; these coins may be resold only to the Bank of Greece or to licensed stockbrokers. Holders of gold coin 251 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GREECE acquired in the free market that existed prior to Decem- ber 22, 1965 may sell these anonymously and without formality to the Bank of Greece or to an authorized bank at the official price. Imports of gold against payment in foreign exchange are on Import List F and require a special license; licenses are normally issued to reputable importers for distribution to recognized users, such as jewelers and dentists. Gold bars and gold coin may be imported freely, for purposes other than commercial, by other residents, as well as by nonresidents when no payment in foreign exchange is involved. Exports of gold other than by the Bank of Greece are not approved, except that gold bars or coin brought in by travelers and declared upon entry may, with the prior approval of the Bank's Credit Subcommittee, be re-exported by the same person. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement June 10. Greece became a participant in the EMS Agreement, but chose not to participate in the EMS exchange rate mechanism. October 11. The drachma was devalued by 15 percent in terms of all currencies. Resident Accounts May 7. Greek nationals permanently living in Greece were permitted to open with the banks savings accounts and time deposit accounts for one to three months in foreign currencies. (Previously only deposit accounts for six or twelve months were permitted.) Imports and Import Payments October 11. With effect from October 14, 1985, a temporary six-month advance deposit scheme for im- ports was introduced, requiring importers to deposit with the intermediary banks amounts equal to 40 percent or 80 percent of the c . i . f. value of specified imports other than raw materials. The deposits would be redeposited with the Bank of Greece in a noninterest bearing account. Measured against the overall import value in 1984, the coverage of the requirement amounted to about 40 percent. November 18. The EC formally concurred with a number of regulations adopted by Greece on its ex- change and trade system. 252 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GRENADA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Grenada is the Eastern Caribbean Dollar,l which is issued by the Eastern Caribbean Cen- tral Bank (ECCB). The Eastern Caribbean dollar is pegged to the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, at EC$2.70 = US$1. The ECCB also quotes daily rates for the Canadian dollar and the pound sterling. A 5 percent exchange tax2 is levied on all sales of foreign exchange by commercial banks, except for payments for imports of some basic foods and drugs. Administration of Control Exchange control applies to all countries. It is ad- ministered by the Ministry of Planning, Finance, and Trade. The Ministry delegates to authorized dealers the authority to approve some import payments and certain other outward payments. The exchange control direct- ives do not apply to transactions with South Africa. Trade controls also are administered by the Ministry of Planning, Finance, and Trade. Prescription of Currency Settlements with residents of member countries of the Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM)3 must be made either through External Accounts (in Eastern Caribbean dollars) or in the currency of the CARICOM country concerned. Settlements with residents of the former Sterling Area countries, other than CARICOM countries, may be made in sterling, in any other former Sterling Area currency, or in Eastern Caribbean dollars to and from External Accounts. Settlements with residents of countries outside the former Sterling Area other than South Africa may be made in any foreign currency4 or through an External Account in Eastern Caribbean dollars. Nonresident Accounts External Accounts may be opened for nonresidents by authorized dealers without reference to the Ministry of Planning, Finance, and Trade.

They may be credited with proceeds from the sale of foreign curren- cies, with transfers from other External Accounts, with bank interest (payable on External Accounts), and with 'The Eastern Caribbean dollar is also the currency of Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Montserrat, St. Christopher and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. 2As part of the measures introduced under the 1986 budget, the foreign exchange tax has been reduced to 2 percent, with effect from February 28, 1986. 3The CARICOM countries are Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Chris- topher and Nev is, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. 4 Foreign currencies comprise all currencies other than the Eastern Caribbean dollar. payments by residents for which general or specific permission has been given by the Ministry. They may be debited for payments to residents of Grenada, for the cost of foreign exchange required for travel or business purposes, and for any other payments covered by delegated authority to authorized dealers. Other debits and any overdrafts require individual approval. Foreign Currency Accounts Residents and nonresidents are permitted to open foreign currency accounts. Such accounts may be freely debited, but can be credited only with foreign exchange earned or received from outside the ECCB area. Imports and Import Payments All imports from South Africa are prohibited. Most goods may be freely imported under open general license from all other countries. Certain other commodities require individual licenses. Payments for documented imports are free of restric- tions. Payments for other authorized imports are per- mitted upon application and submission of documentary evidence (invoices and customs warrants) to the Ministry of Planning, Finance, and Trade. Advance payments for imports also require prior approval by this Ministry. Imports of equipment, spare parts, and raw materials for the manufacture of approved goods are exempted from import duties. Imports not exempt from customs duty are subject to a stamp tax5 of 15 percent of the c . i .f. value, as well as to an international airport levy amounting to 5 percent of c . i . f. value. Payments for Invisibles With the exception of outward remittances for educa- tion, medical treatment, gifts, family maintenance, profits, dividends, insurance premiums, and proceeds from sales of local property, royalties, and management fees, payments for invisibles require exchange control approval. Authority has been delegated to authorized dealers to provide basic allocations of foreign exchange for a few types of payments. These include foreign travel (for which up to EC$5,000 a person a calendar year may be allocated for private travel and up to EC$ 10,000 a person for business travel), subscriptions to magazines and periodicals, and life insurance premiums on policies contracted before June 1975.

Applications in respect of tourism in excess of EC$5,000 a person are considered on their merits. The cost of transportation to any destination may be settled in domestic currency and is not deducted from the travel allocation. Nonresident travelers may export any foreign currency previously brought in with the approval of the Ministry of Planning, Finance, and Trade. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to South Africa are prohibited, and specific licenses are required for the export of certain goods to any destination. There are no formal regulations to ensure that export proceeds in foreign currencies are surrendered within a certain period from the date of shipment, but the collection of export proceeds is mandatory. No export duties are applied. Proceeds from Invisibles The collection of the foreign currency proceeds from invisibles is mandatory. Travelers may bring in freely notes and coin in Eastern Caribbean currency or in any foreign currency. Capital All outward capital transfers require exchange control approval. The purchase by residents of foreign currency securities and of real estate abroad for private purposes is not normally permitted. Certificates of title to foreign currency securities held by residents must be lodged with an authorized depository in Grenada, and earnings on these securities must be repatriated. Personal capital transfers, such as inheritances to nonresidents, require exchange control approval, which normally is granted subject to the payment of estate and succession duties. There are certain allowances for cash gifts (EC$500 a person a year) and for emigration purposes. The Ministry of Planning, Finance, and Trade will also consider transfer applications from foreign nationals who have resided in Grenada and are proceed- ing to take up permanent residence abroad. Direct investment in Grenada by nonresidents may be made with exchange control approval. The remittance of earnings on, and liquidation proceeds from, such invest- ment is permitted, provided that all liabilities related to the investment have been discharged and that the original investment was registered with the Ministry of Planning, Finance, and Trade. Nonresidents may acquire in Grenada real estate for private purposes with funds in foreign currency; local currency financing is not ordinar- ily permitted. The repatriation of the proceeds from the realization of such investments requires the approval of the Ministry of Planning, Finance, and Trade. The approval of the Ministry is required for residents to borrow abroad or for nonresidents to borrow in Grenada. Authorized dealers may freely assume short- term liability positions in foreign currencies for the financing of approved transfers in respect of both trade and nontrade transactions. They may also freely accept deposits from nonresidents. Any borrowing abroad by authorized dealers to finance their domestic operations requires the approval of the Ministry. Gold Residents who are private persons are permitted to acquire and hold gold coins for numismatic purposes only. Residents other than the monetary authorities, authorized dealers, and industrial users are not permitted to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry or coins for numismatic purposes. Imports of gold are permitted for industrial purposes only and are subject to customs duties and charges. Licenses to import gold are issued by the Ministry of Planning, Finance, and Trade. The export of gold is not normally permitted. Changes During 1985 Imports and Import Payments During the year, importation of a wide range of commodities was liberalized, including confectionery, chemical products and fertilizers, electrical appliances and equipment, motor vehicles, steel products, timber products, and specified parts of automobiles. 254 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GUATEMALA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Guatemala is the Guatemalan Quet- zal. Guatemala maintains a three-tier exchange rate system: in the "official" market, the exchange rate is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at the rate of Q 1 = US$1; in the "free" market (the banking market), the rate is determined by market supply and demand; in the third or "auction" market (subdivided into two segments, see below), the rate in principle fluctuates according to market forces but also may be set by the Central Bank (Bank of Guatemala), taking into account developments in the second market. In the official market the Central Bank buys foreign exchange at the rate of Q 1 = US$1; eligible transactions at this rate include: (a) foreign exchange proceeds from official borrowing; (b) foreign exchange earnings from exports of sugar under quotas, bananas, and petroleum; 90 percent of export proceeds from cardamom; 75 per- cent of export proceeds from coffee; and 50 percent of those from cotton, and meat, as well as all other exports to destinations outside the Central American Common Market (CACM); (c) payments for imports defined as essential by the Government; (d) payments of principal and interest on external public debt; and (e) all other official transactions, except imports of goods and allow- ances for official travel. All other transactions take place in the banking market at a fluctuating rate. In the "auction" market, the Bank of Guatemala is empowered to sell foreign exchange on an occasional basis for use in importing certain products designated by the Bank; the rate in this market might either result from a bidding process or be set by the Bank of Guatemala, taking into account the value of the quetzal in the banking market. The auction market operates in two segments as follows: the "auction market for borrowed resources" utilizes the proceeds of special foreign loans valued at the banking market rate to provide foreign exchange for certain imports specified in loan contracts. Under the "auction market for export proceeds," the Bank of Guatemala purchases export proceeds from the banking market at the prevailing rate and auctions the foreign exchange for the importation of specified products. Authorized banks may operate in the banking market. For export proceeds, sellers of foreign exchange through this market receive domestic currency at the official rate plus a negotiable certificate denominated in U.S. dollars for an amount equivalent to the value of foreign exchange surrendered; the certificate may be sold in the local market, and the purchaser is allowed to buy the specified amount of foreign exchange at the official rate in the local banks. Exchange certificates have a maturity of eight days. On December 30, 1985 the buying and selling rates in the banking market (including the premium for the exchange certificate) were Q 2.91 and Q 2.93 per U .S. dollar, respectively. At the last auction in 1985 (i.e., the one on December 17, 1985), the clearing rate was Q 2.65 = US$1. Buying and selling rates for certain other currencies1 are also officially quoted, mainly on the basis of their rates in the New York market. A tax of 3.5 percent is required on international transactions for the following operations with foreign exchange: (i) imports and ex- ports; and (ii) payments for and proceeds from invisibles such as: transfers of dividends, profits, interest, publish- ing, salaries, family remittances, and remittances for students. The international public or private institutions, petroleum companies, diplomatic missions, and the public sector are exempt from such tax. On January 27, 1947 Guatemala formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control The Foreign Exchange Department of the Bank of Guatemala is in charge of administering the Emergency Regime for controlling international transfers. Foreign exchange transactions of the public sector are carried out exclusively through the Bank of Guatemala; those of the private sector are made through banks authorized by the Monetary Board. Essential payments in foreign currency must be approved by the Foreign Exchange Department; banks participating in the system may authorize some foreign payments under powers delegated by the Bank of Guatemala. Exports of goods and services must be registered in the Foreign Exchange Department to guarantee the repatriation of the corresponding foreign exchange proceeds. Prescription of Currency In practice, most transactions in foreign exchange are denominated in U.S. dollars. Transactions with three other member countries of the CACM2 are carried out in national currencies through the Central American Clearing House; clearing settlements are made in U.S. dollars. Transactions with Nicaragua are carried out in U.S. dollars. Imports and Import Payments Imports originating outside the Central American region which qualify for foreign exchange at the official rate of Q 1 = US$1 are subject to prior licensing from the Bank of Guatemala. Imports of items considered "essential" by the Government and which may be effected at this rate include some basic foodstuffs, medicines and pharmaceutical products, basic inputs for 'Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Mexican pesos, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. 2Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Honduras. 255 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GUATEMALA agriculture, and most fuels and lubricants. All other imports should be effected through the banking or auction markets. Imports of goods from Nicaragua through barter operations approved by the Bank of Guatemala require registration with the Ministry of Economy. Import licenses issued by the Ministry of Economy are required for imports of maps of Guatemala, coffee beans and coffee plants, explosives, lead, poultry, milk, eggs, sugar, wheat flour, basic food grains, cottonseed, tallow, and a few other goods. Imports of cacao are prohibited from all sources. Imports from Honduras are regulated by a bilateral trade agreement. All merchandise imports must be registered with the Foreign Exchange Depart- ment or one of the authorized banks (imports from El Salvador and Costa Rica, which are covered by the General Treaty for Economic Integration of Central America, are exempt from this requirement); the Bank of Guatemala will issue foreign exchange licenses either against letters of credit and prepayments or against original bills of lading and invoices with statistical information consistent with the import registration. Except in the case of imports made directly by autho- rized banks on behalf of importers with letters of credit or trade credits, a 25 percent guarantee deposit, to be made at the time of the request for foreign exchange, is required in the case of prepayments for imports. De- posits may be made in cash, bank guarantees, or government bonds and are refundable when the Bank of Guatemala has received from the importer a document issued by customs verifying the arrival of the merchan- dise. In the case of imports made through particular letters of credit, a minimum of 60 percent guarantee deposit is required, but imports made through credit lines are exempted. Requests for payments by the public sector are exempted from this purchase requirement. Under the provision of the Central American Agree- ment on Fiscal Incentives, Guatemala grants duty exon- erations on imports of raw materials and capital goods to approved industrial firms. Imports originating outside the Central American Common Market are subject to an import surcharge of 30 percent of the applicable import duty. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Interest payments on public external debt as well as all other official payments and receipts are effected at the "official" rate of Q 1 = US$1. Invisible transactions effected through the auction market are: (a) remittances abroad for studies at university or equivalent level that must be approved by the Exchange Department of the Bank of Guatemala covering the following expenses: (i) tuition and related payments, (ii) once-a-year round trip transportation, (iii) an initial allowance equivalent to Q 1,000 for settlement, and (iv) monthly remittances of up to the equivalent of Q 500, which may be increased by up to Q 300 in duly justified cases; (b) payments for medical treatment abroad that may also be approved in advance by the Exchange Department, including that needed for transportation and hospitalization expenses; 256 in duly justified cases, foreign exchange to cover expenses of an additional person may be provided; at the time of the advance request for foreign exchange for medical treatment abroad, a 25 percent guarantee deposit should be constituted in the form of cash, bank guaran- tees, or government bonds with the guarantee deposit being refundable at the time of presentation of docu- ments justifying the use of foreign exchange abroad; and (c) expenses for official travelers. All other current invisible transactions may be effected without limit through the banking market. Exports and Export Proceeds Certain exports are subject to licenses issued by the Ministry of Economy. Exports of a few other items are prohibited, including the export of gold (unless the Bank of Guatemala issues a special export license) and silver in any form. Travelers may, however, take out up to Q 25 in silver coin that is legal tender in foreign countries. Exporters must obtain an export permit issued by the Foreign Exchange Department before the Guate- malan customs can authorize shipment of the merchan- dise; the granting of export permits is contingent on agreement to sell export proceeds to the Bank of Guatemala or an authorized bank within 11/2 to 3 months of the date of issuance. Exchange earnings from some categories of exports are required to be surrendered to the Bank of Guatemala at the rate of Q 1 = US$1 as follows: (a) 100 percent of proceeds from sugar exports to quota markets, and from exports of bananas and petroleum; (b) 75 percent of proceeds from coffee exports to quota markets; (c) 90 percent of proceeds from cardamom exports; and (d) 50 percent of proceeds from cotton exports to all markets and from meat and nontraditional exports to destinations outside Central America. All other export proceeds may be converted at the banking market rate. Capital Proceeds from official external borrowing and prin- cipal repayments on the external debt of the public sector are effected at the rate of Q 1 = US$1. All other capi- tal transactions take place at the rate in the banking market without limitations. All investment by foreign or foreign-controlled companies in the construction of private housing in Guatemala requires the prior approval of the Ministry of Economy. Investment in the petroleum sector is governed by special legislation. Gold The Bank of Guatemala is obliged to purchase all gold offered to it, either directly or through the banks, and is entitled to require the surrender, directly or through authorized banks, of the gold holdings of any resident. The Bank sells gold to domestic artistic or industrial users, in accordance with directives of the Monetary Board. The export of gold is prohibited except when the Bank of Guatemala issues a special export license. Gold is imported only by the Bank of Guatemala. ©International Monetary Fund.

Under this scheme, which supplemented the existing "auction market for borrowed resources," the Bank of Guatemala would purchase at the prevailing rate all export proceeds accruing to the banking system and auction them to importers of certain priority products. July 1. A tax of 3.5 percent was introduced on foreign exchange operations for the following transactions: (a) imports and exports, and (b) payments for and proceeds from invisibles such as transfers of dividends, profits, interest, publishing, salaries, family remittances, and remittances for students. The international public or private institutions, petroleum companies, diplomatic missions, and the public sector are exempt from such tax. Imports and Import Payments February 21. Access to the auction market up to specified proportions was authorized for settlement of the following types of imports: (a) agricultural inputs ineligible for settlement at the official market; (b) inputs for use in the production of exports to markets outside Central America; and (c) industrial raw materials. July 2. It was announced that foreign exchange settle- ment for the following import items should henceforth be effected through the banking market: powdered milk and dietetic foods, tallow, some other basic foodstuffs, printed matter and paper, equipment for agricultural machinery, and government imports. These imports were previously effected through the official market. September 13. Settlement through the official market was authorized for edible oil imports financed under the PL 480 program, up to the equivalent of US$5 million, and for the duration of the marketing of the 1985/86 cottonseed crop.

The exchange rate in the official market is pegged to the SDR at GS 24.6853 = SDR I .2 Only foreign exchange transac- tions of the public sector and the mining companies take place at the official exchange rate. The exchange rate in the second market is GS 36 per F 1 (or GS 0.72 = CFA I ) .3 Individuals and nonbank institutions can sell but cannot buy foreign exchange in the second market.4 Operations authorized at the second rate include: capital inflows for investment and nonmining export receipts, grants, expenditures for tourist and business purposes, and transfers and sales of instruments of payment denominated in foreign exchange. In the official market, exchange rates for 16 curren- cies5 quoted by the Central Bank of the Republic of Guinea are determined on the basis of the value of the syli in terms of the SDR and the transaction value of these currencies in terms of the SDR.6 The exchange rate for the CFA franc results from the relationship between this currency and the French franc. Settlements under the bilateral payments agreement with the People's Republic of China are effected in renminbi at the rate of GS 10.030 per Y I .7 In the second market, exchange rates for 15 currencies8 other than the French franc are determined by the central bank on the basis of the value of the syli in terms of French francs (see footnote 6) and the rates for the currencies concerned in the international markets. !On January 6, 1986 the Guinean Syli was replaced at par by the Guinean franc (GF). 2On January 6, 1986 the official exchange rate was changed from GS 22.60 = US$1 to GS 300 = US$1, representing a devaluation of 92.47 percent. 3On January 6, 1986 the exchange rate in the second market was changed from the equivalent of GS 22.60 = US$1 to GS 340 = US$1; beginning from January 28, 1986, it is determined through a weekly foreign exchange auction. 4Beginning from January 28, 1986, all transactions (both purchases and sales) other than those of the public sector and the mining companies are required to be effected in the second foreign exchange market. 5Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Saudi Arabian riyals, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. 6Beginning from January 6, 1986, quotation of the exchange rate of the Guinean franc is in terms of the U.S. dollar; the rates for other currencies are determined on the basis of their U .S. dollar rates in international markets. 7Beginning from January 6, 1986, settlements under the bilateral payments agreement with the People's Republic of China have been settled at the rate resulting from the current GS/U.S. dollar and U.S. dollar/Y rates. 8Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guil- ders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Saudi Arabian riyals, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and U .S. dollars. 258 Administration of Control Exchange control authority is vested in the Central Bank, which is under the direct supervision of the Presidency. The Bank has not delegated any of its exchange control powers. All settlements with foreign countries, including payments for imports, require ap- proval by the Central Exchange Bureau of the Central Bank. Import and export licenses are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Trade. Prescription of Currency Settlements on account of transactions covered by bilateral payments agreements are made in currencies prescribed by, and through accounts established under, the provisions of the agreements.9 Settlements with the Central Bank of West African States (for Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'lvoire, Niger, Senegal, and Togo) and The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauri- tania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are normally made through the West African Clearing House. Settlements with other countries are made in designated "convert- ible" currencies quoted by the Central Bank. Resident Foreign Currency Accounts Guinean residents may open deposit accounts in foreign currency with local commercial banks. Use of drawings from these accounts is limited to import financing and payments for specified services. Nonresident Accounts There are two types of nonresident accounts: Nonresi- dent Transferable Accounts in Foreign Currencies, and Nonresident Accounts in Sylis. The opening of a nonresident account is subject to the prior approval of the Central Bank. Imports and Import Payments Import licenses are of two types: "licenses with settlement" and "licenses without settlement" (i.e., imports are financed by the importers' own foreign exchange). The first type of license is mainly for those imports of the public enterprises and ministries that are part of the import program; the second type of license is for the private sector imports. An annual program of imports is presented by each public enterprise and forwarded to the respective minis- try, which aggregates its overall import needs before forwarding them to the Minister of Foreign Trade. These requests are discussed by an interministerial committee {commission de controle des licenses), which has the 9Guinea maintains bilateral payments agreements with the People's Republic of China, Cuba, and Viet Nam; all but the agreement with China are inoperative. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ultimate authority to decide on the final composition of mports; on this basis, annual import quotas are allocated to each ministry. If one ministry's requirements were to exceed its quota, it would have to make a special request to the interministerial committee; the determining crite- rion in such cases is the urgency of the need. In any case, any extra amount allowed beyond the original quota would normally be deducted from the quota for the following year. The execution of the import program is closely monitored to ensure that actual imports comply with the authorities' imports. Should the foreign ex- change situation permit, an annual program could be expanded in favor of the import of necessities. Once a license with official settlement has been issued, authorization for the corresponding payment is granted by the Central Exchange Bureau. Imports by foreign concession holders require import licenses for statistical purposes only and are not restricted. The annual import program takes into consideration the sources of imports and the availability of convertible currencies and of balances under payments agreements. Certain imports, including most private sector im- ports, are effected outside the import program. This category comprises goods for which foreign exchange is derived from sources other than the official foreign exchange resources of Guinea and covers mainly imports by three "mixed-economy companies" (the Friguia Com- pany, the Guinea Bauxite Company, and AREDOR, the diamond company), the foreign embassies, imports made directly for the execution of the Five-Year Plan, and imports by private traders not involving purchase of foreign exchange through the official market ( i .e ., without official settlement).10 Licenses are issued for imports without official settlement. Pharmaceutical sup- plies and fuel can be imported only through the official channel by the public sector. All commodities are subject to import surcharges, except when imported by the mixed-economy companies. n Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles through the official foreign exchange market require the authorization of the Central Bank. Payments for freight and insurance in connection with imports are authorized as part of the import license. No official exchange is granted for other types of insurance with companies abroad. There is no official exchange allocation for tourist or business travel; each application is considered individually .12 Government 10Beginning with the first auction on January 28, 1986, private sector importers can freely obtain "licenses with official settlement" for imports to be financed with foreign exchange purchased through the foreign exchange auction. 11 On January 6, 1986 all import tariffs, duties, and other import- related taxes were replaced by a simplified tariff system as follows: rice was made subject to a zero tariff; a 5 percent tariff was levied on certain primary foodstuffs, including edible oils, wheat flour, sugar, meat and fowl; and all other imports were made subject to a 10 percent tariff. In addition, a surtax of 20 percent or 30 percent was imposed on all luxury goods. The import tariff payable by two mixed enterprises in the mining sector remained subject to special agreements. 12During the first quarter of 1986, transportation-related bids for foreign exchange in the auction market were permitted but only in the form of invoices issued by the foreign airlines. GUINEA officials on official missions are permitted an allowance of US$60 a day. Pilgrims are granted exchange up to the equivalent of GS 16,351 for each pilgrimage and, in addition, up to GS 22,000 to pay for fares. In cases of serious illness, when a doctor's certificate is submitted, residents may be granted foreign exchange for medical care abroad or they may be permitted to transfer exchange for the care of relatives receiving medical treatment abroad. Individual authorization is required for the payment in Guinea of all fares for foreign travel. Payments for family support through the official market may be made up to monthly amounts determined on the merits of the case; for officially recognized study abroad, the allocation is the equivalent of the amount of a government scholarship, that is, US$100 a month, but students beginning their studies abroad are granted an additional foreign exchange allowance of up to US$150. The Investment Law of 1985 guarantees that most profits on approved foreign investments may be transferred abroad; the percentage actually permitted may vary depending on the agreement concluded between the enterprise concerned and the Government. Expatriate workers employed by the public sector in Guinea may transfer abroad through the official market 40 percent of their net monthly salaries, and those employed by the private sector are permitted to transfer up to 30 percent of their net monthly salaries on the same basis. The export of Guinean currency is prohibited. Exports and Export Proceeds The Minister of Foreign Trade establishes an annual export program for all public sector exports except those of the mixed-economy companies. All exports require individual licenses in order to (1) assure the implementation of the export program (particularly in respect of commitments under bilateral trade agreements); (2) permit the Treasury to levy certain duties (e .g ., special taxes payable in foreign exchange are levied on the volume of bauxite and alumina exported); (3) prevent shortages of goods needed for domestic consumption; and (4) prevent the export of capital. For the following commodities, special authori- zation from designated agencies is required in addition to the export license: wild animals (dead or alive), edible animals, articles of historic or ethnographic interest, jewelry, articles made of precious metals, and plants and seeds. Foreign planters may be granted special transfer privileges related to the quantity of pineapples, bananas, or citrus fruits exported, and private traders may also be permitted to retain a part of their export proceeds in order to finance authorized imports. The mixed-economy companies are allowed to retain their export proceeds abroad, to pay for their imports and operating require- ments, and to service their external debt. Proceeds from Invisibles In principle, exchange proceeds accruing to residents in respect of invisibles are required to be surrendered. The import of foreign bank notes and traveler's checks is permitted freely, subject to declaration on entry; 259 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GUINEA however, both must be surrendered by residents within 24 hours after entry. Nonresident travelers may re-export the foreign exchange declared upon entry, after deduc- tion of their local expenditures; this deduction may not be less than the equivalent of US$20 for each day of their stay, unless evidence can be produced to show that actual expenditure was less. The import of Guinean currency is prohibited. Capital All capital transfers through the official market require authorization. Outward capital transfers by Guinean nationals through the official market are prohibited. The Investment Law of 1985 provides guarantees against the nationalization of foreign investments in the industrial and mining sectors. It also provides for preferential tax and customs treatment applicable to foreign investments and for the transfer of profits, interest, amortization, and liquidation proceeds of such investments. Small- and medium-sized enterprises in which at least GS 50 million is invested over a three-year period may receive import tax reductions and exemp- tions from other taxes for a period of eight to ten years. Exemptions for up to 15 years may be granted on long- term investments of particular importance to the econ- omy. The minimum foreign investment in Guinean enterprises is GS 10 million. Guinean nationals must have controlling interests in enterprises requiring foreign investment of GS 10 million to GS 50 million. There are arrears on external payments, mostly in respect of debt service payments. purposes. With these exceptions, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than artisanal gold or jewelry, at home or abroad. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement October 7. A second exchange market was in- troduced, with a fixed rate of GS 36 = F 1, versus a French franc equivalent of GS 2.879 = F 1 in the official market. Individuals and nonbank institutions could sell but not buy foreign exchange in the second market. Permissible foreign exchange sales included those in respect of capital inflows for investment, nonmining export receipts, grants, expenditures for tourist and business purposes, transfers, and sales of instruments of payment denominated in foreign exchange. All foreign exchange purchases by dealers in the second market were required to be surrendered to the Central Bank. Imports and Import Payments April 17. All tariffs, surcharges, and import taxes on rice, edible oils, sugar, wheat, tomatoes, milk, and meat were eliminated. In addition, all tariffs, surcharges, and import taxes on cement, steel sheet, and construction materials made of either wood or steel were reduced by 50 percent. Proceeds from Invisibles May 12. Authorization was granted for residents to hold foreign currency accounts. Gold Guinea has four issues of commemorative gold coin, which are legal tender. Furthermore, residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Guinea for numismatic Exports and Export Proceeds January 1. Authorization to mine gold and diamonds in Guinea was limited to government and mixed- economy companies. 260 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GUINEA-BISSAU (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Guinea-Bissau is the Guinea-Bissau Peso. Guinea-Bissau follows a flexible exchange rate policy under which the exchange rate of the Guinea- Bissau peso in terms of the SDR is adjusted at relatively short intervals on the basis of domestic price devel- opments, external market conditions, export trends, and the overall balance of payments position. Daily buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, and for other foreign currencies are fixed within margins of 2.25 percent of the SDR rate for the Guinea-Bissau peso. On December 31, 1985 the buying and selling rates of the National Bank of Guinea-Bissau (the central bank) for the U .S. dollar were PG 174.72 and PG 175.37, respectively, per US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Foreign exchange transactions are under the control of the National Bank of Guinea-Bissau (the central bank). Foreign exchange proceeds must be surrendered to the central bank. Residents must declare to the central bank all their physical assets and foreign exchange holdings abroad. Prescription of Currency Settlements with all foreign countries must be made in foreign currency. The central bank may prescribe the currency in which export earnings shall be received. Guinea-Bissau maintains a bilateral payments agreement with Algeria. Settlements with the Central Bank of West African States (for Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'lvoire, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo) and The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are normally made through the West African Clearing House. Imports and Import Payments All imports are subject to prior licensing. In principle, licenses are issued by the Ministry of Commerce and Tourism in line with availability of foreign exchange and on the basis of a program agreed between the central bank and the Ministry of Commerce and Tourism. Li- censes are valid for the period of the import transaction. Licenses granted have to be presented to the central bank within 15 days. Only importers registered with the Ministry of Commerce and Tourism may receive li- censes. Each license specifies the quantity and value (c.i.f. and f .o .b .) of the product imported, and a separate license is required for each product. Retail traders receive imported products in proportion to their exports of agricultural products, and private exporters of non- traditional products are authorized to use up to 70 per- cent of their foreign exchange receipts to pay for merchandise imports. Licenses for project-related im- ports financed by foreign loans or grants are granted automatically. Import licenses are normally provided within 8 to 15 days of a documented request. Imports of essential foodstuffs, such as rice and sugar, are state monopolies. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require the prior approval of the Committee of Foreign Exchange Control. Foreign exchange allocations for many payments for invisibles, including those for tourism and for the purchase of stocks, bonds, real estate, and profit remittances, have been temporarily suspended. Transfers of pension pay- ments are authorized in accordance with specific criteria. Although no foreign exchange may be purchased for tourism, airplane tickets can be bought using domestic currency. Airline companies may transfer in foreign exchange the difference between their payments and receipts in Guinea-Bissau pesos. These transfers are approved on an ad hoc basis. Foreign exchange allowances for business travel are limited to PG 50,000 a trip. Beginning October 1985, foreign exchange for study abroad is set in Portuguese escudos and is granted up to ESc 17,000 each month (ESc 13,800 for high school students). Allowances for travel for health reasons are permitted up to ESc 80,000. Remittances to close relatives (parents and children) living abroad are permitted. Foreign travelers may take out any remaining foreign currency declared upon entry. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports require an export license. Only exporters registered with the Ministry of Commerce and Tourism may obtain export licenses, which are granted automati- cally in most cases. Exports of groundnuts and cashew nuts are reserved for the Government and are effected by two state companies, the People's Stores and SOCOMI. Other products exported only by the Government include palm kernels, sawn wood and logs, shrimp, fish, beer, nonalcoholic beverages, groundnut oil, and parquet flooring. Private exporters of nontraditional products are authorized to use up to 70 percent of their foreign exchange receipts to pay for merchandise imports. All exports are subject to a general fee of 1 percent, and certain exports are also subject to export taxes. All export proceeds must be surrendered to the central bank. A special regime applies to exports destined for countries of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Proceeds from Invisibles Travelers may bring in any amount of foreign cur- rency. Foreign airline companies must cover the excess of their expenditures over revenues in Guinea-Bissau 261 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GUINEA-BISSAU pesos by transfers from abroad or by the sale of their foreign exchange receipts for Guinea-Bissau pesos. All proceeds from invisibles must be surrendered to the central bank. Capital Foreign investment operations are guided by the Investment Code introduced in 1980. Under this Code, which is being reviewed, exchange control is exercised over capital receipts and payments. Capital transfers associated with emigration are authorized by the "transi- tory norms" within a monthly limit of PG 50,000 and up to 20 percent of total taxable income earned during a period of not more than ten years. At present, however, such transfers are suspended. Gold Exports and imports of gold are prohibited, except when authorized by the Head of State and the Ministry of Finance. Changes During 1985 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 262 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GUYANA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Guyana is the Guyana Dollar, which is pegged to a basket of currencies consisting of the pound sterling, the deutsche mark, the Japanese yen, the French franc, and the Netherlands guilder. The external value of the Guyana dollar in terms of the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is announced on a weekly basis. Buying and selling rates for certain other curren- cies1 are also officially quoted, with daily quotations based on the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar in markets abroad. The Bank of Guyana (the central bank) charges commissions at different rates on the purchase and sale of the officially quoted currencies. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Guyana formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from December 27, 1966. Administration of Control Exchange control authority is vested in the Minister of Finance who has entrusted its administration to the Bank of Guyana. Authority for approving current payments up to specified amounts is delegated to the banks authorized for this purpose; all other import payments and certain payments in respect of current invisibles of a personal nature require the approval of the Bank of Guyana. The Ministry of Trade and Consumer Protection is responsi- ble for issuing import and export licenses, but import licenses require the endorsement of the Bank of Guyana. Prescription of Currency Exchange control applies to all countries, and all currencies other than the Guyana dollar are considered foreign currencies. Authorized payments, including pay- ments for imports, by residents of Guyana to residents of countries outside Guyana may be made in any foreign currency or in Guyana dollars to the credit of an External Account in Guyana. Receipts from countries outside Guyana may be obtained in any foreign currency (in any listed specified currency2 for export proceeds) or in Guyana dollars from an External Account. Nonresident Accounts There are two categories of accounts for persons who are not residents of Guyana: External Accounts and Blocked Accounts. External Accounts may be opened, with exchange control approval, for persons resident outside Guyana. 'Barbados dollars, Canadian dollars, Eastern Caribbean dollars, Jamaica dollars, pounds sterling, and Trinidad and Tobago dollars. 2Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and U .S. dollars. They may be credited freely with all authorized pay- ments by residents of Guyana to nonresidents and with transfers from other External Accounts; other credits require approval. They may be debited freely for payments for any purpose to residents of any country, for transfers to other External Accounts, and for withdraw- als by the account holder while he is in Guyana; other debits require approval. Blocked Accounts may, in principle, be credited with funds that are not placed at the free disposal of nonresidents (e .g ., certain capital proceeds); these ac- counts may be debited for certain authorized payments, including the purchase of approved securities. Since mid-1978 Blocked Accounts have been used to hold domestic currency deposits equivalent in value to pend- ing applications for foreign exchange. Such deposits carry a market-related interest rate. The Bank of Guyana provides an exchange guarantee for the deposits con- stituted before the devaluation of January 1984, but the deposits constituted after the devaluation are not guaranteed. Imports and Import Payments All imports from or that transit South Africa are prohibited. Imports of certain other commodities are also prohibited from all sources. Permissible imports are subject to individual licensing, but the following com- modities are exempted: passenger's baggage, household effects and personal effects, bona fide patterns and samples that have a stipulated f .o .b. value, parcel post items of a certain value imported by individuals, and gifts subject to certain conditions. In addition, from May 1, 1982 a scheme was to be introduced under which a manufacturer would be permitted to import spare parts up to c . i . f. value of G$5,000 and any items of equipment or machinery up to c . i . f. value of G$l0,000 without having to apply for an import license, provided that no foreign exchange from Guyana would be required to pay for the imports; however, so far the scheme has not become operational. An import license is granted on a relatively free but priority basis as follows: (1) raw materials for the manufacture of essential items; (2) essential items; (3) raw materials for manufacturers serving the export markets and the essential services in industry; (4) equipment and materials for sawmills in the timber industry; (5) commodities for hatcheries; (6) spare parts; (7) petroleum products; (8) importation by international organizations and diplomatic personnel; and (9) drugs. However, an application for an import license will not normally be approved for commodities when similar ones are produced locally and at reasonable levels to supply domestic needs or sustain exportation. Public sector corporations have a monopoly over the importation of specified commodities from all sources. Import licenses are issued in respect of certain specified 263 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GUYANA commodities only to the government corporation that has been identified to procure them centrally. When the reponsibility of handling imports of any commodity has been given to a single government agency with a view to eliminating duplication of ordering between such agen- cies, the relevant licenses are issued only to that corporation. A similar course of action is adopted when standardization of commodities is involved. As a general rule, licenses are issued only to government corporations for the procurement of supplies for the retail and distributive sectors of the economy on a national, rather than a local, basis. Licenses are not normally made available to private sector concerns or individuals for goods to be disposed of by retail trade, other than to dealers in spare parts. Import licenses continue to be approved for specialized requirements of government and private concerns connected with sugar, bauxite, rice, timber, and manufacturing industries, as the case may be. There are no import quotas, but the granting of import licenses is subject in large measure to the availability of foreign exchange. In general, applications for licenses not involving use of official foreign exchange (i.e., "no funds" licenses) are granted on a relatively liberal basis; most imports of consumer goods take place on this basis. Applications for no funds licenses for imports of produc- tion inputs by local companies able to arrange their own financing abroad are granted freely. All applications for foreign exchange must be accompanied by a domestic currency deposit of equivalent value, to be held in blocked accounts with commercial banks. Commercial banks are required to maintain a 100 percent reserve requirement against these deposits at the Bank of Guyana. There has been an accumulation of commercial arrears. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to all countries require ap- proval, which, except for tourist travel, is usually given freely, provided that no illegal capital transfer is in- volved, but there has been some accumulation of arrears. The basic annual exchange allocation for tourist travel is G$200 a person and is not cumulative. The allocation for education depends on each circumstance and is granted in terms of foreign currency needs. Resident and non- resident travelers are subject on departure to an exit tax of G$50 a person. Persons traveling abroad may take with them Guyana currency notes not exceeding G$40; these notes do not form part of any allotment of exchange for travel. The equivalent of up to G$60 may be taken out in actual currency notes as part of the foreign exchange allowance for foreign travel. Nonresident travelers may, within one month of their last entry, freely take out any foreign currency notes declared upon entry. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. Sugar may be exported only by the Guyana Sugar Corporation, and 264 bauxite and alumina, only by the Guyana Mining Enterprise Limited. Certain other exports are also chan- neled through official agencies. Most exports do not require export licenses, but transactions are supervised by the Bank of Guyana and the Customs and Excise Department to ensure that the exchange proceeds are repatriated and, if obtained in listed specified currencies (see footnote 2), surrendered. Exchange control forms have to be completed for all exports exceeding G$200 in value. A foreign exchange retention scheme permits exporters to retain a certain percentage of export pro- ceeds. The retention quotas amount to 20 percent for sugar, gold mining, fishing and shrimping sectors and vary between 15 percent and 40 percent for manufac- tured exports by the private sector. Foreign exchange thus retained can be used relatively liberally for imports of inputs and external debt servicing by exporters. Proceeds from Invisibles Specified currencies (see footnote 2) received on account of invisibles must be sold to an authorized bank, but other currencies may be retained by the recipient. Travelers may bring in freely any amount in foreign bank notes; domestic bank notes up to a value of G$40 may be brought in by returning travelers only. Capital Private investment, both foreign and domestic, is governed by the Private Investment Code of 1979. Foreign investors must apply to the Bank of Guyana for approved status for new investments at the time of investment in order to be able to repatriate capital. Such approval is normally given for direct investments in new projects that would benefit the balance of payments or the economy of Guyana; "approved status" assures that profits may be remitted, and that upon liquidation of the investment, the proceeds, including any capital incre- ments after payment of all taxes, may be repatriated in full in the currency of the original investment. There are arrears on remittance of investment proceed earnings and on principal repayments. Foreign-based companies and their subsidiaries can borrow in Guyana only with the express approval of the Bank of Guyana. The export of capital by residents is not normally permitted. Listed specified currencies (see footnote 2) obtained by residents through capital transactions must be surrendered to an authorized bank, but other curren- cies may be retained by the recipient. Emigrants of Guyanese nationality may not transfer abroad any part of their capital assets other than a settling-in allowance of G$100 for each member of a family unit; emigrants of foreign nationality may export all declared capital assets, an amount of G$24,000 a family unit at the time of emigration, and G$17,300 in each successive calendar year. Borrowing from nonresidents requires exchange con- trol approval. However, publicly owned enterprises are encouraged to borrow abroad for the financing of specific projects and in some instances for working capital ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GUYANA purposes. Since mid-1979 any borrowing by a public sector corporation is subject to prior approval by the Government Debt Committee. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Guyana for numismatic purposes, and also jewelry. With these exceptions, residents other than the monetary authori- ties, authorized dealers, producers of gold, and autho- rized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form, at home or abroad, without special permission. Neither the Bank of Guyana nor any other official institution purchases gold to supply domestic industry. Imports and exports of goM in any form by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, authorized deal- ers, producers of gold, and industrial users require licenses issued by the Ministry of Trade. Residents traveling abroad are allowed to take out with them jewelry up to a value of G$2,000, G$l ,500, and G$500, for women, men, and children under 12 years of age, respectively. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement August 19. The exchange rate for the Guyanese dollar was changed from GS$4.30 = US$1 to GS$4.15 per US$1, representing an appreciation of 3.61 percent. 265 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution HAITI (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Haiti is the Haitian Gourde, the parity of which is defined in terms of the SDR, but in such a way as to preserve the relationship of G 5 = US$1. The official buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar are G 5 = US$1. The U.S. dollar circulates freely and is generally accepted in Haiti. Sales of foreign exchange are subject to a local tax of 0.20 percent. Commercial banks quote buying and selling rates for certain other currencies, based on the buying and selling rates of the U .S. dollar in markets abroad. On December 22, 1953 Haiti notified the Fund that it formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sec- tions 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control The administration of the foreign exchange system is under the control of the Bank of the Republic of Haiti (the central bank), and exchange transactions are imple- mented by that Bank and certain commercial banks. The tax code provides for a penalty, payable to the tax authorities, equal to 20 percent of any commercial foreign exchange transaction not conducted through a bank established in Haiti. Aside from this requirement, there is no exchange control, and there are no obligations prescribing the method or currency for payments to or from nonresidents. Imports and Import Payments Importation of certain consumer goods is regulated by an order of November 3, 1982. Import licenses are required for, inter alia, certain foodstuffs, certain foot- wear, cotton textiles, paints, specified household goods, and iron rods. In principle, these products are subject to global quotas, which are distributed among importers on the basis of established market shares. In practice, however, the Ministry of Commerce applies specific quotas only when the local market is clearly perceived as being flooded by a particular imported item, threatening a complete displacement of local production. The impor- tation of used automobiles is subject to the requirement that the vehicle is at most five years old and has been owned by the importer for a minimum of two years. Imports from member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance require prior authorization by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The Minis- try's prior authorization is also required for imports from any source of specified types of footwear and of a few other items that are controlled for other than balance of payments reasons. A consular fee of 2 percent is payable on all imports in the country of origin except for materials required by certain export industries. A unified and simplified system of import tariffs came into effect 266 in May 1981. Importers pay a sales tax of 10 percent on the amount of their imports. Exports and Export Proceeds Exportable commodities require prior authorization from the Office de Promotion des Denrees Exportables. Export authorization is usually granted freely but may be withheld when domestic supplies are low. Exports of coffee are subject to a 19 percent duty for light coffee and a 24 percent duty for natural coffee. Exports of aromatic oil extracts are regulated by the Marketing Office for Aromatic Oils. A minimum of 50 percent of foreign exchange proceeds from all exports is required to be held at the commercial banks, to be used for priority imports under the supervision of the central bank. Exporters are required to negotiate documentary drafts with local commercial banks to ensure the repatriation of their export proceeds. The customs administration will refuse export approval unless such drafts are cleared by the central bank. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments for invisibles are not restricted. Residents traveling abroad must pay a tax of G 75 on tickets and must buy a G 25,000 travel insurance policy by paying a premium of G 52; diplomats and staff members of international organizations are exempt. Arrears in re- spect of debt service payments arise from time to time. Capital Capital transfers abroad are not normally permitted but imports of capital may be made freely. Foreign investment in Haiti is regulated by the decrees of March 13, 1963, October 8, 1969, and December 31, 1984, and requires prior government approval. Permis- sion is normally not granted to nonresidents for invest- ments in handicraft industries. Under a decree of April 6, 1973, private banks operating in Haiti are required to keep in the form of domestic assets a minimum of 85 percent of their liabilities to local customers. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Haiti for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. The Bank of the Republic of Haiti has the exclusive right to purchase gold domestically and to export gold in the form of coin, mineral dust, or bars. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry carried as personal effects by travelers may be made only by the Bank of the ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Republic of Haiti; exports require in addition prior authorization by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Ministry of Finance, as well as an endorsement by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry before customs clearance. However, commercial imports of articles containing a limited amount of gold, such as gold watches, are freely permitted and do not require an import license or other authorization. Several gold coins have been issued, which are legal tender but do not circulate. Changes During 1985 Administration of Control January 21. The State Tobacco Monopoly was abol- ished and the administration of the taxes formerly collected by this agency was passed on to the Internal Revenue Administration in the Ministry of Finance.

Not for Redistribution HONDURAS (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Honduras is the Honduran Lempira, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at L 2 = US$1. The official buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar are L 2.00 and L 2.02, respectively, per US$1. Bank notes in Costa Rican colones, Guatemalan quetzales, Nicaraguan cordobas, and Salvadoran colones are purchased at parity rates with a 1 percent commission and are sold at parity rates. The buying and selling rates for other currencies that are of significance to the foreign trade of Honduras are fixed daily on the basis of the buying and selling rates of the currency concerned against the U.S. dollar in foreign markets. Separate exchange rates arise from the ar- rangement permitting exporters to Central American countries to transfer their foreign exchange proceeds to importers at freely negotiated exchange rates. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. On August 19, 1950 Honduras formally notified the Fund that it had assumed the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2 , 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, beginning on July 1, 1950. Prescription of Currency There are no regulations prescribing the method of currency for payments to or from nonresidents. Pay- ments among member countries of the Central American Common Market (CACM)1 in respect of trade and invisibles are settled every six months in the domestic currency of the payer through the Central American Clearing House. If the outstanding balance is in excess of US$12 million, immediate settlement is required. Payments to and from Colombia in respect of merchan- dise trade and invisibles are settled on a six-month basis in U .S. dollars through a reciprocal credit arrangement between the member central banks of the Central American Clearing House and the Bank of the Republic of Colombia. Payments to Mexico in respect of mer- chandise trade and invisibles are settled on a four- monthly basis in U .S. dollars under a similar agreement between the member central banks of the Central American Clearing House and the Bank of Mexico. There are monthly quotas on the amount of lempira notes and coins that can be purchased by the central banks of other CACM countries,2 similar to those imposed by these countries on the purchases of their currencies by the Central Bank of Honduras. Beginning August 1983, all lempira-denominated payments amounting to at least L 1,500 processed through the Central American Clear- 1 Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. 2Costa Rica was exempt from the quota. 268 ing House in respect of trade and trade-related transac- tions with Mexico, Colombia, and member countries of the CACM require prior authorization from the Central Bank of Honduras. Imports and Import Payments Import permits are required for all items and are issued by the External Financing Department of the Central Bank. Imports are categorized according to those that must be paid for in cash (mainly nonessential imports) and those that can be financed with credit. The purpose of the classification is to discourage the import of luxury goods by denying them foreign credit and limiting their access to domestic credit by setting portfolio ceilings. A priority scheme for the approval of import permits has been established on a temporary basis, with the intention of further restraining the demand for nonessential im- ports; the scheme includes five categories with specified maximum waiting periods in each case. Importers using their own sources of foreign exchange are required to obtain prior approval from the Ministry of Economy; import permits for such importers can be obtained within five days. Imports may be checked for appropriate pricing; import prepayments are subject to certain re- strictions on the means of settlement. As a restraint on import prepayment, central bank authorization is re- quired when payments for imports by bank drafts exceed US$5,000. Imports from CACM member countries in excess of US$25,000 in each case are also subject to prior authorization by the Central Bank. Depending on the foreign exchange situation, the Foreign Exchange Department of the Central Bank may subject the alloca- tion of foreign exchange for imported goods and services to a set of policy-determined priorities.3 A 100 percent guarantee deposit is required against all requests to open sight letters of credit for import payments; the deposits are held with commercial banks .4 Importers are also required to deposit with the Central Bank the lempira equivalent of requests for official foreign exchange that are not granted within a specified waiting period. Importation of corn, rice, sorghum, beans, and pota- toes is the monopoly of the Honduran Institute of Agricultural Marketing (IHMA). 3The Central Bank is authorized to allocate foreign exchange in accordance w i th the following priorities: external financial payments, essential consumer items, health products, educational materials, fuel and lubricants, raw materials, agricultural and industrial inputs, machinery, equipment, and spare parts, and other goods and services. 4Prior to May 1982, when this practice was introduced, the requirement had already been put in operation by a number of local commercial banks whose foreign correspondents had been requiring of them an equivalent deposit of foreign currency at the time that the letter of credit was confirmed. Since local branches of foreign banks were not subject to the same requirement, the Central Bank decided to generalize the practice in order to equalize the position of all commercial banks with respect to their opportunities for financing foreign trade. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Under the provisions of the Central American Agree- ment on Fiscal Incentives, Honduras grants duty exoner- ations on imports of raw materials and capital goods to approved industrial firms. Most imports from countries outside the CACM are subject to customs du ty. Imports from the CACM are subject to customs duties ranging from zero to 35 per- cent, under a bilateral trade agreement. Some goods are subject to a customs surtax of 12 percent of the duty and to a consular charge of 8 percent of the f .o .b. value. There is a duty-free zone in Puerto Cortes. Exports and Export Proceeds Any export with a value exceeding US$1,000 requires a license and is subject to prior authorization of the External Financing Department of the Central Bank. All foreign exchange proceeds must either be surren- dered to the Central Bank or to authorized banks and institutions, or be held as dollar-denominated deposits with commercial banks. Exporters of specified goods (bananas, minerals, meat, and shrimp) are allowed to retain up to 25 percent of the foreign exchange proceeds to finance their own imports. The withdrawal of dollar- denominated deposits is subject to compliance with the procedures on the use of foreign exchange. In general, the surrender of export proceeds must be made within 90 days following the negotiation of export documents. The Central Bank is authorized to require banks to sell to it foreign exchange holdings in excess of established limits. Exports of coffee are supervised by the Honduran Coffee Institute (IHCAFE), and exports of bananas, by the Honduran Banana Corporation (CoHBANA). Exports of corn, rice, beans, and potatoes are controlled by the Honduran Institute of Agricultural Marketing ( IHMA ), and lumber exports are channeled through the Honduran Forest Development Corporation (COHDEFOR). There is an export tax on cattle, meat, and sugar, and a general export duty of 1 percent of the f .o .b. value of all other export items except bananas, coffee, cattle, meat, sugar, minerals, and nontraditional products. The export pro- motion law enables nontraditional exports to receive a reduction in payments of indirect taxes. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles are either subject to a surren- der requirement or must be held as dollar-denominated deposits with commercial banks. All purchases of foreign exchange in excess of US$5,000 require prior approval of the Central Bank. For statistical purposes, however, all buyers of foreign exchange are required to file an application stating how such funds will be used. Within this limit, persons traveling abroad may purchase foreign currency notes and coins in an amount not exceeding US$100 a person. There are no restrictions on the import of foreign bank notes by travelers. HONDURAS Capital The authorization of the Minister of Finance and approval by the Central Bank are required for all activities involving the receipt of foreign exchange resources and their transfer abroad for purposes of investment in mu tual fund s, housing developments, real estate, or similar activities. Foreign mutual funds and similar financial institutions require permission to collect funds in Honduras for deposit or investment abroad. The approval of the Ministry of Finance, the National Planning Council (CONSUPLANE), and the Central Bank is required for the public sector to contract any foreign indebtedness, whether for import financing or for other purposes. The contracting of external debt by the private sector requires approval by the Central Bank. External debt contracts must be registered with the Central Bank, which provides foreign exchange for the servicing of only duly registered and approved external debt. The contracting of external financing must conform with specified priorities. Sight and term deposits in foreign currency at the banks are subject to a reserve requirement of 30 percent; the reserve requirement for certificates of deposit of US$25,000 and above is 20 percent, and 15 percent for savings deposits in foreign currency w i th savings and loan associations. Foreign exchange hold- ings in excess of specified limits may be required to be sold by the banks to the Central Bank. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Hon- duras for num isma t ic purposes. W i th this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and autho- rized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Central Bank; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, industrial users, and producers of gold. All locally produced gold is exported in the form of ore for ref in ing. Commercial imports and exports of jewelry and other articles containing gold require licenses issued by the Ministry of Economy; for most articles, these are granted freely. Exports of gold are subject to a tax of 5 percent. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement March 19. A parallel exchange market was introduced for trade transactions with the rest of Central America. Exporters to Central American countries were allowed to retain their foreign exchange proceeds in special deposit accounts in denominated foreign currencies to be used for payments for imports originating from these coun- tries or transferred to other importers at freely negotiated exchange rates. 269 ©International Monetary Fund.

Not for Redistribution HONG KONG1 (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Hong Kong is the Hong Kong Dollar. The authorities do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions. Starting on October 17, 1983, certificates of indebtedness denominated in Hong Kong dollars and issued by the Government Exchange Fund, which the two note-issuing commercial banks are re- quired to hold as backing for their Hong Kong dollar note issues, are issued only against payment of U.S. dol- lars at a fixed exchange rate of HK$7.80 = US$1; payments by the Exchange Fund on surrender of certifi- cates of indebtedness to it when the note issue declines are also made in U.S. dollars at the same exchange rate. By arrangement, other licensed banks also pay or receive U.S. dollars at this same rate when they draw bank notes from or surrender them to the note-issuing banks. With these exceptions, the exchange rate for the Hong Kong dollar is freely determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, though influenced by the fixed rate that applies to note-issue transactions. The authori- ties do, however, retain a capability to intervene in the market. On December 31, 1985 the middle rate in the interbank foreign exchange market for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, was HK$7.8110 = US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control There is no exchange control. Import and export licensing is carried out mainly by the Director of Trade. Prescription of Currency No prescription of currency requirements are in force. Settlements between residents of Hong Kong and non- residents may be made and received freely in Hong Kong dollars or any other currency. Nonresident Accounts No distinction is made between resident and nonresi- dent accounts. Imports and Import Payments Imports are free from licensing control, except for certain dutiable commodities, items controlled for health, safety, or security reasons, and textiles that are subject to licensing control for surveillance reasons. Imports of rice are subject to a quota system operated by *Hong Kong is a nonmetropolitan territory in respect of which the United Kingdom has accepted the Fund's Articles of Agreement. the Department of Trade. With a few exceptions, a trade declaration must be lodged with the Customs and Excise Department within 14 days of importation in respect of each consignment of goods imported into or exported from Hong Kong. Payments for permitted imports may be made freely, at any time, and in any currency. Exports and Export Proceeds Export licenses are required for a small number of items to enable Hong Kong to fulfill its international obligations and for health, safety, or security reasons. Textiles are also subject to licensing control because of a number of bilateral arrangements with specified coun- tries under which the export of certain textiles is restricted. Export proceeds may be collected at any time and in any currency. They need not be repatriated or surrendered. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles There are no limitations on payments for or receipts from invisibles. Resident and nonresident travelers may freely bring in and take out any amount in domestic or foreign banknotes, travelers' checks, and other means of payment. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or payments by residents or nonresidents. A license is required before any company, whether incorporated in Hong Kong or elsewhere, can do banking business in Hong Kong. Subject to certain conditions, an overseas bank can establish a representa- tive office in Hong Kong and may also register a subsidiary as a deposit-taking company. A deposit- taking company may not, however, conduct banking business or use the word "bank" in its title. Gold There is a free market for gold in which dealings by residents and nonresidents are unrestricted. Imports and exports of gold in any form (including finished jewelry) are freely permitted and do not require licenses. Resi- dents may hold gold in any form in Hong Kong or abroad. A gold coin of HK$ 1,000 is legal tender but does not circulate. Changes During 1985 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 271 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution HUNGARY (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Hungary is the Hungarian Forint. The exchange rate of the forint against currencies other than those of the member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) ,1 Albania, and the Dem- ocratic People's Republic of Korea is derived on the basis of a weighted basket of nine currencies;2 the weights are adjusted annually and reflect the currency composition of Hungary's export receipts from the nonruble currency area. The value of the forint in terms of the basket is adjusted at irregular intervals, notably on the basis of the difference between the domestic and foreign rates of inflation. Exchange rates are quoted on a daily basis by the National Bank of Hungary for 19 convertible curren- cies,3 and the National Bank stands ready to effect transactions in any of these currencies. Buying and selling rates are set with a spread of l/io of 1 percent around the middle rate for each currency.4 Rates for other currencies are based on the quoted rate for the U .S. dollar and the dollar rates for the currencies concerned in international markets. Rates for currencies included in the basket to which the forint is pegged (within annual margins of 1 percent) are based on the day's exchange rates in major international markets. The buying and selling rates for spot transactions in U .S. dollars on December 31, 1985 were Ft 47.50 and Ft 47.39, respectively, per US$1. In the case of exchange rates for currencies of countries with which transactions are settled in transferable (or clearing) rubles, including Romania and Viet Nam, spreads in excess of 2 percent have in practice arisen between the cross exchange rate implied by the quoted rates for the transferable ruble and the explicit exchange rate agreed bilaterally between Hungary and the respective partner countries. Official forward exchange rates are quoted by the National Bank of Hungary in respect of the above- mentioned 19 convertible currencies for which exchange rates are quoted on a daily basis. Forward rates are formed by adjusting the official foreign exchange mid- 1 The member countries of the CMEA are Bulgaria, Cuba, Czecho- slovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, the U .S .S .R ., and Viet Nam. 2Aus tr ian schillings, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and U .S. dollars.

In addition to the above, exchange rates for bank notes and travelers' checks are quoted for Greek drachmas and Yugoslav dinars. 4The spread of 0.2 percent between buy ing and selling rates applies to spot telegraphic transactions. For traveler's checks and bank notes, a 6 percent spread is maintained between buy ing and selling rates. 272 point rates valid at a particular time for percentage differentials set by the Bank variously for periods of 7-30 days; 90 days; 180 days; 270 days; and 360 days. The Bank is prepared to buy (or sell) currencies forward from (or to) enterprises having foreign exchange receipts (or expenditures) arising from foreign trade. The largest portion of Hungary's trade and financial settlements with the member countries of the CMEA is settled in transferable rubles through the International Bank for Economic Cooperation (IBEC) and with Al- bania, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and the People's Republic of Kampuchea in clearing rubles. Official exchange rates for the transferable ruble and the clearing ruble are, in principle, quoted daily by the National Bank, although these rates remain fixed for longer periods. At the end of December 1985 the buying and selling rates for the forint against the transferable ruble were Ft 27.972 and Ft 28.028, respectively; the same rates applied to the clearing ruble. The National Bank also quotes rates of exchange for the forint against the currencies of member countries of the CMEA, Albania, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. These rates are used for noncommercial settlements, for exam- ple, international travel, expenses of diplomatic repre- sentation, and scholarships,5 and are based on multila- teral agreements or, in some cases, on supplemental bilateral agreements. Administration of Control The authority for enforcement of foreign exchange regulations is vested in the Minister of Finance. Related functions are exercised by the Minister through the National Bank, except for those functions reserved for the Minister himself or delegated to other institutions, such as the Hungarian Foreign Trade Bank and the Central Corporation of Banking Companies. The Na- tional Bank may entrust other agencies, such as banking institutions and travel agencies, with the performance of specified tasks. The Central European International Bank Ltd ., established jointly by the National Bank and Western European and Japanese interests, is exempt from Hungarian foreign exchange regulations and re- strictions in respect of authorized activities. Foreign trade is a state monopoly. In practice, this means that commercial exports and imports may be effected only by economic enterprises authorized for this purpose. Organizations that are not authorized to con- duct foreign trade channel their imports and exports through authorized organizations. At the end of Decem- ber 1985 there were 259 enterprises authorized to engage in foreign trade on a permanent basis, of which 38 were 5 A commission of 3 percent applies to purchases from tourists of bank notes in the currencies of member countries of the CMEA. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution specialized foreign trade organizations;6 the rest con- sisted of industrial enterprises, state farms, cooperatives, and domestic trading concerns. In addition, approvals for ad hoc foreign trade activities were granted in 950 cases during 1985. Authorization to enter into foreign trade may thus be either general or specific, referring in the latter case to the import and export activities of a producing enterprise for its own account or to a single transaction or contract. Prescription of Currency Payments to and from countries with which Hungary has multilateral and bilateral payments agreements are made in the currencies and in accordance with the procedures set forth in those agreements.7 If there are no specific agreements, or if trade takes place outside the scope of the agreements, settlement is made in a convertible currency. Nonresident Accounts Nonresident juridical and physical persons may main- tain convertible currency accounts at the National Bank, at certain designated offices of the National Savings Bank, and at the Foreign Trade Bank; only relatively large amounts may be placed at the National Bank. The accounts carry tax-free interest, payable in the currency of deposit, and have a guarantee of repayment but no exchange rate guarantee. Nonresident deposits at the National Bank earn rates of interest set on a competitive basis with those in international markets. Interest rates on nonresident deposits at the National Savings Bank at the end of December 1985 ranged from 2 percent to 15.25 percent a year, depending on the currency and the maturity of the deposit and reflecting the financial market situation. No authorization is required to open such accounts or to draw on them. Unless specifically exempted, payments in forint to nonresidents must be deposited in blocked forint ac- counts at the General Banking and Trust Company. Approval authority for withdrawals from blocked forint accounts has been delegated to the National Savings Bank for specified uses, for example, living expenses while traveling in Hungary, medical expenses, and certain personal and family-related expenses; approval may be obtained on the basis of a verbal declaration. Requests for approval for other uses must be referred to 6In addition, there were nine enterprises specializing in the represen- tation of foreign enterprises. 7 At the end of December 1985, Hungary had bilateral payments agreements with A lban ia, the People's Republic of Ch ina, Colombia, Ecuador, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and the People's Republic of Kampuchea. Hungary also had trade agreements with bilateral payments features for certain commodities w i th Af- ghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. Except for A lban ia, the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and the People's Republic of Kampuchea, settlements under bilateral agreements were in clearing U.S. dollars. Settlements w i th the People's Republic of China were in clearing Swiss francs, and w i th A lban ia, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and the People's Republic of Kampuchea, in clearing rubles. HUNGARY the National Bank. All requests for reasonable purposes are granted. In general, no interest is paid on these accounts. Residents may also open accounts at designated offices of the National Savings Bank either in foreign currencies or in forint convertible into foreign curren- cies. Foreign exchange earned from creative, inventive, or artistic activity (including the royalties of authors, composers, and performing artists), honoraria, prizes and awards, and specified fees may be deposited in these accounts. Convertible currency income or assets from these sources may be deposited in these accounts up to the extent of the first Ft 15,000 and up to 25 percent of the excess a year (in the case of inventors, up to 30 percent of the fees from foreign sales of licenses and products under licenses). No limits apply to income from these sources earned in the currencies of countries accounting in rubles. In addition, reasonable amounts of savings from per diem payments, wages and salaries derived from employment abroad, scholarships, and artistic performances may be deposited in these ac- counts. Separate accounts are kept for deposits made in convertible and CMEA currencies. No authorization is required for the use of accounts of residents in foreign currencies or in forint convertible into foreign currencies. Withdrawals of convertible currency balances can be made in any convertible or CMEA currency, in Yugoslav dinars, or in for in t. CMEA balances can only be w i thdrawn in a CMEA currency or in forint. The deposits may be used for foreign travel or to purchase foreign goods through the Consumex and the Intertourist shops or directly from abroad against payment in convertible currencies. De- posits of more than one-year maturity earn interest at rates prevailing on international markets. Residents can also hold another category of accounts called the BC foreign currency accounts. Deposits in these accounts are limited to transfers from nonresidents to residents for the purpose of financing residents' expenses while traveling abroad. Such deposits can be used in lieu of a nonresident's affidavit in applying for a visitor's travel visa (see below). Imports and Exports All imports and exports are subject to a licensing requirement. Licenses are issued by the Licensing Department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade. No further license from the foreign exchange authority is required for export or import and the performance or use of related services. Import licenses may be global or individual and, unless otherwise specified, are valid until the end of the calendar year for which they are issued. Global licenses allow the transaction to take place with any country for the goods and services specified in the license; such licenses are used primarily for bulk imports of items, such as fertilizer and steel products, which are spread over the course of the year. Individual licenses permit transactions to take place only as specified. A fee 273 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution HUNGARY equivalent to 1 percent of the forint value of licensed imports settled in convertible currency is levied. Imports are subject to import duties and a 1 percent customs fee upon customs clearance. An advance import deposit scheme introduced in 1967 remains in place but has not been activated since 1971. Separately, a forint cover requirement applies to both imports and investment financing. In the case of imports, the importer is required to deposit the forint equivalent of the value of the letter of credit in a blocked noninterest- bearing account at the National Bank when opening a letter of credit. When importing on behalf of other end- users, foreign trade organizations can obtain payment from the end-user up to a maximum of 15 days before the due date for payment by the latter. The due date for payment can relate either to the date when a letter of credit is to be opened or, for imports against documents or acceptance, to the date of payment. In the case of investment financing, a letter from the National Bank confirming that financing for the project has been secured in full is required before spending can be initiated. The related financing is frozen in a noninterest- bearing account at the time the letter is issued by the National Bank. In the case of imported capital goods, the letter must be submitted to the licensing authority before the import license is issued. Apart from the import of consumer goods settled in convertible currencies, the licensing of imports was quasi-automatic and was used essentially for the purpose of ensuring that only authorized enterprises engaged in international trade. Beginning in September 1982, im- ports of several, mainly primary products were made subject to quotas. In addition, the regime for imports settled in the convertible currencies was applied more restrictively: imports of capital goods, other imports by large and frequent importers in excess of specified quarterly limits, and all imports by other importers were subject to individual approval on the basis of the availability of foreign exchange. These restrictions were gradually lifted during the course of 1983 and 1984; by the end of 1984, the quasi-automatic licensing system in effect before September 1982 had been fully restored. Imports of consumer goods settled in convertible curren- cies are subject to a global quota, the dollar value of which is published annually in the Foreign Trade Gazette. The value of the quota for 1986 was set at US$170 million. Licenses against the quota are granted on an order-of-arrival basis, and unused allocations are not automatically added to the quota for the next year. Licenses are generally applied for by the enterprises authorized to engage in foreign trade. Settlement in foreign exchange is authorized and effected upon receipt, and according to the terms, of valid documents for settlement. Ex post verification of compliance with the terms of the license is made by the foreign exchange authority twice a year. Certain imports are prohibited for sanitary, security, and other non- economic reasons. 274 Hungary has been a member of the GATT since 1973. As part of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations (MTN), the arithmetic average tariff level applied on a most- favored-nation basis is to be reduced from 24.9 percent in 1979 to 16.1 percent in 1987. Imports from devel- oping countries enjoy preferential tariff treatment. In general, returning Hungarian travelers may import, free of customs duty, goods for noncommercial use up to a value of Ft 6,000. Returning residents may import, free of customs duty, goods up to a value equivalent to 40 percent of their earnings while stationed abroad for more than one year. Border trade is conducted on the basis of intergovernmental agreements. Certain exports are prohibited for sanitary, security, and other non- economic reasons. Indirect taxes on exports settled in convertible currencies are refunded at a rate equivalent to 7 percent of value. In addition, an export subsidy may be applied to exports of agricultural products and processed foods settled in convertible currencies, amounting to not more than 28 percent of the value of the agricultural raw material content of these exports. The tax refund and the subsidy are calculated on the basis of the customs invoice value. Most trade with member countries of the CMEA, Albania, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and the People's Republic of Kampuchea is conducted under bilateral agreements. Trade within this framework takes place at prices fixed in the annual bilateral agreements, on the basis of quotas representing delivery obligations, with determined conditions of delivery. Subsidies may be paid to compensate exporting enterprises for losses incurred if such exports are required for the fulfillment of the agreements' obligations. All foreign assets and currencies must be declared and all foreign exchange assets must be sold to the National Bank of Hungary, unless otherwise exempted. Declara- tion must be made within eight days, but the length of time allowed for repatriation depends on the nature of the case. The Foreign Trade Bank is generally exempt from the obligation to surrender its foreign exchange assets to the National Bank. The National Savings Bank and the General Banking and Trust Company are exempt from the surrender requirement in certain cases; specific exemptions for individuals are granted in respect of gifts received while traveling and used to cover living and shopping expenses while abroad, as well as for wages and salaries earned while working abroad with official permission, or from scholarships received from nonresi- dents. Receipts of foreign currency not exceeding Ft 2,000 (in bank notes only) a person are also generally exempted from the surrender requirement. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles related to merchandise trans- actions, including transportation and advertising, are freely granted. Generally, other invisible transactions ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution exceeding Ft 5,000 require general or individual authori- zation by either the Ministry of Finance or other competent authority. Foreign exchange for related pay- ments is made available automatically once the transac- tion has been authorized. Budgetary or social institutions may obtain general authorizations for transactions up to specified amounts in connection with their own activities. General authoriza- tion up to specified amounts or proportions of turnover is given to enterprises engaging in foreign economic activities for the purpose of defraying expenses other than those directly related to trade. Such authorizations relate to expenses for travel and other expenses, such as the maintenance of foreign representation and related personnel expenses. Compliance with the conditions of the general authorizations is reviewed on an ex post basis by the Ministry of Finance, the chief control administra- tion of the Ministry of Finance, and the National Bank. Permission for travel to countries outside the CMEA area is granted only upon evidence of means of support abroad. This requirement can be met in one of three ways: (1) if living expenses while abroad are covered by nonresidents, in which case an affidavit from the nonresident or the availability of sufficient funds in a resident BC account at Touring, Money Changing, Traveling and Shipping Co., Inc. (IBUSZ) is required; (2) if living expenses while abroad are covered from the resident's own funds in a convertible currency account or from a travel allowance obtained from the National Bank; or (3) if travel is with an authorized tourist group. Travelers under the first category are labeled "visitors," while travelers under the latter two categories are labeled "tourists." Permission for private travel may be obtained once a calendar year. Authorized tourist offices obtain annual foreign exchange allocations for granting allow- ances to tourist groups. Foreign exchange allowances for travel to countries outside the CMEA may be obtained from the National Bank once every third year. Individual allowances amount to Ft 5,200 a passport holder plus Ft 2,400 a child for children of less than 14 years of age traveling under a parent's passport. Small amounts may also be granted on a case-by-case basis in excess of the basic allowance for personal reasons, for example, if certain additional transport must be paid for abroad. In general, transportation expenses for "tourists" can be settled in forint for Hungarian carriers or carriers participating in a pooling agreement of which the domestic carrier is a member. Transportation expenses for tourists can be settled in forint for any other carriers using the less expensive fares when the destination of travel cannot be reached by the above-mentioned carriers. The same regulations apply to visitors when traveling by air or long-distance coach. In the case of tourists, a supple- mentary travel allowance may be obtained for travel by car to cover gasoline expenses up to a quota fixed for each country. Visitors may purchase foreign currencies up to Ft 2,200. HUNGARY For official and business travel, separate allowances are established by the Ministry of Finance for living expenses and accommodation. Limits for living ex- penses are applied strictly, while accommodation allow- ances are applied more flexibly to reflect actual rea- sonable costs. Compliance with these limits is adminis- tered by the enterprises or institutions themselves within their allocated global foreign exchange quotas and is reviewed, on an ex post basis, by the Ministry of Finance, the chief control administration of the Ministry of Finance, and the National Bank. No minimum spending or conversion requirement applies to nonresident travelers to Hungary, except in the case of visitors from Yugoslavia, who are required to convert the equivalent of Ft 760 a trip (Ft 380 for residents of the border area) when entering Hungary other than for business purposes. (Yugoslav citizens arriving with an authorized tourist group are, however, not covered by this regulation.) For travel between Hungary and Poland and between Hungary and Czecho- slovakia, travelers are required to have in their posses- sion specific minimum amounts of the currency of their country of destination. Nonresidents may take out of the country foreign exchange assets and economic assets, in addition to their personal effects, without a license from the foreign exchange authority, provided that they have filled out a "Certified Declaration on Brought-In Assets" on arrival. In addition, nonresidents may not take out of the country articles exceeding the value of Ft 3,0008 (up to Ft 1,000 an article). Within the same overall limits, nonresidents from countries with which an agreement is in force for the reciprocal exchange of currencies (CMEA members, except Cuba and Viet Nam) may take out of the country gifts up to Ft 300 a person as well as purchased articles up to 50 percent of the amount brought into Hungary under the certification of the nonresident's foreign exchange authority. However, nonresidents may take out freely articles bought in shops designated for sales in convertible currencies. Residents and nonresidents may, without a license from the foreign exchange authority, bring into or take out of the country domestic currency in an amount not exceeding Ft 400 a person, in denominations not exceeding Ft 100. Limits of Ft 50 a person (only in coins in the case of nonresidents) apply to both residents and nonresidents, not to exceed Ft 200 a month, in the case of border-zone traffic. Special exchange regulations apply to travel to CMEA countries as follows: residents visiting CMEA countries are entitled to an annual allowance of Ft 15,000. Including a portion of the travel allowance (equivalent to the above-mentioned Ft 400) that may be taken out of the country in forint and converted at the travel destination, residents traveling to CMEA countries are entitled to an annual allowance of Ft 20,000. For the remainder of 8In border traffic, the value may not exceed Ft 200 a month unless otherwise authorized under international agreement. 275 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution HUNGARY their allowances travelers must acquire travelers' checks denominated in the currency of the country of destina- tion. All conversions are effected at the rate of exchange quoted by the National Bank for the relevant currency. A 4.5 percent commission is applied at the time of conversion. By multilateral agreement, no reconversion of forint acquired by CMEA tourists into their own national currency is allowed. Tourists from the convertible currency area can reconvert up to the equivalent of US$100, provided that the reconversion is for not more than half of the amount originally converted into forint. No foreign exchange is made available for study abroad. Students' living expenses and tuition fees while abroad must be covered by scholarships or financial support from nonresident relatives. Transfers abroad by nonresident workers in Hungary, other than those em- ployed in joint ventures, are determined on the basis of agreements between domestic and foreign institutions or enterprises. Nonresident employees of joint ventures may transfer abroad up to 50 percent of their income. Twenty percent of wages earned by Hungarian private citizens working abroad must be transferred to Hungary and converted into forint. Capital All foreign borrowing, excluding foreign borrowing on the basis of intergovernmental agreements, requires the approval of the National Bank. This approval is given only in exceptional circumstances, for example, when credits on favorable terms are guaranteed by the government of the exporter or when bankers' accept- ances are provided on favorable terms. The requirements of the economy for foreign credit are met through direct foreign borrowing by the National Bank; the aim is to prevent Hungarian enterprises from circumventing the regulations of domestic credit policy by means of foreign resources. Directives for extending short-term commercial cred- its in connection with foreign trade activities have been established jointly by the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Foreign Trade, and the President of the National Bank. No license from the foreign exchange authority is required for commercial credits in com- pliance with the directives. Medium-term and long-term credits for the export of investment goods may be extended by exporting enterprises with the authorization of the Minister of Foreign Trade. Negotiable export documents are discounted by the National Bank. These credits are refinanced by the National Bank from its own resources. Foreign investment in the form of joint ventures with Hungarian enterprises may be established subject to the approval of the Minister of Finance. Joint ventures may also be established in duty-free zones. In both cases the joint venture is considered as a Hungarian legal entity, but those in duty-free zones are not subject to several regulations. Foreign participation is limited in general to 49 percent but a higher proportion may be allowed in the 276 banking and service sectors. In other sectors, foreign majority requires special permission of the Minister of Finance. Machines and equipment, technical know-how, and patents may qualify as part of foreign investment. Tax benefits may be granted by the Minister of Finance. Guarantee is given for the transfer of the foreign investors' share of profits or, in the case of liquidation of the joint venture, of the invested capital. In addition, a guarantee may be obtained from the National Bank, covering losses on invested assets as a result of state measures, or from Hungarian banking institutions, covering the fu l f i l lment of obligations of the Hungarian partner. Foreign investment by resident economic organiza- tions, either by establishing subsidiaries or affiliates or by acquiring an interest in a foreign enterprise, is subject to the approval of the head of the competent sectoral authority. In addition, approval is required from the Minister of Finance in his capacity as the foreign exchange authority. Except for gifts with a market value of up to Ft 800, the transfer of economic assets abroad by residents is subject to licensing administered by the National Bank. Gifts (movable property) from nonresidents in excess of Ft 25,000 a person are also subject to licensing. Nonresidents are not generally allowed to acquire real estate, buildings, or other immovable property in Hun- gary, except in the form of inheritance. Outward capital transfers by resident physical persons are not generally approved. For certain established categories, such as inheritances, transfers may be autho- rized on the basis of agreements and reciprocity with other countries, subject to the control of the Central Corporation of Banking Companies. Emigrants may take out of the country up to Ft 60,000 an adult and Ft 30,000 a child, silver objects weighing at most 1 kilogram, and gold and jewelry considered to be personal effects. Other assets of emigrants, as well as the assets of nonresidents, are held either in the care of a person designated by the nonresident owner or, in the case of financial assets, in a nonresident blocked forint account or blocked deposit. Gold All trade in gold and gold objects is subject to the authority of the National Bank and in concurrence with the competent authority in the case of industrial and artistic uses. All ingots and gold coins, except for one piece a person of every kind of gold coin minted prior to 1945, must be offered to the National Bank for sale. Except for transactions with enterprises specifically authorized to transact in gold, all transactions in gold are subject to licensing administered by the National Bank.

Not for Redistribution ICELAND (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Iceland is the Icelandic Kr6na, the exchange rate of which is determined on the basis of a trade-weighted basket of currencies. There is no organ- ized foreign exchange market in Iceland and official buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar, the principal trading and reserve currency, are quoted by the Central Bank of Iceland. These rates are adjusted from time to time; on December 31, 1985 the buying and selling rates were ISK 42.00 and ISK 42.12, respectively, per US$1. Rates for other currenciesl are based on the official rates for the U.S. dollar and the dollar rates for the currencies concerned in international markets. The authorized banks are permitted to carry out exchange transactions among themselves and to engage in arbitrage in foreign markets. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Iceland formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from September 19, 1983. Administration of Control The Ministry of Commerce, after consulting with the Central Bank, has the ultimate responsibility for matters concerning import and export regulations and payments for invisibles. The Central Bank is responsible for the regulation of foreign exchange transactions and of exchange control, including capital controls; it is also responsible for ensuring that all foreign exchange due to residents from commercial transactions is surrendered to authorized banks and that such foreign exchange is disposed of as authorized. Three commercial banks (the National Bank of Iceland, the Fisheries Bank of Iceland, and the Agricultural Bank of Iceland), previously the only fully authorized banks, were joined in 1984 and 1985 by private banks and the major savings banks. Prescription of Currency All exchange receipts are obtained in convertible currencies. Settlements with countries whose currencies are usually tied to the U.S. dollar, and with several other countries in Eastern and Southern Europe, as well as outside Europe, are made in U.S. dollars. Settlements with countries of the former Sterling Area and some other countries are made in sterling; and those with other countries, are made in their respective currencies. Nonresident Accounts There are two categories of nonresident krona ac- counts with the authorized banks: Foreign Accounts and 'Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Irish pounds, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. 278 Special Accounts. The opening of nonresident accounts requires individual approval. Foreign Accounts may be credited with the proceeds from the sale of foreign currency to authorized banks and with authorized payments due to nonresidents from residents. Balances on Foreign Accounts may be used freely for payments to residents and may, without a license, be converted into the currency of the country of residence of the account holder. These accounts are, in practice, seldom used, payments for international trans- actions generally being made in U.S. dollars, sterling, or other convertible currencies.2 Special Accounts in kr6nur or foreign currency may be opened by agreement with an authorized bank. The most important of these accounts are those of foreign banks and foreign insurance companies. They may be credited freely with approved payments from residents. Imports and Import Payments All goods not on the restricted list may be imported freely without an import license from any country; most imports are liberalized. The main commodities on the restricted list are petroleum products, fishing vessels, certain agricultural goods, and specified industrial brooms and brushes. Certain imports, including fertiliz- ers, tobacco, matches, and alcoholic beverages, can be ordered freely but admitted only under • state-trading arrangements. Fresh vegetables and potatoes are im- ported under the auspices of the Agricultural Production Board. For imports from all sources, when requiring a license, a fee of 1 percent is charged as a license fee on the krdna value of the import license when the license is issued. Petroleum products and fishing vessels are subject to licensing, but no fee is charged. Importers of goods not requiring licenses are not required to obtain a foreign exchange permit prior to shipment from abroad, but import documentation must be presented to one of the authorized banks to obtain foreign exchange. The goods will not be cleared by the customs unless payment has already been made, or the importer has acquired a permitted foreign credit, usually by accepting a bill of exchange issued by the seller. For imports that require an individual license, foreign ex- change is granted in accordance with the terms stipulated in the license. Importers may freely accept suppliers' credit for up to three months from the date of arrival at an Icelandic port for listed goods corresponding to around two thirds of 2 Residents who hold foreign currency that they are not required to sell to authorized dealers may open Foreign Accounts with Icelandic banks. Such accounts, denominated in Danish kroner, deutsche mark, pounds sterling, and U.S. dollars, may be credited with authorized receipts in foreign currencies and may be debited for authorized payments in foreign currencies. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution imports; the goods not listed are mainly certain building materials, household applicances, motor vehicles for pesonal use, and nonessential goods. Credit in excess of 3 months and not exceeding 12 months is permitted in respect of some categories of goods and materials, for example, in connection with the import of industrial raw materials for which the production process is lengthy. Foreign credit in excess of 12 months is subject to government authorization issued by the Ministry of Commerce. Import documentation on credit terms must be presented to one of the authorized banks prior to customs clearance. Automobiles are subject to a special import tax ranging between 7 percent and 37 percent depending on the weight of the vehicle or the engine capacity. Buses, heavy trucks, ambulances, and public service vehicles are exempt. Certain nonessential goods, whether of imported or of domestic origin, are subject to a special excise tax of 24 percent or 30 percent, ad valorem. Payments for Invisibles No exchange license is required for government pay- ments (such as interest and amortization on external loans, expenses of the foreign service, payments to inter- national organizations, payments for postal, telegraphic, and telephone services), for banking commissions, or for bank charges on foreign exchange transactions. The authorized banks effect payments freely on most transactions on the basis of bona fide documents. There is an exchange license fee of 1 percent for all payments for invisibles. The basic allocation for tourist travel is the equivalent of US$1,500 a person for each trip abroad (US$750 for each child). Applications for foreign ex- change for chartering of ships, aircraft, and major repair of same, transactions and transfers in connection with direct insurance, and insurance operations abroad are considered on their merits. Resident and nonresident travelers may take out ISK 8,000 in Icelandic bank notes and coin in all denominations. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of fisheries and agricultural products require licenses issued by the Ministry of Commerce. The ship- ping documents must be lodged with an authorized bank. Exchange receipts accruing from exports must be surren- dered within a period of 180 days from shipment. Most fish products are subject to export levies, which are returned to the fishing industry through special funds. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles of a commercial nature must be surrendered. The owners of Icelandic ships and aircraft are permitted to retain their foreign exchange receipts from freight, passenger tickets, or other charges and to use them for operating purposes and for purchases of necessities. Icelandic insurance compa- nies that reinsure abroad are permitted to retain foreign exchange earned from premiums and indemnities and to ICELAND use it to pay reinsurance premiums, claims, and other regular expenditures. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in Icelandic bank notes and coin, up to ISK 8,000 in all denominations. Capital All investments by nonresidents are subject to indi- vidual approval. Rules concerning Icelandic joint stock companies are laid down in Law No. 32/1978, which require the majority of the founders of a joint stock company to have been domiciled in Iceland for the preceding two years. No conditions are imposed with regard to Icelandic nationality of the founders; but the right of foreigners to direct or own shares in joint stock companies is governed by legal provisions that are different for the various types of economic activity. The director or directors of the branch office shall be domi- ciled in Iceland; and, as a rule, they shall be Icelandic citizens. Participation by nonresidents in fishing, power, and mining industries is limited; the case of the alumi- num plant, which is wholly owned by nonresidents, is a special exception. Nonresident-owned foreign capital entering in the form of foreign exchange must be surrendered; nonresidents may be authorized to open nonresident accounts for such funds, in which case their retransfer abroad is permitted. Residents are obliged to surrender foreign exchange accruing to them on account of capital transactions and payments. Without the approval of the Government, residents may not obtain loans abroad, including loans for financing imports, for periods exceeding one year. Applications for the contracting of financial credits and loans abroad for a period of less than one year are considered on their merits. Transfers of capital abroad by residents require indi- vidual approval. Direct investment abroad for the pur- pose of assisting the marketing of Icelandic products is normally permitted. Portfolio investment abroad by residents is subject to license. Outward transfers of inheritances, legacies, and emigrants' assets are subject to license and are allowed up to an annual ceiling. Nonresidents may acquire Icelandic securities and other assets with imported funds; the transfer abroad of the proceeds from their sale requires authorization. Securities held in Iceland by nonresidents must be registered with the Foreign Exchange Control of the Central Bank, and all transactions concerning them are subject to licensing. The import and export of securities by residents require central bank approval. Gold A commemorative gold coin with a face value of ISK 100 is legal tender but does not circulate. Resi- dents may hold and acquire gold in Iceland, subject to certain legal requirements. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Central Bank; such licenses are not 279 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ICELAND normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. Changes During 1985 Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles April 2. The maximum amount that resident and nonresident travelers could bring in and out of Iceland in Icelandic bank notes and coin was raised from ISK 3,000 to ISK 8,000, in any denomination. Exports and Export Proceeds August 1. The surrender period for export proceeds was extended to 180 days from shipment, and authoriza- tion was gnmted for the banks tQ Qpen accounts in the major foreign currencies for resident exporters of goods and services. 280 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INDIA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of India is the Indian Rupee. Exchange rates are computed from the value of the rupee, which is determined on the basis of the relationship of the rupee to a weighted basket of currencies of India's major trading partners. India maintains the relationship of the rupee to the basket of currencies within margins of 5 percent of the value adopted as the basis. Exchange rates of the rupee in terms of the pound sterling, the intervention currency, are accordingly fixed periodically by the Reserve Bank; at the end of December 1985 they were Rs 17.46 buying and Rs 17.54 selling, per £ stg. 1. Exchange rates for spot and forward purchases of deutsche mark, Japanese yen, and U .S. dollars are based on the latest available rates and trends in international markets and are announced by the Reserve Bank every day; such rates may be changed at any time, if the need arises. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the cross rate of the pound sterling with the Indian rupee. The Reserve Bank stands ready to purchase currencies of certain member countries1 of the Asian Clearing Union (ACU), deutsche mark, Japanese yen, pounds sterling, and U .S. dollars, spot and forward, and to sell spot ACU currencies and pounds sterling. The Reserve Bank permits authorized dealers and authorized money changers to fix the floor and ceiling rates for purchases and sales of U .S. dollar and pound sterling notes on the basis of a formula furnished by the Bank. The Reserve Bank fixes periodically the "notional" exchange rates for the U .S. dollar and pound sterling at which authorized dealers are required to sell to and repurchase from the Reserve Bank proceeds of deposits in Foreign Currency Nonresident Accounts. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Authorized dealers are permitted to maintain balances and positions in "permitted currencies." Permitted cur- rencies are divided into two groups: Group A, consisting of 20 listed currencies;2 and Group B, consisting of any other foreign currency that is convertible into any of the permitted currencies in fairly active markets. Authorized dealers are also permitted to maintain abroad balances and positions in ECUs. Authorized dealers are permitted to buy and sell spot any permitted currency from and to banks in any currency outside the Bilateral Group.3 Authorized dealers are also permitted to buy and sell forward any permitted currency against any other per- mitted currency. Forward purchase or sale of foreign currencies against rupees with foreign banks is pro- hibited. On December 30, 1985 market rates for tele- graphic transfers in New York were US$8.285 buying (clean) and US$8.220 selling, per Rs 100, and the Reserve Bank's rates were US$8.28 buying spot and US$8.28, US$8.27, US$8.26, US$8.24, US$8.23, and US$8.21 for buying forward (for one, two, three, four, five, and six months' delivery, respectively), per Rs 100. The Reserve Bank provides forward cover to autho- rized dealers by purchases of sterling for delivery on any day during the first month, second month, etc., up to 9 months' delivery initially (and extendable up to 12 months), for purchases of U .S. dollars up to 12 months, and of deutsche mark and Japanese yen for delivery on any day during the first month, second month, and so on, up to the sixth month. In addition, the Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd. (ECGC) provides protection against exchange fluctua- tion from the date of a bid up to 15 years after the award of contract; exchange cover is offered in French francs, deutsche mark, Japanese yen, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, U .S. dollars, and U .A .E. dirhams. The Reserve Bank also purchases the currencies of the ACU member countries listed in footnote 1 from authorized dealers for delivery of up to six months on a monthly option basis. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Reserve Bank in accordance with the general policy laid down by the Government, in consultation with the Bank. Much of the routine work of exchange control is delegated to certain commercial banks, which act as authorized dealers. All proposals for direct investments in India, with or without equity participation, are reviewed by the Foreign Invest- ment Board. Under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, the general or specific approval of the Reserve Bank is necessary for the continuance of commercial, indus- trial, and trading activities in India of companies incorporated abroad, or with more than 40 percent nonresident interest, or for the establishment by them in India of any branch, office, or other place of business for carrying out any such activity.

Prescription of Currency For prescription of currency purposes, countries are divided into two groups: the Bilateral Group of countries (see footnote 3), and the External Group of countries (all other countries). Payments to and from the Bilateral Group of countries must be settled in Indian rupees through the appropriate clearing account. Payments to the External Group of countries may be made in rupees 281 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INDIA to the account of a resident of any country in the group or in any permitted currency.4 Receipts from the External Group of countries may be obtained in rupees from the account of a bank situated in any country in the group or in any permitted currency. However, special rules may be applicable in respect of exports under lines of credit extended by the Government of India to the governments of certain foreign countries. In addition, all payments on account of current international transactions (other than travel, export and import transactions involving set- tlement on deferred payment terms, and imports into Bangladesh under the wage earners' scheme) between India and other members of the ACU (see footnote 1), except Nepal, are required to be settled through the ACU arrangement. Nonresident Accounts The accounts of Indians and of Bhutanese and Nepal- ese nationals resident in Bhutan and Nepal, as well as the accounts of offices and branches of Indian, Bhutanese, and Nepalese firms, companies, or other organizations in Bhutan and Nepal, are treated as resident accounts.5 Accounts related to all other foreign countries are treated as nonresident accounts. The treatment of these accounts distinguishes between banks and others. The accounts of banks are classified in two groups corresponding to the division of countries for prescrip- tion of currency purposes, that is, the accounts of banks in the Bilateral Group of countries and the accounts of banks in the External Group of countries. Accounts of banks in the External Group of countries may be credited with payments for imports, interest, dividends, and other authorized purposes; with authorized transfers from the nonresident accounts of persons and firms (including banks), provided that both the transferor and the trans- feree accounts are of the same country or countries in the External Group; and with proceeds from sales of per- mitted currencies. They may be debited for payments for exports and for other payments to residents of India. These accounts may also be debited for transfers to nonresident accounts of persons and firms (including banks) and transfers to Nonresident (External) Accounts, 4All remittances by nationals of the People's Republic of China to any country outside India and all remittances to the People's Republic of China by any person resident in India, whether for personal or trade purposes, were stopped with effect from November 3, 1962. Since the resumption of trade between India and the People's Republic of China, remittances arising out of trade transactions are permitted in conformity with exchange control regulations. All nontrade-related transactions w i th the People's Republic of China or nationals of the People's Republic of China continue to be prohibited, unless generally or specifically authorized. Authorized dealers are permitted to open rupee accounts on their books in the names of their branches or correspon- dents in the People's Republic of China or Pakistan without prior reference to the Reserve Bank, but should seek direction before opening such accounts in the names of branches of Pakistani or Chinese banks operating outside Pakistan and the People's Republic of China, respectively. Authorized dealers may effect remittances to Pakistan on behalf of private importers as in the case of imports from other countries; they also may effect certain types of personal remittances in accordance with regulations applicable to such remittances; remittances for other purposes require the prior approval of the Reserve Bank. 5However, residents of Nepal obtain their foreign exchange require- ments from the Nepal Rastra Bank. 282 provided that both the transferor and transferee accounts are of the same country or of countries in the External Group. The balances in the accounts of banks in countries in the External Group may be converted into any permitted currency. All other entries on bank accounts require the prior approval of the Reserve Bank. Ordinary nonresident accounts of individuals or firms may be credited, without prior approval, for payment of dividends and interest on securities, shares, and deposits; refunds of amounts previously debited or overcharged; proceeds of remittances in appropriate foreign currency or transfers from appropriate nonresident banks' rupee accounts (see section on Prescription of Currency, above); proceeds of foreign exchange tendered by the account holder during a temporary visit to India; pro- ceeds from checks issued by the Life Insurance Corpora- tion in respect of maturity or death claims and the surrender value of policies held by nonresidents, pro- vided that the Corporation certifies that premiums had been received in India in an approved manner and that actuarial reserves were held in India; all legitimate dues accruing in India to the account holder, such as pensions, provident funds, gratuities, bonuses from a former employer, income tax refunds, etc.; and proceeds of checks, provided that the aggregate of such credits during a month does not exceed Rs 2,000 and no individual credit is in excess of Rs 750. When the nonresident account holder is an Indian national or a person of Indian origin, credits on account of withdraw- als or loans from, and maturity proceeds of investments in, the Public Provident Fund Scheme, 1968, rentals from and sale proceeds of real estate owned by the account holder, and maturity proceeds of all types of securities, as well as proceeds from the sale of securities sold on stock exchanges in India and the repurchase price of units issued by the Un it Trust of India are freely allowed. Indian emigrants may maintain ordinary non- resident accounts, as may overseas corporate bodies or trusts in which at least 60 percent ownership or beneficial interest is held directly or indirectly but ultimately by nonresident Indians, and provided that the initial deposit for opening such an account by these bodies or trusts is made from remittances abroad or from funds in India otherwise eligible for credit to these accounts. When the account holder is a foreign national of Indian origin, authorized dealers may credit the sale and maturity proceeds of all types of securities and the repurchase price of un i ts, provided that the securities were originally purchased either with funds held in the account or by remittance from abroad, and in the case of sale proceeds, that the sale was made on a stock exchange. Proceeds from the sale of shares owned by the nonresident account holder, whether he is an Indian national or a foreign national of Indian origin, may be freely credited to his account if the shares were sold with the approval of the Reserve Bank. The special regulations covering funds lodged in National Defense Remittance Scheme Special Accounts were abolished in April 1979, and such accounts are now treated as ordinary nonresident ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution accounts. Authorized dealers may debit the ordinary rupee accounts of nonresidents for (1) local disburse- ments other than for payments toward investments in India and booking of international passages (but transac- tions amounting to Rs 10,000 or more must be reported to the Reserve Bank on an ex post basis), and (2) payments toward investments in Unit Trust of India, National Plan or Savings Certificates, and Securities of the Central or State Government. Nonresident (External) Accounts may be opened by authorized dealers in India for persons of Indian nation- ality or origin resident outside India or for overseas companies and partnership firms of which at least 60 percent is owned by nonresidents of Indian nationality or origin. In addition to authorized dealers holding licenses under the 1973 Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, all state cooperative banks and those urban coopera- tive banks having a minimum working capital of Rs 100 million each and an "A" audit rating conferred by the Registrars of Cooperative Societies for at least two years are eligible to apply for authorization to maintain nonresident rupee accounts. Such accounts may also be opened for eligible persons during temporary visits to India against the tender of foreign currency travelers' checks, notes, or coin. They may be credited with new funds remitted through banking channels from the country of residence of the account holder or from any country in the External Group. They may also be credited with the proceeds of foreign currency travelers' checks, personal checks, and drafts in the name of the account holder, as well as foreign currency notes and coin tendered by the account holder during his stay in India, and also with income on authorized investments. The transfer of funds from other Nonresident (External) Accounts or Foreign Currency (Nonresident) Accounts of the same account holder is also allowed. The accounts may be debited for disbursements in India and for transfers abroad. Debits on account for investment in government securities and units of the Unit Trust of India and transfers to other Nonresident (External) Accounts of the same account holder are freely allowed. Balances can also be used for purchases of foreign currency or rupee travelers' checks or travelers' letters of credit for the use of the account holder, his fam i ly and dependents, and its directors and employees in the case of corporate entities; but transfers of funds from an individual account to a similar account of another person are ordinarily not permissible. Investments in the shares of Indian compa- nies or in partnership firms, etc., or in immovable property can be made with the specific approval of the Reserve Bank. Interest on deposits in such accounts is exempt from income tax and is transferable. The balances held in such accounts are exempt from wealth tax. Foreign Currency (Nonresident) Accounts denomi- nated in pounds sterling or U .S. dollars may be held in the form of term deposits by persons of Indian national- ity or origin who are resident in the External Group of countries and by overseas companies specified above. INDIA These accounts may be credited with amounts received through normal banking channels, including interest, which is free of income tax and wealth tax. Balances may be repatriated at any time in the currency of denomination, without reference to the Reserve Bank. Balances can also be used for the purposes for which debits to Nonresident (External) Accounts are allowed. Imports and Import Payments The Imports and Exports (Control) Act of 1947 empowers the Central Government to prohibit, restrict, or otherwise control imports. Under this Act, the Imports (Control) Order, 1955 was issued, which specified items subject to controls. All imports require import licenses or a customs clearance permit unless otherwise exempted.6 Imports of gold, silver, currency notes, bank notes, and coins are controlled by the Reserve Bank of India. Imports from Namibia (South West Africa) and South Africa are prohibited. There are two types of actual user licenses: General Currency Area Licenses and Specific Licenses (used for imports from specified countries). There is a further classification of licenses as follows: Supplementary Licenses, Import Replenishment (REP) Licenses, Capital Goods Licenses, Advance Licenses, Import/Export Passbook Licenses, Imprest Licenses, and Additional Licenses. Licenses issued for capital goods are valid for 2 years and all other licenses mentioned above are valid for 18 months. The Import Policy for fiscal years 1985/88, which came into effect on April 12, 1985, with its subsequent amendments, contains the policy governing imports. The import policy divides products into three basic cate- gories: consumption goods; raw materials, components, consumables, tools and spare parts; and capital goods. Imports of consumption goods are prohibited except for certain essential products that are canalized and items that can be imported under the personal baggage scheme by Indians returning from abroad.7 Imports of raw materials, components, and spare parts for industry are classified into three categories: (1) limited permissible, (2) restricted (nonpermissible), and (3) canalized. There is also a list of instruments which are permissible for imports against licenses. All items not included on these lists are freely available under Open General License (OGL). Nonresident Indians returning home for perma- nent settlement may, during the first 12 months after their return, import all raw materials except restricted (nonpermissible) items and canalized items under OGL, subject to a value limit for the purpose of setting up small industries. Supplementary licenses may be obtained in case of need, even for the import of limited permissible items. All licenses to industry are issued against free foreign exchange. 6The exempted category includes government imports under Open General License, relief supplies, and passenger baggage. 7 Items that can be imported under the personal baggage scheme include air-conditioner un i ts, refrigerators, deep freezers, cooking ranges, washing machines, television sets, tape recorder sets, record playing sets, movie cameras and projectors, video cassettes, textile fabrics, cigarettes, cigars, and tobacco. 283 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INDIA Special procedures apply to imports of capital goods. Specified capital goods are restricted, while other listed goods and capital goods required by returning Indians to set up small-scale industries may be imported under OGL, subject to certain conditions. For other capital goods, licenses are granted subject to prescribed proce- dure. In general, licenses are granted after it has been certified that such imports are essential (essentiality certificate), unavailable from domestic sources (indige- nous angle clearance), and, where the value of imports exceeds Rs 2 million, that the importer has advertised his requirements for a period of 45 days. However, imports of capital goods and technology are approved by the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports under a "one- window clearance procedure," provided that such im- ports reduce costs by at least 10 percent and that the importer exports at least 25 percent of his ou tpu t. For 13 industries and projects, capital goods may be imported on the basis of global tenders, irrespective of whether or not the goods are manufactured in India. However, importers are required to study domestic availability of suitable equipment before calling for tenders. The selection of suppliers on the basis of global tender is subject to scrutiny by a committee headed by the Department of Heavy Industry. For imports of capital equipment for power generation transmission and distri- bution, applicants must obtain prior clearance from the latter committee before calling for global tenders. Sub- ject to specified conditions and relative value restriction, exporters are entitled to import capital goods against their own and acquired Import Replenishment Scheme (REP) licenses without an essentiality certificate and without indigenous angle clearance. Nonresident Indians returning home for permanent settlement may import capital goods other than restricted items and certain specified items, subject to a maximum of Rs 3.5 million, for the purpose of setting up or investing in an enterprise. Under the REP, licenses are issued to merchant exporters, manufacturer-exporters, export houses, and trading houses, and are freely transferable except for cases where licenses are issued with actual user condi- tions. Exporters are able to obtain Advance Licenses (under the Duty Exemption Scheme) or Import Licenses or Import/Export Passbook Licenses to import inpu ts required for export products. The imports under the Duty Exemption Scheme and the Import/Export Passbook Scheme are duty free. The value of such licenses is debited against the REP entitlement. Registered export- ers are permitted to obtain REP licenses against export of specified products up to a certain proportion of the value of exports; these licenses are valid for importation of certain limited permissible and canalized items necessary for the production of the particular export product. The REP license entitlement is increased by 10 percent for exports that are shipped in Indian vessels. Subject to a value limit on individual items, manufacturer-exporters, export houses, and trading houses exporting select 284 products of their own manufacture are allowed to import limited permissible items and canalized items. Where the REP rate is 20 percent or less, import of limited permissible items is available up to 30 percent of the face value of the REP licenses, with a single item limit of Rs 0.15 million. Where the REP rate is more than 20 percent, the import of limited permissible items is allowed up to 25 percent, with a single item limit of Rs 0.1 million. In cases where the REP rate is more than 20 percent and an exporter has exported 50 percent or more of his output of select products, w i th a m in imum value of Rs 1.5 million, import of limited permissible items is allowed up to 25 percent, with a single item value limit up to Rs .40 million. Similarly, where the REP rate is 20 percent or more, the import of canalized items is allowed up to 20 percent, subject to a max imum of Rs 0.1 million per item; the l im it is 25 percent when the REP rate is 20 percent or less. The percentage of admissibility and restriction of the single item value is higher in cases where the export of select products is 25 percent or more of the ou tpu t. Manufacturer- exporters who have been in production during the preceding three years and have exported 100 percent of their production of select products during the preceding one year are allowed to import any item in the limited permissible list and in the list of canalized items on Acquired Licenses, up to the value of REP licenses issued in favor of the manufacturer-exporter. The items allowed for import are those that are related to the select products being manufactured and exported or select products proposed to be manufactured. Additional REP licenses based on net foreign exchange earnings are also available for trading houses and export houses. Trading houses receive additional licenses at a higher rate if they form longer-term relationships with associate manufac- turers. Small-scale units are given especially liberal treatment in respect of import licenses, and consortia of small-scale industries may form export houses. Nonin- dustrial actual users, such as research and development laboratories, scientific or higher educational institutions, and hospitals, are eligible to import their requirements of technical and professional equipment, raw materials, components, spare parts, or other items (but not office machines and consumer goods) under OGL. When a valid import license is he ld, the required exchange is released by an authorized bank on presenta- tion of the exchange control copy of the license and the shipping documents. License holders may make pay- ments by opening letters of credit or by remitting against sight drafts. Use of suppliers' credit and other long-term import credit is subject to prior approval. Advance remittances before shipping documents can be submitted are not normally allowed, but in special cases, for example, imports of machinery and capital goods for which deposits have to be made with overseas manufac- turers, the Reserve Bank grants special authorization for advance payment for a part of the value of the import. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution The import of certain commodities, including food- grains, certain oils and fats, a number of pharmaceutical products, natural rubber, raw cotton, raw ju te, cement, cashew nu ts, most fertilizers, most nonferrous metals, and certain categories of steel, is reserved for the Government or state-trading enterprises (i.e., canalized), the most important of which are the State Trading Corporation (STC), the Jute Corporation of India, the Food Corporation of India, the Steel Authority of India, Ltd. (SAIL), and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation. Bulk imports of certain raw materials that are not reserved for the public sector may also be arranged by state agencies, under the Industrial Raw Materials Assistance Center (IRMAC) facility. In addition to any applicable import du ty, imports are subject to an auxiliary duty of up to 35 percent ad valorem. Among the exemptions are foodgrains, raw cotton, and books. Payments for Invisibles In general, payments abroad for invisibles require approval. Foreign exchange is granted freely for a few such payments, mainly for expenses incidental to trade transactions and transfers of recurring contractual obligations. Premiums on insurance policies issued in foreign currency to foreign nationals not permanently resident in India are to be paid only in foreign currency; payment in rupees may be made only on annuities issued against payment from recognized superannuation or pension funds; Indian residents are prohibited from taking out life insurance policies in foreign currencies. Branches of foreign banks are not allowed to transfer abroad any profits arising from the sale of nonbanking assets. Profit remittances by branches of foreign firms, companies, and banks require the prior approval of the Reserve Bank. Remittances of dividends by Indian companies to their nonresident shareholders do not require prior Reserve Bank approval, provided that certain conditions are met. Otherwise, there are no restrictions on the remittance of profits, dividends, and interest to beneficiaries permanently resident outside India, provided that all current tax and other liabilities in India have been cleared. However, remittances of pensions and dividends and interest on shares, securities, and deposits to Indian nationals who were granted exchange facilities for emigration on or after January 1, 1963 but before April 30, 1968 are subject to an overall l im it of Rs 20,000 a year. For emigrants granted lump- sum exchange facilities after April 30, 1968 on grounds of hardship, no remittance of income is allowed. Foreign nationals temporarily resident in India on account of their business, profession, or employment are permitted to make reasonable remittances to their own countries to pay insurance premiums, for the support of their families, and for other expenses. Authorized dealers may allow such remittances by foreign nationals, other than nationals of the People's Republic of China, Pakistan, and South Africa, to the extent of 50 percent INDIA of net income. Requests for the remittance of larger amounts are considered on their merits by the Reserve Bank. Under the Foreign Travel Scheme (FTS) of 1970, residents are permitted to travel abroad without "P" form formalities to all destinations, provided they have not traveled abroad under this scheme since the beginning of the previous calendar year. For determination of eligibil- ity, all foreign travel other than under the FTS is disregarded. A visit under the FTS can be combined with visits for any other purpose except tours for export promotion and other business matters, hajj pilgrimage, and travel under the Neighborhood Travel Scheme (NTS). Under the FTS, residents are entitled to foreign exchange up to US$500 or its equivalent and a round-trip ticket, irrespective of the carrier by which they travel. Authorized travel agents, airlines, and steamship compa- nies may book passages under the FTS for any person after satisfying themselves about the intending traveler's eligibility; foreign exchange for such persons may be released by any authorized dealer after similar verification. Travel to Bangladesh, Burma, Malaysia, Maldives, Mauritius, Pakistan, Seychelles, and Sri Lanka is gov- erned by the NTS, under which residents of India visiting neighboring countries are eligible for an ex- change allowance of US$250 a person every two calendar years; this arrangement cannot be combined with the existing Foreign Travel Scheme. Authorized travel agents, airlines, and steamship companies may also book passages for persons going abroad with or w i thout an allocation of foreign exchange (other than under the above schemes), subject only to completion of a "P" form in cases where the passage fare is paid in rupees in India. Certain categories of passen- gers, including persons traveling between India and Nepal by Indian and Nepalese airlines, deck-class passengers, and employees of airlines and steamship companies traveling abroad on business for their com- pany in one of its carriers are not required to complete a "P" form. Fares for nonresidents' journeys to and from India may be settled, without Reserve Bank approval, in rupees debited to Nonresident (External) Accounts. The export of Indian currency notes and coin, except to Nepal, is in general prohibited. The export to Nepal of Indian currency notes in denominations of Rs 100 or higher is also prohibited. However, deck-class passen- gers to Burma, Malaysia, Singapore, ports in certain Middle Eastern countries, and East Afr ica, and passen- gers to Bangladesh, Pakistan, or Sri Lanka, may take with them Rs 20 a person at any one time in Indian notes and coin. Exchange bureaus and authorized money changers are permitted to sell foreign currency notes and coin up to the equivalent of Rs 100 to travelers proceeding to Bangladesh and up to US$20 or its equivalent to those proceeding to other countries except Bhutan and Nepal. Nonresidents may take out the foreign currency that they brought in (and declared on entry if it exceeded US$1,000), less the amounts sold to 285 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INDIA authorized dealers and authorized money changers in India. Unspent rupee amounts may be reconverted into foreign currency and taken out. There is a foreign exchange allowance of up to US$750 a person for settling in and for purchase of initial equipment by students going to foreign universities with fu ll bursaries. A foreign travel tax at a rate of Rs 100 a passenger is levied on all passengers embarking on an international journey to any destination other than Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burma, Maldives, Nepal, Paki- stan, or Sri Lanka. Passengers to these destinations are required to pay tax at a rate of Rs 50 a passenger. Exports and Export Proceeds Export licenses are required for some items, and most commodities may be exported without a license. In respect of controlled commodities,8 no item can be exported unless it is covered by a valid license issued by the concerned licensing authority. Exports to Namibia (South West Africa) and South Africa are prohibited. Border trade ( i .e ., frontier trade) between India and the Tibet region of the People's Republic of China is not allowed. Exchange control is exercised over the proceeds of exports to countries other than Bhutan and Nepal. An exporter must declare that the full export proceeds will be received and dealt with in accordance with the prescription of currency regulations. Foreign exchange holdings, including the proceeds of exports, must be offered for sale against rupees to an authorized dealer, unless the holder has been authorized by the Reserve Bank to retain them, or he is a foreign national or a foreign person of Indian origin, or he (or his foreign-born wife) is not permanently resident in India, and the funds do not represent the proceeds of an export. Export proceeds must be surrendered within six months of shipment. Exporters are required to obtain permission from the Reserve Bank of India through authorized dealers in the event of nonrealization of export value within the prescribed period. The Reserve Bank of India also administers a scheme under which export of engineering goods (capital goods and consumer dur- ables) is allowed under deferred credit arrangements, permitting realization of export value in installments over a period exceeding six months. Some exports are prohibited,9 and others, including coffee, groundnuts, nonmanufactured tobacco, raw cot- ton, raw wool, and oil cakes are subject to export duties. Some others, including footwear, roasted and salted peanuts, man-made fibers, live sheep and goats, are subject to m in imum prices. A substantial number of exports, mainly new manufactures such as engineering 8The export of certain commodities, including sugar, raw ju te, and several categories of steel, is reserved for the state-trading enterprises. 9Exports that are prohibited include rock crystal, quartz, silk waste, some varieties of plants and derivatives, all varieties of forestry foundation and breeder seeds, tallow fat and/or oil of any animal origin, rough (uncut and unset) precious stones, sugar cane, Khandsari sugar, pa lmy ra sugar candy, jaggery, specified animal skins, and human skeletons. 286 goods, receive cash compensatory support, import duty drawbacks, refund of central excise duty, and exemp- tions. The Import Replenishment Scheme provides for imports of specified products against exports of certain products. Bona fide foreign tourists can, with the approval of the customs, take out of India articles purchased with foreign exchange or with rupees acquired against foreign exchange, without a value limit; silver- ware of up to Rs 200 a person may also be exported on the same basis, subject to a limit of Rs 400 a family. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles must be surrendered. There are schemes for the priority allotment of cars, scooters, and tractors against certain inward remittances of foreign exchange. The import of Indian currency notes and coin is, in general, prohibited. However, deck-class passen- gers from Burma, Malaysia, Singapore, ports in certain Middle Eastern countries, and East Afr ica, and travelers from Pakistan and Sri Lanka may import into India Rs 20 a person against presentation of evidence that they previously had exported this amount from India. Travel- ers from Burma, other than deck-class passengers, may bring in Indian currency notes up to Rs 50 an adult and Rs 25 a child between the ages of 12 and 18 years. Travelers from Nepal may bring in up to Rs 75 a person. Foreign currency notes may be brought into India without limit, provided that the total amount brought in is declared to the customs authorities upon arrival if the value of foreign notes, coin, and travelers' checks exceeds US$1,000 or its equivalent. Foreign currency notes may be sold to any authorized dealer in foreign exchange or to any authorized money changer. Capital There are no restrictions on receipt of inward remit- tances from any country through authorized dealers in India; subsequent utilization of such funds in India is, however, subject to approval in most cases. Foreign investments, once admitted, are eligible for the same treatment that Indian enterprises receive. Banks in India may borrow freely from their branches and correspondents abroad, provided that borrowings in excess of Rs 2 million are utilized for the purchase of rupees from the Reserve Bank or in the interbank market to finance their normal business operations in India; repayment of such borrowings requires the prior appro- val of the Reserve Bank and may be effected only when the debtor bank has no outstanding borrowings in India from the Reserve Bank or any other bank. Foreign borrowing by nonbank Indian companies is subject to Reserve Bank approval; permission is granted for any loan that has not been obtained as an official or officially guaranteed credit by the Central Government on the basis of merits. Reserve Bank permission is required for initiating, expanding, or continuing in India any business activity or holding or acquiring shares of any company carrying on a trading, commercial, or industrial activity in India, ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution by nonresidents, noncitizens, nonbank companies not incorporated under Indian law, and Indian companies with over 40 percent nonresident interest.10 Foreign investment is governed by the Foreign Exchange Regula- tion Act (FERA) of 1973. The Reserve Bank will allow companies having nonresident interest in excess of 40 percent and up to 74 percent to continue their activities depending on the extent to which the company is engaged in "core" industry or export-oriented produc- tion, or in manufacturing activities that require sophis- ticated technology. Foreign companies can retain a 51 percent nonresident equity as long as their combined core sector production, application of sophisticated technology, and export production account for not less than 60 percent of their annual turnover, with a minimum of 10 percent of exports out of their total annual turnover within a period not exceeding two years from the date of approval by the Reserve Bank. If their combined core sector production, application of sophis- ticated technology, and export production account for not less than 75 percent of their annual turnover, foreign companies can retain 74 percent nonresident ownership. Companies with exports exceeding 40 percent of the total ex-factory cost of annual production are allowed to operate with 51 percent nonresident equity, and those with export performance exceeding 60 percent of total ex-factory cost of annual production are eligible to retain foreign equity up to 74 percent. Companies that export 100 percent of production may be wholly owned by nonresidents. Companies engaged predominantly in trading activities, or not meeting the other criteria listed 10Persons of Indian nationality or origin who are resident abroad and overseas companies and partnership firms that are owned at least 60 percent by nonresident Indians may invest freely in any public or private limited company, in any partnership or proprietorship concern, and in industrial, manufacturing, or trade activity (except where the proposed investment is in real estate), provided that the funds required are either remitted from abroad through normal banking channels or are drawn from their Nonresident Accounts, provided that an undertaking is given that repatriation of the capital invested or the profits and dividends arising therefrom will not be requested, and provided that overall limits on holdings of shares and convertible debentures bought through the stock exchange by nonresident Indians (see below) are adhered to. Nonresident Indians and overseas companies defined above can use funds derived from fresh remittances or held in their Nonresident (External) or Foreign Currency (Nonresident) Accounts to (1) make portfolio investment, with repatriation benefit, up to 1 percent of the capital, provided that their holdings of shares and convertible debentures held on either a repatriable or nonrepatriable basis do not exceed (a) 5 percent of the paid-up capital of the company concerned, or (b) 5 percent of the total paid-up value of each series of debentures issued by the company concerned; (2) invest freely in National Savings Certificates with fu ll repatriation benefit; and (3) invest up to 40 percent of the new equity capital issued by a company (other than a FERA company) setting up industrial manufacturing projects and up to 74 per- cent of new investments, including expansion of existing industrial undertakings in specified priority industries, with free repatriation of such investment and income therefrom after deduction of applicable Indian taxes. Such investments with repatriation benefits can also be made in hospitals and three-, four-, or five-star hotels. Nonresident Indians and overseas companies, as defined above, can also place funds with public limited companies in India as deposits, with fu ll repatria- tion benefits, provided (1) the deposits are made for a period of three years; (2) the deposits are made in conformity with the prevailing rules and within the limits prescribed for acceptance of deposits by such companies; and (3) the funds are made available by the depositors by remittance from abroad or by payment from their Nonresident (External) or Foreign Currency (Nonresident) Accounts. Special tax concessions are applicable to investments by nonresident Indians. INDIA above, have been required to reduce their foreign shareholding to 40 percent within a specified period, or change their activities to meet the above criteria. Branches of foreign companies other than airlines, shipping companies, and liaison offices must in all cases become Indian companies. All companies are subject to "dilution" formulas, as follows: companies with foreign direct holdings exceed- ing 75 percent must raise 40 percent of the estimated cost of expansion through additional equity capital issued to Indians; for companies with foreign holdings above 60 percent but below 75 percent and above 51 percent but below 60 percent, the corresponding equity is permitted in companies engaged predominantly in inter- nal trading and commercial activities. Without the permission of the Reserve Bank, residents are prohibited from lending to, or depositing money with, a nonbank firm or company in which the nonresident interest is more than 40 percent. Noncitizens, non-Indian compa- nies, and nonbank Indian firms with more than 40 percent foreign participation must obtain Reserve Bank permission in order to acquire, hold, transfer, or dispose of immovable property within India (except when a lease for a period of not more than five years is involved). The prior approval of the Reserve Bank is also required for all transfers of shares of Indian companies by nonresidents or foreign nationals to other persons, whether resident or nonresident. However, the sale and transfer of shares of Indian companies through stock exchanges in India by nonresidents of Indian nationality or origin in favor of citizens of India or persons of Indian origin do not require the Reserve Bank's clearance, where the proceeds of such shares sold by the transferor are credited to his ordinary nonresident rupee account with a bank authorized to deal in foreign exchange in India, without a right of repatriation outside India. Residents are prohibited, except with Reserve Bank permission, from engaging in any transaction that in- creases beyond 49 percent the nonresident share of a business outside India in which the nonresident interest is 49 percent or less, and they are also prohibited, except with Reserve Bank permission, from holding, acquiring, transferring, or disposing of immovable property outside India (except where a lease of not more than five years is involved). Residents also require Reserve Bank approval to transfer any interest in a business in India to a nonresident, a noncitizen, a nonbank company not incorporated under Indian law, or an Indian company with over 40 percent foreign participation. Furthermore, Reserve Bank approval is required for residents export- ing Indian securities and transferring Indian securities to nonresidents. Residents are prohibited—except with central government or Reserve Bank permission—from guaranteeing the obligation of a nonresident or the obligation of a resident in favor of a nonresident, and are also prohibited, except with central government permis- sion, from associating with or participating in any business concern outside India. 287 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INDIA Capital invested in approved projects after January 1, 1950 by residents of other countries, including capital appreciation on the original investment, may be repatri- ated at any time. However, Reserve Bank approval must be obtained before effecting a sale that involves repatria- tion of assets. The proceeds of approved sales are allowed to be remitted in suitable annual install- ments, not exceeding four. The proceeds from liquidated foreign investments not eligible for repatriation are kept in a nonresident account. Indian nationals are not normally granted any foreign exchange facilities for emigration purposes. In cases of exceptional hardship, foreign exchange may be released up to the equivalent of Rs 100,000 in one lump sum at the time of emigration; the remainder of the emigrant's assets and income is kept in a nonresident account, and no further remittances, including pensions, if any, are allowed. Foreign nationals who are temporarily resident in India (other than nationals of the People's Republic of China, Pakistan, and South Africa) are permitted at the time of their retirement to transfer to their own countries the proceeds from the sale of their investments, subject to a limit of Rs 100,000 for each family at the time of retirement and the remainder in annual installments not exceeding Rs 50,000; in addition, they may transfer all their current remittable assets in India. There are no restrictions on the import into India of Indian or foreign securities. The acquisition, sale, transfer, export, or other disposal of foreign securities requires approval. Residents (other than foreign nation- als temporarily but not permanently resident in India and their foreign-born wives also not permanently resident in India) who are private persons are not normally per- mitted to purchase securities or personal real estate outside India. Indian nationals, and persons of Indian origin holding foreign passports, resident abroad and wishing to return to India to take up employment or to set up small industrial units are, upon application, exempted for a period of five years from the date of their return to India from the requirement that any foreign currency balances in their possession be surrendered within three months of arrivaL As an alternative to holding such balances in the form of foreign currency, the holder may use the funds for the import of machinery, raw materials, and compo- nents, subject to an import license, or, in small amounts, for personal requirements. Furthermore, they have the option of surrendering their balances immediately, with the right to reacquire them within five years should they decide to return to a foreign country. Balances held in Nonresident (External) Accounts or Foreign Currency (Nonresident) Accounts in India by such persons on the date of their return to India are also eligible for similar retransfer or reconversion facilities. These various facili- ties are not available in respect of earnings arising from employment abroad with any Indian-owned organiza- tion. Foreign nationals in India not permanently residing there are permitted to maintain foreign currency ac- counts; this permission is also extended to foreign 288 nationals of Indian origin who have come to India for employment of a specified duration or for an assignment not exceeding three years. Under the Returning Indians Foreign Exchange Enti- tlement Scheme, persons of Indian nationality or origin returning to India for permanent residence on or after November 1, 1977 are entitled to avail themselves of foreign exchange to the extent of 25 percent of the amount they brought in on transfer of residence, plus the balance held in their Nonresident (External) Accounts and Foreign Currency (Nonresident) Accounts for cer- tain specified purposes for which exchange is normally not freely available. Persons eligible under the scheme may make use of the exchange facility within a period of ten years from the date of return of the head of the family. Gold Detailed control is exercised over the acquisition, possession, manufacture, and disposal of gold through the Administration of Gold (Control) Act. There is a ban on private possession of primary gold. Although there is no ban on possession of finished articles of gold (including coin) previously declared, there are restric- tions on their manufacture and acquisition. There is no restriction on the acquisition, disposal, or possession of gold ornaments, except that holdings of such ornaments (which may be of any purity) above specified limits must be declared. The consumption of gold by industrial users is regulated through permits and authorizations. Control is exercised over dealers and goldsmiths through a system of licensing. Gold refining is under state manage- ment. The Government Mint is licensed to accept tenders of gold for purposes of refining and conversion into standard gold bars. Forward trading in gold or silver is prohibited; exports of silver bullion, sheets, and plates are banned, and exports of products of silver are subject to quota restrictions. With the exception of jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler, imports of gold in any form by residents other than the monetary authorities require special authorization from the Reserve Bank and are not normally permitted; in certain cases, however, jewelers are permitted to manufacture gold jewelry in bond from imported gold, for export purposes only. Under the Gold Jewelry Export Promotion Replenish- ment Scheme, exporters of ornaments and articles made of gold of not less than 0.5833 fineness are entitled to the replenishment by gold (imported by the State Bank of India and supplied at prices notified by the Government) against Release Orders issued by the licensing authori- ties, provided that they satisfy "value added" and other requirements of the scheme. Special permission for imports of gold and silver is granted only in exceptional cases where either no foreign exchange transaction is involved or the metals are needed for a particular purpose. Special permission is also granted when the gold or silver is imported for processing and re-export, provided that payment for the import will not be ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution required, that the entire quantity of metal imported will be re-exported in the form of jewelry, and that the value added will be repatriated to India in foreign exchange through an authorized dealer. Exports of gold in any form other than jewelry produced in India for export with a gold value not exceeding 10 percent of total value, and jewelry con- stituting the personal effects of a traveler, subject to certain monetary limits, are prohibited, unless the export is made by or on behalf of the monetary authorities. Under the gold jewelry export scheme, net export of gold from India is not permitted, and the export of gold jewelry is permitted only if the value added is 15 percent or more; export under the scheme to the Bilateral Group of countries is not permitted. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement January 24.

Imports and Import Payments April 12. The import and export policy for 1985-88 was announced, retaining the broad structure of policy evolved in recent years. The major new features were: ( I) The category of automatic licensing was abolished and a large number of items were put on OGL. (2) To increase the availability of imports, 201 items of indus- trial machinery were placed on the list of capital goods importable under OGL. (3) To provide protection to indigenous industries, 67 items of raw materials and components were transferred from OGL and the Auto- matic Permissible List to the Limited Permissible List; 7 items were transferred from the Limited Permissible List to the Restricted List; 20 items from the Canalized List to the Limited Permissible List; and 16 items to the Restricted List. In addition, four items of capital goods were removed from the list of capital goods importable under OGL. (4) Authorization was granted for Govern- ment departments to import their requirements under OGL, subject to specified conditions. (5) The import policy for computer systems was liberalized by allowing imports of less than Rs 1 million ( c . i . f .) under OGL by all persons for their own use (at a higher rate of customs du ty than for such imports requiring prior clearance from the Department of Electronics). (6) Fifty-three items were removed from the Canalized List, but imports of "methanol, all types" were required henceforth to be canalized through the State Trade Corporation, and imports of certain iron and steel items, to be canalized through the Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation of India Ltd. (7) The limit of capital investment in small- scale industrial undertakings and in ancillary units was raised from Rs 2 million and Rs 2.5 million to Rs 3.5 million and Rs 4.5 million, respectively. (8) The policy on imports of spares for after-sales service was extended to the consumer electronics industry. (9) The value limits for the purposes of the utilization of REP licenses by manufacturers-exporters were raised. (10) A new Import/Export Passbook Scheme was introduced (with effect from January 16, 1986) for exporters of manufactures to provide duty-free access to imported inputs for export production. Wider in scope than the Advance Licensing Scheme, the Scheme was intended to avoid the need to obtain advance licenses repeatedly. ( I I) The scope of the Duty Exemption Scheme for advance licenses for imports of raw materials required for the production of intermediate and finished products was enlarged. (12) The concept introduced under the 1984/85 budget of eligibility for additional licenses based on the net realization of foreign exchange was 289 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INDIA extended to the prescribed growth rate for certificate renewals for export and trading houses. (13) A provision was introduced enabling a renewal of an export or trading house certificate in the event of shortfalls in the prescribed performance. (14) The prescribed growth rate in the scheme for entrepreneur/merchant exporters ex- porting certain products from the small-scale and cottage sector was reduced from 50 percent to 20 percent ( i .e ., the same as the projected rate for export houses). (15) Authorization was granted for sales of gold orna- ments and articles at approved exhibitions by organizers other than HHEC and its associates. (16) Trading houses and export houses with minimum exports of Rs 10 mil- lion in the preceding year were allowed to import technical designs, drawings, and other documents re- quired for their supporting manufactures to the extent of Rs 2.5 million and Rs 1 million, respectively, against their own REP/Additional Licenses. (17) Authorization was granted for importation of capital goods against REP licenses by small-scale industries (SSIs) and non-SSIs whose exports of select products were less than the minimum prescribed 10 percent of their production but were more than Rs 10 million, up to imports of Rs 0.5 million in the case of SSIs, and up to Rs 2 million in the case of non-SSIs. (18) The minimum limit for imports of capital goods against REP licenses was raised from Rs 0.1 million to Rs 0.2 million in the case of registered exporters, irrespective of their level of export performance. (19) The value limit per unit to cover foreign exchange requirements for the importation of balancing equipment (with an impact on the quality and/or quantity of output, acquisition of technical know-how, foreign consultancy services, etc.) under the Technical Development Fund was increased from US$0.5 million to the U.S. dollar equivalent of Rs 10 million. (20) Authorization was granted for exporters to import one slide projector, an Vi6 mm. projector, one word processor, one paper shredding machine, and teleprinters, without restriction on number but within an overall value of Rs 1.1 million. (21) Export houses and trading houses with a specified export performance were allowed to import an electronic telephone exchange for their use against their REP/Additional Licenses. (22) Special facilities for imports of capital goods, raw materials, etc. were to be available henceforth only to those nonresident Indians or persons of Indian origin who were returning to India for permanent settlement, for setting up industries, or for investment in industries in India. (23) Turnkey project exporters and project contractors were allowed to import under OGL construction equipment, machinery, spare tools, accessories, and office equipment that were in use for projects abroad. (24) The following steps would be taken to liberalize the import licensing and approval system: (a) in the case of applications for imports of capital goods, the maximum requested amount that could be considered by the regional licensing authorities and the Ad-Hoc Licensing Committee in the office of the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports was raised from 290 Rs 2 million in each case to Rs 2.5 million and Rs 10 million, respectively; (b) in regard to supplemen- tary licensing for actual users, the regional licensing authorities were empowered to deal with the applications for supplementary licenses for items appearing in Ap- pendix 3, Part A (limited permissible items), up to a limit of Rs 0.5 million for small-scale units and Rs 5 million for large-scale units; and (c) as a means to expedite issuance of advance licenses, Regional Ad- vance Licensing Committees would be established in Calcutta, New Delhi, Madras, and Bombay. May 29. Imports of terephthalic acid (TPA) were shifted from the OGL List to the List of Limited Permissible Items. June 7. The procedure for submitting supplementary license applications for iron and steel items was simplified. June 13. Imports of saturated fatty alcohols were shifted to the List of Limited Permissible Items. June 28. Regional Advance Licensing Committees were instituted. July 31. Zaire was added as a new market for exports of all engineering products listed in Group "A," Appen- dix 24, thereby making exports to that country eligible for the higher import replenishment rate of 11 percent instead of 10 percent. September 5. Imports of photo-composing phototype and phototype-setting systems were allowed under OGL, up to specified limits. September 10. Imports of rayon grade wood pulp were transferred to the List of Limited Permissible Items. September 11. Imports of certain laboratory and reagent chemicals were allowed under OGL. October 8.

Not for Redistribution Imports under the duty exemption scheme were re- stricted to one port only, and exports were allowed through any port except in the case of sensitive items restricted to specified ports. (This last measure was reversed on March 13, 1986.) It was also decided that the requirement of 50 percent of exports of own manufacture would not be insisted upon in the case of renewal of export house certificates for 1985—86. For the purpose of reckoning exports of new products and for new markets, the exports effected in any year since 1983-84 would be considered, but the benefit would be given only once. Switchover from merchant export houses to manufacturer-exporter houses would be allowed, provided that export performance and growth rate as merchant exporter had been achieved. November 7. The import and distribution policy in respect of raw cashew nuts for 1985-86 was announced. November 15. REP was allowed against exports of spare components of certain engineering items. Exports and Export Proceeds February 1. The Reserve Bank instituted a Composite Allocation of Foreign Exchange (CAFEX) Scheme, under which eligible companies could receive foreign exchange permits for specified amounts, valid for one year, provided that foreign exchange for a minimum of Rs 0.1 million for the purpose of business travel or other expenditure abroad had been released to such companies against ad hoc exchange permits during the year preced- ing the date of applications. Holders of CAFEX permits would be able to acquire foreign exchange from autho- rized dealers' branches when sending representatives abroad for export promotion and other business-related purposes. April 12. The export licensing policy for the next three-year period was announced incorporating the fol- lowing changes: (a) exports to Pakistan were accorded the same treatment as exports to other permissible destinations; (b) exports of silk wastes, other than nonmulberry silk waste, would be considered on merits; but exports of nonmulberry silk waste (namely, tassar, eri, muga, and mulberry-pierced cocoons) would not be allowed; (c) exports of acetone, phenol, and acetic anhydride would be allowed on merit; (d) exports of rayon filament yarn would be allowed within a speci- fied quantitative limit; (e) exports of sodium chloride IP/BP/GR/EPC grade would be allowed under OGL-3; (f) exports of wollastonite would be allowed within a specified limit; (g) exports of monochloro-acetic acid and acetic acid would be allowed on merit; (h) exports of camels for breeding purposes only would be allowed on merit; (i) certain equine breeds were brought under export trade control regulations, and their exports were to be allowed on merit; but exports of Kathiwari, Marwari, and Manipuri breeds of horses would not be permitted; (j) exports of the following items would not be allowed: (i) manufactured products of common fox skins, hill fox skins, desert cat skins, red fox skins, civet cat skins, jungle cat skins, and jackal skins; (ii) paddy INDIA (rice in husk); (iii) seeds of all oilseeds and pulses; and (iv) charcoal of all types other than activated charcoal/ activated carbon; (k) minimum export prices for speci- fied items were raised as follows: Item Previous Price New Price 1.

Not for Redistribution INDONESIA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Indonesia is the Indonesian Rupiah. The exchange value of the rupiah is determined by Bank Indonesia under a system of managed float. The U.S. dollar is the intervention currency. On Decem- ber 31, 1985 the buying and selling rates for telegraphic transfers in the Bourse were Rp 1,123.5 and Rp 1,127.00, respectively, per US$1. Exchange rates for certain other currencies1 are determined on the basis of the rates in the Jakarta Bourse for the U.S. dollar and rates for the currencies concerned in international mar- kets. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. In the Bourse, daily calls for exchange are conducted under the management of Bank Indonesia. Bidding for exchange is restricted to the authorized foreign exchange banks, nonbank financial institutions, and licensed foreign exchange dealers. Bank Indonesia stands willing to trade unlimited amounts of foreign exchange or rupiah with authorized traders at its intervention rates for the day. Bank Indonesia also offers authorized banks and nonbank financial institutions certain facilities for swap transactions in U.S. dollars. Administration of Control Under the country's liberal system, administration of the exchange and trade system is entrusted to Bank Indonesia, the Ministry of Trade, the Ministry of Finance, foreign exchange banks, and the customs authorities. Exchange control is administered by Bank Indonesia and the Ministry of Finance. Prescription of Currency Payments and receipts must be effected through the authorized banks and are normally effected in convert- ible currencies. Indonesia maintains no operative bilat- eral payments agreements. Nonresident Accounts There are no restrictions on the opening by residents or foreign nationals of accounts in Indonesia in rupiah or foreign currencies with authorized foreign exchange banks. For exchange control purposes, no distinction is made between resident and nonresident accounts. How- ever, if the account holder wishes to withdraw funds, a letter must be sent to the bank; no checks may be drawn on foreign currency accounts. Currencies commonly used in Indonesia's international transac- tions, that is, Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Hong Kong dollars, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Malaysian ringgit, Nether- lands guilders, New Zealand dollars, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Singapore dollars, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. Imports and Import Payments There is a registry of authorized importers, and an initial deposit is required for registration. Only Indone- sian nationals can be authorized as importers, although foreign investors are permitted to import the items required for their own projects. Imports from Angola, Israel, and South Africa are prohibited, as are imports from all sources of most secondhand goods and of specified commodities. Im- ports of many goods have long been restricted to approved importers, which are often state enterprises. Imports of chemical industry products, heavy equipment and spare parts, machines, machine equipment and spare parts, electric and electric industrial products, and metal industrial products must be effected by registered im- porters approved by the Minister of Trade. Importation of automotive spare parts and textiles is subject to the same registration and approval requirements. Importers of products within a given product group must have a license from the Ministry of Trade within that group. No restrictions are placed on the number of licensed import- ers in each category. Certain categories of agricultural imports, including 46 different categories of food, beverages, and fruits can be imported only by registered importers designated by the Minister of Trade. The procurement policies of companies approved for the importation of fruit, alco- holic beverages, chickens, and eggs are evaluated annually by the Government, although explicit quantita- tive restrictions are not placed on these products. Imports of steel products in the form of steel slabs, steel sheets for vessels, hot-rolled steel sheet in coils, and other specified hot-rolled sheets are controlled by the Government and can be made only by Persero Niaga (a state-trading company), acting on behalf of PT Krakatau Steel, a government-owned steel mill. Importation of a number of products is handled by state monopolies as follows: finished products made of iron or steel may only be imported by PT Dharma Niaga and PT Kerta Niaga; imports of off-the-road tires may only be executed by PT Dharma Niaga and PT Pantja Niaga; imports of brake fluids and lubricating fat are made solely by PT Pantja Niaga and PT Tjipta Niaga; and HVS-type paper and manifold, onionskin, seed, corona, reinforced and draw- ing paper, and HVO litho may be imported only by PT Pantja Niaga. A revised tariff schedule is applied under which there is a total of 11 tariff rates with a range of 0-60 percent. In addition, a value-added tax of 10 percent is levied on the c . i .f. value of imported goods, including import duties. Designated luxury goods may incur import duties of higher than 60 percent or they may be subject to a specific import duty. Certain commodities are granted favorable duty treatment within the framework 293 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INDONESIA of Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) preferential arrangements. Imports to Indonesia are subject to pre-shipment inspection in the country of origin by the Societe General de Surveillance (SGS); the inspection cost is borne by the Indonesian Government. Following inspection, SGS is required to issue a survey report (LKP) specifying the type, quality, quantity, and estimated cost of the goods, the applicable tariff code, freight charges, import duties, and value-added taxes, and to send the LKP to an Indonesian bank designated by the importer, which in turn should send the bill of lading and the LKP to a foreign exchange bank. Following payment of duties (which are determined on the declared c . i . f. value or the c . i . f. value as estimated by SGS, whichever is higher) and taxes to the bank, the importer is given the bill of lading and the validated LKP, which must be presented to customs for the release of the shipment. Although it no longer examines goods or collects import duties, the Directorate General of Customs and Excise must grant approval before imported goods are released from ports. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Angola, Israel, and South Africa are prohibited, as are exports to all countries of gold ore, pure gold, silver ore, and pure silver; rawhides of cattle; certain categories of unprocessed or low-quality rubber; certain logs and timber; all types of waste paper (from Java and Madura); scrap of bronze and copper (except from Irian Jay a); iron scrap; steel scrap; fertilizers; rice; sugar; kapok seeds; antiques of cultural value; and raw rattan. Exports by state enterprises must be effected in vessels operated by Indonesian companies. Registration of authorized exporters is required. Ex- ports of certain domestically produced commodities are controlled by means of quotas, or a requirement of prior authorization from the Ministry of Trade in order to maintain supplies to meet domestic demand and to encourage domestic processing of certain raw materials.2 Concern with domestic price stability sometimes in- volves suspension of exports of various items on this list. The prior authorization of the Minister of Trade is required for the export of flatbark crepe, cinchona bark, clove seeds, pepper seeds, silver exported by PN Aneka Tambang, and all goods produced from subsidized raw materials. All other commodities may be freely exported by registered private firms and state-trading firms, except for exports of plywood, which need approval from the joint-marketing body for plywood exports. There are no restrictions on the type of financial arrangement exporters may use. There is no surrender requirement for export proceeds. To calculate export taxes on the principal commodities other than petroleum and gas, the sale prices must not be lower than the "indicative" prices determined periodically by the Minis- 2Items affected by such controls include logs, fertilizer, cement, construction reinforcements of iron, automobile tires, paper, asphalt, stearin, cattle, salt, wheat flour, sugar, maize, soybeans, rice, copra, coconut oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, olein, and meat. 294 ter of Trade. Exports of certain products are subject to an export tax: palm oil, coconut oil, and a few other commodities are subject to a 5 percent tax; the major mineral products (excluding bauxite ore and concen- trates), to a 10 percent tax; and semiprocessed rattan, unsawn timber (logs), and natural sands, to a 20 percent tax. A few products are also subject to an additional export tax, including sonokeling wood (8.1 percent), ramin wood (0.75 percent), ebony (20.84 percent), and miscellaneous woods (6.75 percent). Starting from April 27, 1985, export taxes and additional export surtaxes are collected by foreign exchange banks and transferred weekly to the account of the state general treasurer at Bank Indonesia. For exports based on letters of credit, taxes are settled at foreign exchange banks at the time of negotiation of export bills, while for exports without letters of credit, taxes are settled at the time of registration of export notifications. For exports with consignment and usance letters of credit, taxes may be collected at the time of receipt of payment from abroad by foreign exchange banks or w i th in 180 days from registration of export notification at the foreign exchange bank. Under the Export Certificate Scheme, exporters of specified products are eligible for a rebate of customs duties and import sales taxes paid on imported inputs.3 To qua l ify, an exporter must submit an application to the Ministry of Finance, providing such information as the sources of imported raw materials, their c . i . f. values, import duties and other taxes paid on imported raw materials, and the f .o .b. price of finished products being exported. The objective of the scheme is to reimburse the exporter for all indirect taxes he has paid on imported inputs. The rate of tax rebate is expressed as a percentage of the f .o .b. value of exports. Once the rate of tax rebate is determined for a specific product, it is applied to all exporters of the same product without further proof of the use of imported inputs until a new rate is determined. At present, some 2,500 items are eligible for the Export Certificate Scheme. These consist exclusively of manu- factured goods, and the rates of certificates range from 1.5 percent to 20 percent. Eligible goods are checked by SGS at the country of destination in order to determine the amount of payment due the exporter. Export certificates may be used by the exporter to pay other taxes or be cashed at the Treasury. Certain commodities produced in border regions may be exported to Malaysia and the Philippines in exchange for certain eligible goods. In this "border-crossing" trade with Malaysia, the value of import or export transactions must not exceed M$600 a month, whether transported overland or by sea; for the Philippines, the value of imports or exports must not exceed the rupiah or peso equivalent of US$150 for a single trip if transported by seagoing vessel or US$1,500 if transported by smaller boat. 3The Export Certificate Scheme has been scheduled to be replaced by a du ty drawback system in April 1986. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Beginning from January 1982, the Indonesian Gov- ernment may, at its option, require all foreign firms bidding for government-sponsored construction or pro- curement projects to agree to fu l f i ll a counterpurchase obligation.4 Bidders for projects that include counter- purchase requirements must submit with their bids a letter agreeing to purchase and export the equivalent of the contract's value in selected Indonesian products (f .o .b .) during the life of the contract.5 Goods eligible to be used in fu lf i l l ing the counter- purchase requirement include agricultural products, manufactured and other products, excluding petroleum, natural gas, and items subject to export quotas. Lists of eligible products and services are issued periodically by the Department of Trade. Exports of labor services may also be used to fu l f i ll counterpurchase obligations. The foreign supplier may fu l f i ll the counterpurchase requirement either directly or through a third party, possibly from another country that is acceptable to the Indonesian Government. Such an arrangement must meet the condition of "additionally"; i.e., the counter- purchases by the third party have to be in addition to regular imports from Indonesia. The transference of counterpurchase obligations may be managed by a bank, but the primary responsibility for fulfillment of the requisite countertrade rests with the contractor. When a firm acts to fu l f i ll a counterpurchase obliga- tion, it must meet one of two requirements: (a) if it has not previously exported Indonesian products, its exports of acceptable products must fu lf i ll the counterpurchase obligation not later than three months prior to the termination period of the contract; and (b) if the firm has exported Indonesian goods during the preceding year, qualified exports during the current year must exceed those of the previous year by at least the value of the counterpurchase obligation. Failure to fu lf i ll one's counterpurchase obligations may result in a penalty of up to 50 percent of the counterpurchase shortfall. Final payment to the foreign supplier will not be made until after the countertrade has been effected. Counterpurchase sanctions have yet to be imposed. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles These are not restricted or subject to control. Proceeds from invisibles need not be surrendered. Travelers may take out and bring in any amount in foreign bank notes but only Rp 50,000 in Indonesian notes and coin other than gold and silver commemorative coins (see section on Gold, below). 4Projects or parts thereof financed with concessional loans as well as with credits from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the Islamic Development Bank are exempted from such requirements, as is the procurement of sophisticated technology and professional services and procurements involving joint ventures between state enterprises and foreign investors. 5Contract value for this purpose is defined as being net of what the contractor spends on Indonesian supplies, taxes, duties, and wages paid within the country. INDONESIA Capital Foreign capital invested in Indonesia is governed primarily by the Foreign Capital Investment Law of January 10, 1967, and subsequently amended by a number of Presidential Guidelines and Decrees. In principle, such investments may be undertaken only through a joint venture with an Indonesian partner. All investments in Indonesia require the approval of the President on the recommendation of the Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM). Enterprises that are wholly or largely operated in Indonesia as separate business units must be incorporated under Indonesian law and must have their domicile in Indonesia. The operating permit for foreign investment is usually valid for a maximum of 30 years. With the introduction of the new income tax law on January 1, 1984, existing investment incentives for foreign capital investment in the form of tax holidays, investment allowances, loss compensations, and exemp- tions from dividend taxes have been formally abolished. The incentives currently applied for foreign investments are: exemption from the capital stamp duty and from import duties on capital goods, raw materials, auxiliary goods, and spare parts; an annual depreciation allowance of 25 percent for fiscal purposes on virtually all ma- chinery and other productive capital goods; and deferral of certain taxes on imports of capital goods. Investors are granted the right to make capital repatria- tion, to transfer profits (after settlement of taxes and financial obligations in Indonesia), and to make transfers relating to expenses connected with the employment of foreign nationals in Indonesia, and in respect of depreci- ation allowances. The law provides that no transfer permit shall be issued for capital repatriation as long as investment benefits from tax relief are being received; at present, however, foreign payments do not require a transfer permit. There are no limitations on the remittance to Indonesia of capital in the form of foreign exchange or com- modities. Both residents and nonresidents may hold foreign currency deposits with foreign exchange banks. However, foreign exchange banks and nonbank financial institutions are subject to Bank Indonesia directives with respect to borrowing abroad, the acceptance of deposits from nonresidents, and the issuance of certificates of deposit to nonresidents. A 15 percent reserve require- ment is applicable to the foreign currency liabilities of foreign exchange banks; no reserve requirements are applicable to the foreign borrowings of nonbank financial institutions or private companies. Certain bor- rowing abroad is subject to clearance by Bank Indonesia, and all foreign borrowing is subject to reporting to Bank Indonesia and the Ministry of Finance. The prior approval of the Minister of Finance is required before any public enterprise or public sector body may accept a loan from abroad. Indonesian citizens and residents of foreign nationality may freely transfer, negotiate, import, and export securi- ties denominated in rupiah or in foreign currency. 295 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INDONESIA The exploration and development of petroleum re- sources are governed by the Petroleum Law of 1960. Gold Indonesia has issued two commemorative gold coins, which are legal tender. Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold and gold coins in Indonesia. Exports of gold ore and pure gold, unless made by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, are prohibited. Travelers may freely take out up to Rp 65,000 a person in Indonesian commemorative gold and silver coins issued in August 1970 and up to Rp 130,000 a person in gold and silver coins issued in October 1974; amounts in excess of these limits require the prior approval of Bank Indonesia. Gold may be imported free of license only by importers designated by the Government. Such imports require prior notification to the Ministry of Industry and are subject to an additional levy of Rp 25 per US$1. Changes During 1985 Imports and Import Payments January 21. Imports of special plastic raw materials were limited by type and amount to designated importers appointed by the Minister of Trade. March 1. Starting March 1985, the etilin dibromide brand of pesticide was made subject to import restrictions. March 4. The Government of Indonesia signed the GATT Code on Subsidies and Countervailing Duties. April 1. A new import tariff schedule was introduced, with tariff rates ranging from 0 percent to 60 percent (previously the rate ranged from 0 percent to 225 per- cent). In addition, a value-added tax of 10 percent, applicable to the c.i.f. import price plus the tariff, was introduced, and luxury goods and other specified goods were made subject to higher import duties or specific taxes. April 4. In a major reform of the trade system, the Government issued Presidential Instruction No. 4/1985 and a series of follow-up regulations, specifying, inter alia, that imports would be allowed to enter Indonesian customs areas only if bearing a Laporan Kebenaran Pemeriksaan (LKP) (report of finding) issued by Govern- ment-appointed inspectors. LKPs would be based on an examination conducted by inspectors in the countries of origin; the inspection would involve, inter alia, verifi- cation of the type, quality, volume, price, and the rates of import duty and value-added tax (Pajak Pertambahan Nilai, or PPH). As part of the reform, exports were freed from customs examination, with the exception of speci- fied commodities, such as those subject to export restriction or bans, and commodities whose export tax or extra export tax had not been settled. In addition, verification of exports obtaining the Export Certificate (SE) would be done by the surveyors at the port of destination. April 11. It was announced that import invoices from Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia no longer required official approval. July 5. Trade relations between Indonesia and the People's Republic of China were normalized. Exports and Export Proceeds April 27. Responsibility for collecting export taxes was transferred from the Director General of Customs to the foreign exchange banks. Various dates during 1985. The export tax was eliminated on exports of coconut oil, palm kernel, raw stearin of palm oil, and refined, bleached, and deodorized stearin; the additional export tax was also eliminated on coconut oil, raw palm oil, raw stearin of palm oil, and refined, bleached, deodorized stearin, and palm kernel. July 26. The number of locations authorized for import and export activities was increased to 67 sea ports and 16 airports. 296 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Islamic Republic of Iran is the Iranian Rial, which is pegged to the SDR at Rls 92.300 = SDR 1. The official rate is determined daily on the basis of the SDR-rial rate and applies to all transactions, the preferential rate having been discon- tinued on December 19, 1984. On December 31, 1985 the official rates of Bank Markazi Jomhouri Islami Iran (the central bank) for the U .S. dollar were Rls 84.003 buying and Rls 84.453 selling, respectively, per US$1. Administration of Control Exchange control authority is vested in Bank Markazi. All foreign exchange transactions must take place through this Bank or authorized banks. Imports and exports are governed by regulations issued periodically by the Ministry of Commerce after approval by the Council of Ministers. Prescription of Currency Transactions with countries1 having clearing agree- ments with the Islamic Republic of Iran are conducted through the terms of those agreements. The un it of account of these agreements is usua l ly the U .S. dollar. Settlements w i th member countries of the Asian Clearing Union (Bangladesh, Burma, India, Nepal, Pakistan,2 and Sri Lanka) in respect of current transac- tions are required to be effected in Asian Monetary Units (AMUs). Final settlement, when necessary, takes place by converting AMUs to an agreed currency. Payments to and from Pakistan and Turkey relating to the exchange of goods and related services (excluding border trade and petroleum and petroleum products) are settled through clearing accounts maintained by the respective central banks in U .S. dollars; settlements in respect of petro- leum and petroleum products and certain services are made through special accounts held by the central banks of the three countries. Banking arrangements have been concluded with major Western European banks to establish "Special Accounts" for clearing payments related to the sale of crude oil in exchange for purchase of a variety of products and raw materials. Nonresident Accounts Foreign nationals may maintain rial accounts, as well as accounts in foreign currencies, with authorized banks. 'Bu lgar ia, People's Republic of Ch ina, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Poland, Romania, and U .S .S .R. 2Pakistan, being a member of a separate agreement w i th the Islamic Republic of Iran, settles its payments through that agreement instead of in the AMU. The balance of the rial accounts may only be used in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Imports and Import Payments All imports into the Islamic Republic of Iran are required to be authorized by the Ministry of Commerce before being registered by authorized banks. Imports from Israel and South Afr ica are prohibited. Some imports are made by government-operated import agen- cies (procurement and distribution centers); individual importers can also initiate the importation of goods, subject to the prior approval of the procurement and distribution centers. The import policy is re-examined periodically; at the end of each Iranian calendar year (commencing March 21), new export-import regula- tions, effective for the next year, are published by the Ministry of Commerce. The regulations distinguish between "authorized," "unauthorized," and "prohibited" goods. "Authorized" goods are those goods whose imports and exports, with due consideration for the regulations, are permitted. "Unauthorized" goods are goods whose export or import are temporarily prohibited by the Government or are contingent on fu l f i l l ing certain requirements (as explained in the relative tariff). "Pro- hibited" goods are transactions that are forbidden by Islamic Sharia or by the law. At the time of registration of imports, a registration fee of 2 percent of the value of the order, calculated on an f .o .b. basis, is collected by authorized banks. At the time of registration of some goods, importers must deposit with Bank Markazi, through an authorized bank, 15 percent of the c . i . f. value of the goods. Most food items and certain other commodities are exempt from the registration deposit. The registration deposit is refund- able upon presentation of the customs clearance certificate after the goods have been cleared through customs, or if the order is canceled. If less than 90 percent of the registration value is used, the amount of the registration fee refund will be in proportion to the unused amount of the registration order. Bank Markazi may permit, when necessary, the shifting of imports from the category in which a registration deposit is required to the exempt category, and vice versa. Most imports are subject to commercial benefit taxes, which are either specific or ad valorem and are imposed in addition to any applicable customs duty. Monopoly taxes, if any, are included in the commercial benefit taxes. The authorities specify in the export-import regulations the commercial benefit taxes for each year. These taxes are paid to the customs before customs clearance.

Foreign nationals working for the private sector or in organizations affiliated to or under govern- ment supervision in the Islamic Republic of Iran whose employment has been recognized as necessary by the Government may remit up to 40 percent of their net salaries, depending on their specialty; for physicians, up to 65 percent may be remitted, depending on location and condition of work. Persons needing medical treatment abroad may obtain foreign exchange up to the equivalent of US$10,000, contingent upon the approval of the High Medical Council of the Ministry of Health; additional foreign exchange can be obtained from Bank Markazi upon the presentation of validated bills for medical expenditures. The sale of foreign exchange to students studying abroad varies according to cost of living in the respective country, up to a maximum of US$750 a month; an additional allowance of 45 percent and 15 percent of the basic allowance is provided for the spouse and for each child. In certain cases where this allowance does not cover tuition, university fees and expenses are separately calculated and paid. Travelers leaving the Islamic Re- public of Iran may take with them up to Rls 2,000. Travelers of foreign nationality may not export more foreign currency than they imported. Import and export of any amount of foreign currency is allowed, provided that such amount was declared at the time of arrival. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of all commodities are subject to prevailing regulations on foreign trade. The commercial benefit tax and customs duty charged at the time of import of raw materials used in manufactured goods for export are refunded to the exporter after the export has taken place. Exporters of non-oil goods are allowed to import authorized goods up to the value of goods exported. Such exporters may transfer the declared foreign ex- change earnings to another individual for import of goods. The foreign currency proceeds from commodity exports are sold to banks authorized to deal in foreign exchange. Authorized banks accept export proceeds normally in currencies quoted by Bank Markazi. With the prior approval of Bank Markazi, other currencies may also be accepted. Exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from export of invisibles may be retained in a foreign currency account with an authorized bank. Transfers from such accounts do not require the prior approval of Bank Markazi. Travelers may bring into the country up to Rls 2,000 in Iranian bank notes. Capital Iranian nationals may retain their foreign exchange earnings, if earned abroad, in domestic foreign currency accounts with domestic authorized banks. Transfers abroad from such accounts do not require the approval of Bank Markazi. Foreign capital investment is supervised by the Organization for Investment and Economic and Technical Assistance, in the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance; repatriation of foreign capital can be made with the approval of this organization and Bank Markazi. The net short-term foreign liabilities of the commercial banks are subject to a reserve requirement of 27 percent. Gold No Iranian gold coins are legal tender. Residents may freely and without license purchase, hold, and sell gold and silver in the domestic market. Authorized banks may import gold and silver bullion with the prior approval of Bank Markazi. The import and export of gold for monetary purposes or for international settlements is reserved for Bank Markazi, while imports for industrial and dental use are effected by professional organizations at the official rate and subject to supervision by Bank Markazi; such imports are subject to customs du ty, the commercial benefit levy, and an import registration fee. Passengers may, without prior approval of Bank Mar- kazi, bring in jewelry with a value equivalent to Rls 5 million, which will be recorded in their passports so that the same may be exported; imports of personal jewelry with a value exceeding this amount require the approval of Bank Markazi. The export of Iranian gold coins for numismatic purposes requires prior approval by Bank Markazi. Changes During 1985 Prescription of Currency January 1.

Not for Redistribution IRAQ (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Iraq is the Iraqi Dinar, which is pegged to the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, at ID 1 = US$3.2169. The official buying and selling rates on December 31, 1985 were US$3.2249 and US$3.2088, respectively, per ID 1. Buy ing and selling rates for certain other currencies1 are also officially quoted, with daily quotations based on the buy ing and selling rates for the U .S. dollar in markets abroad. The Central Bank of Iraq undertakes transactions in the listed currencies only with authorized dealers. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Exchange control authority is vested in the Board of Administration of the Central Bank; this authority has been delegated to the Governor and his Deputy who act on recommendations submitted by an Advisory Commit- tee on Foreign Exchange. Certain approval authority has been delegated to the Department of Foreign Exchange of the Central Bank and to licensed dealers. Foreign exchange transactions must take place through a licensed dealer unless otherwise authorized by the Governor. Branches of the Rafidain Bank, the sole commercial bank, are licensed dealers. Import policy and the annual program are formulated by the Board for the Regulation of Trade and supervised by the Ministry of Trade. Prescription of Currency Settlements with foreign countries normally must be made in any of the listed currencies or by drawing on a nonresident account in Iraqi dinars, provided that the funds on the nonresident account were obtained origi- nally through credits in any one of the listed currencies. There are no bilateral payments arrangements. Payments to and receipts from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts The opening of a nonresident account requires the approval of the exchange control authorities. Nonresi- dent accounts are divided into ordinary nonresident accounts, which arise from transactions in respect of current payments, and special nonresident accounts, which arise from transactions in respect of capital transfers. 'Aus tr ian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. Imports and Import Payments Imports of commodities normally are handled by the socialized sector. All private imports are subject to licenses, except imports of materials constituting basic elements for development projects benefiting from the Law for Major Development Projects, No. 157 of 1973 (in respect of old contracts) or from the Law for Major Development Projects, No. 60 of 1985 (for new proj- ects). In principle, licenses are issued in accordance with an annual import program. Imports of all goods from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Imports of some commodities on a protection list are, in principle, prohibited from all sources. To finance the Export Subsidy Fund, a tax of 0.5 per- cent is levied on imports of capital goods and a tax of 0.75 percent is levied on imports of consumer goods. All imports subject to import duty are also subject to a customs surcharge of 15 percent of the applicable customs du ty. The Raf ida in Bank makes exchange available upon presentation of the exchange control copy of the import license, except in some instances where reference has to be made to the Central Bank. Imports financed by foreign exchange obtained by nonresident Iraqis are given special import licenses. The value of such imports could be invested in various projects in the country on behalf of the nonresident; earnings from such invest- ments are not transferable. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require permission. Ex- change is usually granted for educational and medical expenses abroad, freight on exports effected on a c. & f. basis, insurance premiums, royalties, etc. Exchange is not granted to merchants for the insurance abroad of their imports or exports. The Rafidain Bank is permitted, subject to the approval of the Central Bank, to transfer up to 50 percent of annual income accrued to Arab and foreign nationals resident in Iraq, unless the particular contract extends this limit up to 75 percent for old contracts or 60 percent for new contracts. Certain nonresident private sector companies that have contracts with public institutions in Iraq are permitted to transfer the amounts provided for in those contracts; those not employed under contracts may transfer abroad a monthly amount of ID 58 a person, or 60 percent of salary, w i th noncontractual workers in the socialist sector being entitled to whichever is the higher of the two l im i ts. The regulations provide, in principle, for basic ex- change allowance for tourist travel abroad on the basis of classification of foreign countries into two categories 299 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution IRAQ (first) and (second) as follows: the basic allowance for travel to a country in the first category is ID 300 a trip for each person 18 years of age or over (ID 150 for persons under 18 years of age) for each trip to Arab and socialist countries, Turkey, Cyprus, and Greece. For the second category, which includes all other countries, the basic allowance is ID 500 a trip for each person 18 years of age or over (ID 250 for persons under 18 years of age). Individual exchange allowance for official missions abroad for first category countries ranges between ID 30-60 a person a day depending on status and duration of missions; for second category countries, the allowance ranges between ID 40-75 per day. Students abroad are allocated a fixed amount in Iraqi dinars to be transferred to the country of their residence, except for certain countries (such as India, socialist countries, and North Africa) where students are paid a fixed amount in U .S. dollars. Travelers may take out ID 5 in Iraqi currency notes, which is considered part of the basic travel allowance, and the balance of that allowance in traveler's checks. Residents on pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia are permitted to transfer the equivalent of ID 250 allowance for personal expenses in addition to all other travelling expenses paid to the local travel agent. Half of this allowance is permitted for persons under 18 years. Exchange allow- ances for pilgrimage are unrelated to other traveling allowances during the year. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Israel and South Africa and exports of certain goods to all other countries are prohibited. The Board for the Regulation of Trade has authority to prohibit the export of any commodity when supply falls short of domestic demand. The export of certain items is reserved for the General Organization for Exports. All other exports are licensed freely. Exporters generally must undertake to repatriate their foreign exchange proceeds through the Rafidain Bank and to surrender them within two months after shipment. Under an export subsidy fund established in 1969 for the purpose of assisting non-oil exports, financial sup- port is limited to 25 percent of the value of the eligible exports. The scheme was intended to introduce Iraqi goods abroad, whether from the private or socialist sector, and to improve their competitive position by providing temporary assistance while markets for the commodities were established. An export item is ineli- gible for the subsidy if its import content exceeds 40 percent. All applications for assistance are reviewed by a special committee headed by the Chairman of the Export Organization within the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The subsidy fund continues to be financed with taxes on imports, but there are currently no exports receiving subsidies under the scheme, as all exports are considered to be viable without subsidy assistance. Surcharge levies by the Export Organization have been discontinued. 300 Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange receipts in excess of ID 50 from invisibles must be surrendered within three months to a licensed dealer. Travelers may bring in foreign ex- change, including currency notes (other than Israeli currency), in unlimited amounts, provided that the funds are declared on an exchange control form; amounts not intended to be taken out of the country are exempt from declaration. Travelers may bring in ID 25 in Iraqi notes, and Arab nationals of Bahrain, Kuwa i t, Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates may bring in ID 100 in such notes. Capital Nonresidents may import capital freely, except from Israel or South Afr ica, but they must deposit it with the Rafidain Bank; such deposits may be converted into local currency at the official rate, and repatriation to the country of origin is permitted. Under Resolution No. 1646 of the Revolutionary Command Council, enacted in November 1980, no foreign (defined as non-Arab) participation is allowed in the capital of private sector companies, but citizens of Arab states may participate with Iraqis in the capital of industrial projects and commercial companies. All transfers of capital abroad by residents, whether Iraqis or foreigners, require ex- change control approval. Special facilities allow Arab investors to bring in convertible currency; similar facilities permit Iraqi nationals abroad to open accounts at the Raf ida in Bank with foreign currencies that are freely transferable abroad. Iraqi nationals resident abroad (or their legal representatives) may withdraw from their nonresident accounts up to ID 10,000 a year in three installments to cover personal expenses inside the country. Under the Industrial Investment Regulation Law for private and mixed sectors (No. 115 of 1982), certain incentives and guarantees are granted to approved investments of domestic or Arab capital in Iraq. In addition, Arab capital invested in Iraq is accorded preferential treatment in different economic sectors. Arab farmers having contracts w i th the Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform are permitted to transfer abroad annually up to 50 percent of their individual net return, subject to a limit of ID 500. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in Iraq in any form other than gold bars. Imports and exports of gold in any form require the approval of the Central Bank. Iraqi citizens may bring in with them gold for personal use up to 250 grams of worked gold free of tax. Imports of worked gold in excess of 250 grams are subject to a du ty of 35 percent, and all gold transactions are required to be declared on a foreign exchange form at the point of entry. Iraqi residents may take out with them worked gold not exceeding 100 grams a person, subject to declaration; such gold should be brought back on return to the country. Nonresident Iraqis are allowed to ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution take out with them worked gold that they have already brought with them for personal use when they entered Iraq.

Not for Redistribution IRELAND (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Ireland is the Irish Pound. Ireland participates with Belgium, Denmark, France, the Fed- eral Republic of Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands in the exchange rate and intervention mech- anism of the European Monetary System (EMS). In accordance with this agreement, Ireland maintains the spot exchange rates between the Irish pound and the currencies of the other participants within margins of 2.25 percent (in the case of the Italian lira, 6 percent) above or below the cross rates based on the central rates expressed in European Currency Units (ECUs). The agreement implies that the Central Bank of Ireland stands ready to buy or sell the currencies of the other participating states in unlimited amounts at specified intervention rates. On December 31, 1985 these rates were as follows: • .

On Decem- ber 31, 1985 the official midpoint closing rate for the U.S. dollar was US$1.2485 per Ir£l. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. On February 15, 1961 Ireland formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control Exchange control is operated by the Central Bank. Much of the authority for approving normal payments is delegated to commercial banks authorized for this purpose (authorized banks). Import licenses, where necessary, are issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce if the goods are of an industrial nature or by the Department of Agriculture if they are agricultural in character; import licenses are also issued by the Depart- ment of Fisheries and Forestry and in some cases by the Department of Health or the Department of Justice. Import licensing is not used for exchange control purposes. Import and export controls are administered by the Revenue Commissioners. Prescription of Currency The administration of Irish exchange control is based on the distinction between entities that are permanently 302 resident in Ireland and nonresidents, that is, residents of other countries. The latter comprises two categories: (1) residents of EC member countries, and (2) residents of all other countries. Authorized payments may be made in Irish pounds or in any foreign currency. The proceeds of exports must be received in foreign currency or in Irish pounds from an External Account. Nonresident Accounts Accounts in Irish pounds of nonresidents are desig- nated External Accounts. All credits in excess of Ir£250,000 to External Accounts held by nonbanks with authorized banks require specific approval by the Central Bank (or Ir£50,000 when such accounts are held with financial institutions other than authorized banks), ex- cept where the credit is in respect of imports into Ireland. There are also limits on maximum balances in External Accounts of nonresident banks; these may be maintained without prior approval of the Central Bank. External Accounts may be credited with payments that are eligible for transfer abroad under a general or specific exchange control approval, with transfers from other External Accounts, payments for any foreign currencies pur- chased from account holders, the proceeds of Irish currency notes received from abroad in denominations not exceeding Ir£20, payments from within the country up to Ir£100 in value, and interest payable on the accounts; they may be debited for transfers to residents, transfers to other External Accounts, the cost of any foreign currency sold to account holders, the transfer of any part of account balances to account holders, and bank charges, if applicable. Authorized banks may operate foreign currency ac- counts in the names of nonresidents in any foreign currency; these accounts are subject to the same require- ments as External Accounts. Authorized banks may also operate foreign currency accounts in the names of residents under specific central bank approval. Imports and Import Payments The import of certain goods into Ireland is subject to five types of administrative control, as follows: Quantitative Restriction. Special quota restrictions apply to (1) bicycle tires from Albania, Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, the German Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Democratic Republic of Korea, the U .S .S .R ., and Viet Nam; (2) certain textile products originating in the state-trading countries; (3) automobile tires from the German Democratic Republic; (4) foot- wear from Czechoslovakia and Taiwant; (5) certain sacks and bags other than those of wool, cotton, and man-made fibers (mainly jute bags originating in Hong Kong, Japan, Macao, Malaysia, Pakistan, Taiwant, the state-trading countries, and Yugoslavia); and (6) certain tSee Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part Two, page 75. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ceramic products originating in the People's Republic of China and Romania. Autonomous import restrictions have been imposed by the EC on certain textiles originating in Taiwant and Turkey and on fats of bovine cattle, etc., for industrial uses, certain fertilizers, and certain bleached paper and paperboard made in the United States. Voluntary Restraint. The EC has negotiated bilateral restraint agreements with various supplying countries on trade in textiles under which import quotas are set each year for different products. Surveillance. Ireland operates a system of surveillance on certain imports of the following: live plants or floricultural products, iron and steel products, clothing and textiles, footwear, twine, cordage, motorcar types, copper tubes, certain ceramic products, and sanitary fixtures. National Public Policy. For reasons of national pol- icy, imports of certain goods (e.g., specified drugs, explosives, and firearms and ammunition) are prohibited without special licenses. Prior Permission. Under this type of control, prior permission of the Central Bank is required before orders may be placed for goods if they are not to be used in Ireland, or are to be delivered more than nine months after the date of the order, or if payment is not being made in an approved manner. Goods not for use in Ireland must, in general, be paid for with borrowed foreign currency. Imports from non-EC countries of products covered by the Common Agricultural Policy of the EC may be subject to various charges such as levies and monetary compensatory amounts under that policy and to duties under the common customs tariff. For permitted imports, permission to make payments to nonresidents is granted automatically. Authority to make payments is delegated to authorized dealers. Exchange control forms are required for import payments exceeding Ir£l0,000. Payments for Invisibles Payments to nonresidents require approval. Approval to make payments for most invisibles is delegated to the authorized banks; for other invisibles, it is given by the Central Bank. For tourist travel there is a basic allowance in foreign currency for residents of Ireland of Ir£500 a person for each trip, or when the trip exceeds two months, Ir£2,000. For business travel, up to Ir£3,000 at a rate of Ir£100 a day is allowed for each journey. Limits are also established for allowances for education and other purposes. Applications for larger amounts are approved, provided that no unauthorized export of capital is involved. Not more than Ir£500 of an allowance of foreign currency may be issued in the form of currency notes. Residents may also take with them up to Ir£100 in Irish currency notes. Nonresidents may take with them any foreign currency notes that they brought into Ireland. tSee Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part Two, page 75. IRELAND Exports and Export Proceeds A system of export licensing is applied to a limited range of goods. Exporters of goods must obtain payment for the goods within six months of shipment, if their value exceeds Ir£100. When payment is received in foreign currencies, the exchange must be offered for sale to an authorized bank. Exchange control forms are required for exports exceeding Ir£l0,000 and must be produced to Irish customs at the point of exportation. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles must be repatriated without delay, and if foreign currencies are received they must be offered for sale to an authorized dealer or permission for their retention must be obtained. Any foreign currency held by a person after his return from a trip abroad may be retained for subsequent travel purposes for three months from the date he received the exchange. There are no limitations on the import of Irish or foreign bank notes, but prior central bank approval must be obtained to credit Irish bank notes in denomina- tions exceeding Ir£20 to External Accounts. Capital Exchange control approval is required for all transfers of capital to nonresidents. Authority to make certain payments has been delegated to authorized dealers; other payments require central bank approval. The normal allowance available to Irish residents on emigration is Ir£40,000 for each family. When the total value of an emigrant's assets exceeds Ir£40,000, the transfer of the excess amount is restricted for a period of four years from the emigrant's redesignation as a nonresident, that is, from the date of departure from Ireland; however, during this four-year period, income on restricted assets may be transferred abroad. After the four-year period, the balance of restricted assets may be freely exported without limit. For Irish residents taking up permanent residence in an EC country, including those taking up employment, applications to transfer Irish assets to the new country of residence in excess of the normal allowances are considered. There are no restrictions on the inflow of capital, but inward direct investment requires exchange control approval. Purchases of unquoted Irish securities by nonresidents require exchange control approval, and the purchase of nonurban land by foreign nationals in some cases requires approval by the Land Commission. Incoming capital received in foreign currencies must be offered for sale to an authorized dealer. The Central Bank considers applications by Irish residents for permission to purchase property for per- sonal use in a member country of the EC with foreign currency purchased at the official rate of exchange. The acquisition of personal property outside the EC may be financed only by foreign currency loans, which are approved by the Central Bank on application, subject to a limit of Ir£20,000 a property and one property for each 303 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution IRELAND family un i t. Borrowings may be repaid with official foreign exchange in equal annual installments over a period of not less than five years. The entire foreign currency proceeds from the sale of property outside Ireland purchased for personal use of a resident must be offered for sale to an authorized dealer. Transactions in foreign currency securities are con- trolled to ensure that, in general, capital is not trans- ferred outside Ireland. All such transactions must be routed through an approved agent (an Irish bank, stockbroker, or solicitor). Resident holdings of all foreign currency securities may be sold only to nonresi- dents. Where such securities are sold, the proceeds must either be reinvested in foreign securities or be offered for sale to an authorized dealer within three months. During that three-month period, in the absence of the specific approval of the Central Bank, the proceeds must be held under the control of an approved agent. Purchases of foreign currency securities, apart from switches referred to above, are prohibited. The Central Bank may, however, approve applications by authorized insurers and pension funds for the export of a limited amount of funds at the current rate of exchange for investment in foreign currency securities. Foreign currency borrowing by institutional investors and professional portfolio managers for portfolio investment abroad may also be approved in some cases. The Central Bank will grant permission for investment at the current rate of exchange in securities issued by the EC, the European Investment Bank, the European Coal and Steel Community (ESCC), and the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM). Such permission is granted only on an undertaking by the intending buyer that the securities will not be resold for at least one year from the date of purchase authorization, a requirement that applies also to purchases made from the sale or maturity proceeds of existing holdings. In line with this requirement, all sales of existing holdings of EC securities are subject to exchange control approval. Direct investment abroad requires prior approval and may normally be financed by borrowing foreign cur- rency; in certain cases the use of official exchange may be approved, depending on the merits of the project. Use of official exchange is allowed, however, for all ap- proved new direct investments by Irish residents in EC member countries. Purchases by nonresidents of Irish registered securities must be funded with foreign currency or Irish pounds from an External Account; purchases in excess of Ir£100,000 require notification to the Central Bank. Remittances of cash gifts or personal loans are normally permitted up to Ir£ 1,500 a donor a calendar year. Applications by Irish residents to make cash gifts to EC residents, in excess of the normal allowance, are considered. Residents require prior exchange control approval (1) to accept loans from nonresidents, irrespective of the currency of such loans, and (2) to accept loans in foreign currency from any source; such applications are consid- ered on their merits and, except as regards borrowing for the acquisition of property for personal use, on the benefit likely to accrue to the economy. Public sector borrowing from nonresidents is undertaken following consultation with the Central Bank. Lending of Irish currency to nonresidents is not normally permitted, except to the extent that overdraft facilities may be provided by the banks to members of diplomatic and consular missions in Ireland. Provided that the company is not a channel for portfolio investment, a subsidiary or branch of a company controlled directly by interests in EC countries may obtain from Irish banks, subject to exchange control approval, all the financing it requires for its operation in Ireland. Gold Residents may freely hold, buy, borrow, sell, or lend gold coin in Ireland. Dealings in gold bullion are restricted, and no dealings take place in Ireland. Al- though there are no import restrictions, residents require specific exchange control permission to purchase gold coin or bullion outside Ireland. Specific exchange con- trol permission also is required for the export of gold coin and bullion outside Ireland. Specific permission to buy or export gold coin or bullion normally is given only for bona fide numismatic or industrial purposes, respec- tively. Residents of Ireland are not permitted to hold gold abroad. Changes During 1985 Imports and Import Payments January 1.

Not for Redistribution ISRAEL (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Israel is the New Sheqel (plural, Sheqalim).1 The authorities do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions but intervene when necessary to smooth out fluctuations in rates and to maintain orderly conditions in the market. From July 1, 1985, and in conjunction with the program for economic stabilization introduction on that date, the representative rate was set at IS 1,500 per US$1 (equivalent to NIS 1.5 per US$1). On December 31, 1985 the noon midpoint exchange rate of the new sheqel in terms of the U .S. dol- lar was NIS 1.4995 = US$1. Authorized banks are permitted to deal in foreign exchange, and a levy of 1 percent of transaction value is imposed on purchases of foreign exchange by the public, including those involv- ing foreign currency-denominated PATAM accounts (see below). Administration of Control Exchange control is the responsibility of the Control- ler of Foreign Exchange and is administered by the Bank of Israel, in cooperation with other government agen- cies, and is carried out through authorized banks. Prescription of Currency Payments and receipts must be effected in the cur- rency and manner prescribed by the exchange control authorities. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents' funds are held either in foreign currency accounts or in local currency accounts. The opening of nonresident foreign currency accounts does not require prior approval. The holder may freely effect transfers from his foreign currency account. He may also convert funds held on the account into local currency at the market rate of exchange. There are no restrictions on the opening by a nonresi- dent of a local currency account; such funds may be used locally in permitted transactions, including transfers between nonresidents. The sales proceeds of real estate and other investments may be transferred in their entirety if the original investment was made through an autho- rized dealer with foreign currency or State of Israel Development Loan bonds.

In addition, residents may maintain PATAM accounts that are time or deposit accounts denominated in foreign currency; the minimum term for interest-bearing PATAM time deposits is one year. Banks are required to redeposit 100 percent of PATAM demand and time deposits with the Bank of Israel. However, no new deposits in sheqalim can be made on PATAM accounts with a maturity of less than one year; but existing deposits in these accounts continue to be convertible into sheqalim at any time. PATAM-Restitution accounts are also demand or time deposit accounts in convertible currencies with autho- rized banks, which must redeposit all of these foreign currency funds with the Bank of Israel. Funds deposited in restitution accounts are free of taxation. PATAM- Restitution accounts are permitted to be used up to a limit of US$1,800 for payment of expenses in connec- tion with travel and subsistence abroad in excess of the basic travel exchange allocation. Holders of PATAM- Restitution accounts may resell securities bought with funds in such accounts for foreign currency and may deposit the proceeds in a PATAM-Restitution account. Residents who are not holders of PATAM-Restitution accounts may deposit the foreign exchange proceeds from the sale of foreign securities in PATAM accounts with a maturity of 12 months. Imports and Import Payments A few imports are prohibited from all sources. With some exceptions, imports are free of licensing and administrative or quantitative restrictions. Some imports on a Restricted List are subject to approval; this list includes coffee, specified items of machinery, some meat, fish, and dairy products, sugar, certain textiles, explosives and inflammables, tobacco, and nonalcoholic beverages. Soybeans are imported exclusively by or for account of the Government. Exchange to pay for authorized imports is granted automatically by the banks upon presentation of certain documents (bills of lading and letters of credit) or for repayment of suppliers' credits. With specified exceptions, sales of foreign exchange for import prepayment have been suspended. A value-added tax of 15 percent is levied on almost all imported and domestically produced goods and services, other than capital goods and travel tickets. A 2 percent additional duty is levied on imports of goods subject to the value-added tax. Specified imports of 50 com- modities considered as luxury items are subject to a one- year noninterest-bearing deposit requirement of 18 per- cent of the value of imports, including customs du ty, 305 ©International Monetary Fund.

Payments for Invisibles Exchange for payments abroad on account of invis- ibles is provided automatically upon proof of the nature of the transaction. The exchange allowance for tourist travel is the equivalent of US$800 a traveler for each journey, of which up to US$500 may be in bank notes and the balance in traveler's or bank checks. A lower limit for tourist travel or the equivalent of US$500 a traveler for each journey applies in the case of children aged 12 years and below. The business travel allowance is US$120 a day, up to a maximum of US$2,400 a trip. A surcharge of 20 percent is applied on the value of travel tickets purchased in Israel. Foreign currency drawings by means of credit cards are included in the travel allowance. Resident travelers may take out Israeli bank notes not exceeding the equivalent of US$50 a person a trip. Israeli residents traveling abroad are subject on departure to a travel tax equivalent to US$100 a person a journey (US$50 for travel to Romania and no tax on travel to Egypt). Payments for hotel accommoda- tion, land transport, and other related services under foreign package tours, along with other imports of services, are subject to the value-added tax of 15 per- cent. Nonresident travelers leaving Israel are permitted to repurchase through authorized dealers foreign cur- rency up to US$100 and may not take out any Israeli bank notes. The right of a tourist to buy foreign currency, on presentation of documents showing pre- vious conversion of foreign currency into Israeli cur- rency, is limited during a visit to US$5,000 a person over 18 years of age and to US$2,000 a person under 18 years. Commercial banks are authorized to sell abroad unlimited amounts of Israeli currency. Exports and Export Proceeds Most exports do not require licenses, although for some commodities export licensing is retained for quality control. Export proceeds, which may be received in foreign currencies only, must be surrendered or held in a PAT AM account. Exporters may retain in a bank deposit abroad or in a special exporter account in Israel an amount equivalent to 10 percent of their turnover in the preceding year. For inputs directly imported by an exporter there is a system of rebates of customs duties, wharf charges, and other related charges. The Israel Foreign Trade Risks Insurance Company provides an export insurance facility to cover unfavorable move- ments in domestic currency costs as measured by movements in the weighted average rate of the sheqel against five major currencies, namely, the U .S. dollar, the pound sterling, the Netherlands guilder, the French franc, and the deutsche mark. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange proceeds from invisibles must, in general, be surrendered or kept in foreign exchange in PAT AM 306 accounts. Any resident is free to accept specified convertible currencies from tourists in payment for customary tourist services and commodities other than commercial exports, securities, and real estate. For 20 years after entering Israel, new immigrants are exempt from the requirement to surrender their foreign exchange to authorized dealers, and they may hold these foreign currencies freely with authorized banks in Israel or with banks abroad. There are no limits on the amounts of Israeli bank notes or foreign currency that may be brought in by travelers. Capital Foreign exchange brought into Israel for the purpose of investment in the form of loan and equity capital may, subject to approval, be granted preferential treatment in accordance with the Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investment, which grants a limited withholding tax of 25 percent on income resulting from these investments. Approved investments (loan and equity) are granted an exemption from the compulsory deposit requirement. Approvals granted under the law are classified as "approved enterprises," "approved invest- ments," or "approved loans." Approved enterprise status is granted to enterprises in selected fields of production that are (1) in the fields of industry, tourism, transporta- tion, and agriculture; (2) established in priority areas; or (3) export oriented or in the field of import substitution in some specific lines of production. Approved investment or approved loan status may be granted to any enterprise in the above-mentioned sectors; however, loans may only be shareholders' loans. The period of the loan should not be less than seven years and the rate of interest not more than 8 percent a year. Certain restrictions apply to borrowing in foreign currency by residents. A freeze is in effect on all such direct foreign borrowing by nonbank residents, other than suppliers' credits and loans with maturities of at least 30 months. Nonbank residents may, however, contract loans in foreign currencies from resident banks subject to an interest surcharge of 1 percent. Proceeds accruing from the repatriation or liquidation of foreign assets are treated in the same way as other proceeds in foreign currency. Residents are not normally permitted to retain abroad real estate, money, securities, or the income from these assets. Residents may not buy foreign securities abroad, with the exception of specified types of Israeli firms' securities issued abroad with the approval of the Controller of Foreign Exchange. Resi- dent exporters and airline and shipping companies may maintain foreign bank accounts. New immigrants may retain their foreign assets for 20 years. Transfers abroad of a capital nature by residents other than new immi- grants are generally not permitted. Emigrants are per- mitted to transfer their Israeli assets abroad up to the equivalent of US$2,000 per year. Nonresidents are permitted to purchase in Israel real estate and shares. In order to repatriate the principal or profits on these investments, proof is required by an ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution authorized dealer that they were purchased with foreign currency through an authorized dealer. Direct loans in any form from Israeli residents to nonresidents are subject to licensing. Investments abroad by Israeli residents are subject to a tax of 15 percent. Gold Gold bullion for industry may be imported by an importer holding an import license. Gold bullion and coins for investment, or certificates conferring a right to gold bullion, must be held in a gold custody account with an authorized dealer; beginning from January 1984, residents are not permitted to buy gold bullion or coins for investment purposes. The following bullion coins are at present included in a list of gold coins for investment: (a) Krugerrands of South Africa; (b) 50 dollar Maple Leafs of Canada; (c) 50 pesos of Mexico; (d) 100 corona and 4 dukat coins of Austria; (e) sovereigns of Great Britain; (f) 10 dollar and 20 dollar Liberty coins of the United States; and (g) 20 franc napoleon coins of France. Other gold coins and medallions may be bought, sold, or held by an Israeli resident without restriction. These coins may be imported and exported in the same manner as other goods. Imports of gold included in the above categories are subject to a value-added tax of 15 percent. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement July 1. The sheqel was devalued from IS 1,262.40 per US$1 to IS 1,500.00 per US$1, representing a devalua- tion of 15.84 percent. September 4. A new currency un i t, the new sheqel, (plural, sheqalim), was introduced, equal to 1,000 units of the former sheqel. The old and new currencies would be legal tender concurrently for the first year, and for a further year it would be possible to convert the old sheqel freely into the new sheqel. Resident Accounts in Foreign Currency July 1. It was announced that new deposits in PAT AM (i .e ., foreign currency-denominated) accounts of less than 12 months maturity could no longer be effected in sheqalim; withdrawals from existing PAT AM accounts into sheqalim would continue to be permitted. Imports and Import Payments February 5. The six-month ban on importation of some 50 commodities considered to be luxury items was lifted and replaced by a 60 percent sheqel noninterest- bearing advance deposit requirement. The deposit re- quirement was scheduled to be reduced subsequently by 3 percent a month. April I. The 2 percent temporary import levy was extended for another year, until March 31, 1986. April 4. The requirement, first imposed on July 25, 1984 and renewed on November 1, 1984, that imports of noncommercial motor vehicles should be financed with foreign credit, was abolished. ISRAEL July 1. The noninterest-bearing advance deposit re- quirement of 15 percent for one year on a range of imports, which had been extended on June 1, 1985 until November 30, 1985, was abolished; the remaining advance deposit requirement on 50 commodities consid- ered to be luxury items was reduced from 45 percent to 30 percent and was to be further decreased, as an- nounced in February 1985, by 3 percent a month. August 1. The suspension of foreign exchange sales for import prepayment was further extended until Aug- ust 1, 1986, with the exceptions permitted from August 1, 1984 ( i .e ., cases where prepayment was included in a long-term approved credit arrangement; the amount of prepayment was under US$500; or a specific prepayment requirement was included in an import agreement dated before July 25, 1984). August 19. A free trade area agreement was signed between Israel and the United States. The agreement, which came into effect in September 1985, called for a gradual phasing-out over a ten-year period of tariffs on all trade between the two countries, except for a limited category of sensitive goods. Payments for Invisibles February 10. The temporary suspension on the use of credit cards abroad by Israeli residents was ended, and authorization was restored for the use of credit cards abroad within the limits of the foreign currency allowance. February 17. The foreign travel tax was increased until October 16, 1985 from the equivalent of US$100 to US$150 a person for each journey abroad, to be adjusted at monthly intervals in line with the consumer price index. In addition, travel to Egypt, which had previously been tax exempt, was made subject to a travel tax of US$50 a person until October 16, 1985. February 19. A 20 percent surcharge was imposed on airline and ship tickets purchased in Israel. May 20. The foreign currency allowance for Israeli citizens traveling abroad was reduced from US$1,000 to US$800 an adult a journey. May 27. The foreign travel tax was doubled (until September 15, 1985) to the equivalent of US$300 a person for each journey abroad (from US$50 to US$200 in the case of travel to Egypt). June 16. The general authorization for an Israeli employer to pay wages in foreign currency to an Israeli citizen working abroad was canceled; henceforth, the employer would need a specific authorization from the Controller of Foreign Exchange in order to make such payment. July 23. The right of a tourist to buy foreign currency against documents showing the conversion of foreign currency into Israeli sheqalim was limited for each visit to US$5,000 for a person over 18 years of age and to US$2,000 for a person under 18 years. November 13. A law providing for a 15 percent tax on imports of services was introduced to cover the period through March 31, 1987, following expiration of a 307 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ISRAEL similar such law introduced on November 13, 1984, for a 12-month period. Exports and Export Proceeds July 1. It was announced that directed credit for exports would henceforth be denominated entirely in U.S. dollars (and not permitted in sheqalim as pre- viously), and would bear interest at a rate equivalent to 2 percentage points over LIBOR. Capital February 4. The minimum term for foreign exchange denominated interest-bearing time deposits (PATAM deposits) was raised from three months to one year. Existing deposits (for three and six months) were allowed to continue to bear interest until maturity. April 4. Authorization was restored for Israeli resi- dents to effect payments by drawing on foreign commer- cial overdraft accounts. (Such transactions had been effectively precluded by the suspension of voluntary prepayment of foreign obligations on July 25, 1984, renewed on November 1, 1984.) June 16. The prohibition against making advance repayments on foreign loans received by Israeli citizens from companies abroad was relaxed to cover, hence- forth, only those loans that were not a part of the overall credit ceilings. In addition, the maximum amount of foreign currency that a foreign resident could purchase before leaving Israel, without documentary evidence that a larger amount had been brought into the country, was reduced from US$500 to US$100. July 1. It was announced that new deposits in PATAM accounts of less than 12 months' maturity could no longer be effected in sheqalim; withdrawals from exist- ing PATAM accounts into sheqalim would continue to be permitted. July 23. The right of foreign residents to acquire Israeli securities from Patach (foreign exchange) ac- counts was limited to the purchase of shares (excluding shares under the bank arrangement of October 1983). An exempt person converting foreign currency with an authorized agent could reconvert into foreign currency only six months after the date of such conversion. November 13. A levy of 15 percent was imposed on outward foreign investments, intended by the authorities as a means of closing a loophole that had enabled enterprises to avoid the tax on imported services by investing abroad, particularly in subsidiary companies. 308 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ITALY (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Italy is the Italian Lira. Italy partici- pates with Belgium, Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands in the exchange rate and intervention mech- anism of the European Monetary System (EMS). In accordance with this agreement, Italy maintains spot exchange rates between the Italian lira and the currencies of the other participants within margins of 6 percent above or below the cross rates based on the central rates expressed in European Currency Units (ECUs). The agreement implies that the Bank of Italy (the central bank) stands ready to buy or sell the currencies of the other participating states in unlimited amounts at specified intervention rates. The participants in the EMS are not maintaining the exchange rates for other curren- cies within fixed limits. However, in order to ensure a proper functioning of the system, they intervene in concert to smooth out fluctuations in exchange rates, the intervention currencies being each other's and the U.S. dollar. Official rates for 20 foreign currencies1 are quoted daily on the basis of market rates.2 On December 31, 1985 the rate for the U.S. dollar was Lit 1,678.0 per US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. For outward transfers of resident-owned capital, a deposit in lire of 25 percent must be lodged with the Bank of Italy; for the acquisition of shares of foreign investment funds operating in Italy and investing in Italian securities at least 50 percent of the funds raised in Italy, the required deposit rate is 25 percent; no deposit is required in the case of foreign investment funds investing in Italian securities all of the funds raised in Italy. Outward direct investment and portfolio investment up to 10 percent of the funds raised in the domestic market by Mutual Investment Funds are, however, exempt from the deposit requirement. The monetary authorities do not, in principle, inter- vene in the forward exchange market; forward premiums and discounts are normally left to the interplay of market forces. Authorized banks are allowed to engage in spot exchange transactions in any currency, and in forward exchange transactions up to 12 months in major convert- ible and externally convertible currencies.3 Forward cover is freely permitted only for commercial transac- 1 Currencies officially quoted are Australian dollars, Austrian schil- lings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, ECUs, Finnish markkaa, Greek drachmas, French francs, Irish pounds, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and U .S. dollars. 2The official rate is the average of the "fixing" quotations of the foreign exchange markets in Milan and Rome. 3These currencies are referred to in the Italian regulations as the conto valutario currencies. tions; cover in respect of financial transactions requires authorization. Italy formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from February 15, 1961. Administration of Control The exchange control system is operated by the Italian Exchange Office (Ufficio Italiano dei Cambi, or UIC). All sales and purchases of exchange must be effected through banks authorized for this purpose. Import and export licenses, when required, are issued by the Ministry of Finance at the request of the Ministry of Foreign Trade. Certain imports and exports require the prior visa of the National Foreign Trade Institute. Issues of securities by nonresidents require the prior approval of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and are subject in addition to the rules governing the issuing of Italian securities in Italy. Payments to and from the Republic of San Marino or Vatican City are made in internal lire and therefore are not subject to exchange control. The net external position of the banks is subject to control by the UIC. This control encompasses (1) the net foreign position in foreign currencies and lire together, the banks being forbidden to maintain a net foreign asset position; (2) the overall position, spot and forward combined, in all foreign currencies, a position which must be balanced on a daily basis; and (3) outstanding net forward transactions against lire, which are subject to a ceiling set for each bank. The banks are prohibited from maintaining a net foreign asset position; in addi- tion, outstanding net forward transactions against lire are subject to a ceiling set individually for each bank. Prescription of Currency Settlements with foreign countries must normally be made in convertible currencies or in lire on Foreign Accounts. Nonresident Accounts The main types of accounts in Italian lire which nonresidents are allowed to maintain with authorized banks are Foreign Accounts and Special Accounts.4 The use of these accounts is described below. 4I ta l ians l iv ing or working abroad as well as "border-area" residents are permitted to maintain w i th Italian banks Emigrants' Foreign Currency Accounts denominated in conto valutario currencies. They may be credited w i th remittances ( inc lud ing bank notes) sent directly to the bank from abroad (up to 80 percent of the holder's wage or salary earnings) and w i th interest on the balance; they may be debited freely for conversion into lire, for w i thdrawa ls in foreign bank notes, and for transfers abroad (except for accounts held by "border-area" residents). These accounts may also be held by Italian representatives abroad and by Italian staff employed by international organizations located in Italy. 309 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ITALY Foreign Accounts may be credited with transfers from other Foreign Accounts, from Capital Accounts, and from Special Accounts Under Law No. 43, with lire from authorized current and capital payments, and with the proceeds from sales of convertible currencies. They may be debited for purchases of any of these currencies in the ordinary market, for transfers to any other Foreign Account, Capital Account, or Special Account for payments to residents of Italy for current and capital transactions, and for drawings in cash by the holder of the account or his nominee. Capital Accounts may be credited with transfers from Foreign Accounts, from Special Accounts, and from other Capital Accounts and with the proceeds from the liquidation of foreign investments in Italy not made under the provisions of Law No. 211 or Law No. 43 (see below). Capital Accounts may be debited for transfers to any other Capital Account or to Foreign Accounts and for the purchase of investments, including purchases of personal property or real estate in Italy. Special Accounts Under Law No. 43 of February 7, 1956 are accounts in the names of nonresidents who have invested in Italy convertible currencies or exter- nally convertible currencies in accordance with the above-mentioned law. These accounts may be credited with the countervalue of convertible currencies sold in Italy, with transfers from Foreign Accounts, or from other Special Accounts, and with the proceeds from sales of investments that have been made in accordance with Law No. 43. They may be debited for purchases of the same currency that was originally sold and for invest- ments in Italy, and balances may be transferred to Foreign Accounts, Capital Accounts, or any other Special Account. Nonresidents may also maintain ^foreign accounts in foreign exchange" to which may be credited foreign exchange receipts from abroad, transfers from other "foreign accounts in foreign exchange," payments from residents for authorized transactions and, in approved cases, receipts from the sale of assets. Imports and Import Payments Imports are governed by a Ministerial Decree of May 6, 1976. The import regulations vary with the country of origin. Countries are grouped in three major areas: Zone A, which is subdivided into subzones A/1 (EC countries, Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Mar- tinique, and Reunion), A/2 (overseas countries and territories, member countries of the European Free Trade Association, and other countries associated with the EC), and A/3 (third countries); Zone B, which comprises member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), Albania, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; and Zone C (Japan). The import control procedures distinguish between goods that may be freely imported without quantitative restrictions and goods that require a special license. Import liberalization is virtually com- plete for subzones A/1 and A/2, while very few quan- 310 titative restrictions remain for subzone A/3. Many types of goods from Zones B and C are heavily restricted. For imports from countries in Zone B, as well as Yugoslavia, the country of origin must also be the country of shipment. Imports from non-EC countries of most products covered by the Common Agricultural Policy of the EC are subject to variable import levies that have replaced all previous barriers to imports. Common EC regulations are also applied to imports from non-EC countries of most other agricultural and livestock products. For imports not exceeding Lit 10 million in value, no exchange control form is required; for imports from Lit 10 million to Lit 100 million in value, a form completed by the importer is required; for imports over Lit 100 million in value an import document already completed by an authorized bank is required. Where settlement takes place more than 12 months after importation, the importer must choose an authorized bank as his bank of domicile, through which he must carry out all payments operations. Deferred payments for imports are permitted freely if settlement is to take place within five years after importation. Advance payments for imports require approval when they are to take place more than 4 months before importation, except that a 10 percent advance payment may be made up to 12 months before importation. Advance payments in excess of Lit 10 million must be made with foreign currency borrowed from authorized banks. When pre- payments for imports exceed Lit 20 billion, an advance deposit of 5 percent is required. For all authorized imports, the authorized banks provide exchange or permit payment in Italian lire to a Foreign Account, provided that appropriate payment terms are observed (see section on Capital, below). International postal money orders may be used for import payments, subject to a limit for each remitter and foreign beneficiary. Payments for Invisibles The authorized banks may sell foreign exchange for payments for invisibles provided that the necessary documents are submitted. Their authority to sell ex- change for remittances as grants and aid is limited to Lit 2,500,000 a year, and approval of the UIC is required for transfers by immigrants in Italy for more than ten years if the amounts exceed certain limits or if the transfer is to a country other than the country of origin. Exchange is granted freely for remittances of earnings or investments. Residents may use international postal money orders for payments, up to a maximum amount of Lit 2 million for each remitter and foreign beneficiary. Payments for services are governed by the same provi- sions regarding advance and deferred payments as are payments for imports. Certain transactions (but not the related payments) in respect of services are subject to approval by the Ministry of Foreign Trade. All contracts for insurance of ships and aircraft must be approved by the Ministry of Industry. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution There are no limits on expenditures for tourism. Residents traveling to foreign countries may obtain from the banks exchange equivalent to Lit 1,600,000 a person a trip, and additional expenditures for tourism may be met by bank transfers or the use of credit cards. Authorized banks may grant foreign exchange without limit for business, medical treatment, and education, provided that they are satisfied that this is justified in view of the duration and purpose of the trip. The limit on the amount of Italian bank notes that can be taken out is Lit 400,000 in any denomination for each visit abroad.5 Nonresident travelers may take out any amount in foreign bank notes that they have previously declared upon entry, and the equivalent of Lit 1 million a person if not previously declared, as well as Lit 400,000 in Italian bank notes of any denomination. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to any country of a few commodities in a special list (Tabella Esporf) require export licenses. For exports not exceeding Lit 10 million in value, no exchange control form is required; for exports from Lit 10 million to Lit 100 million in value, a form completed by the exporter is required; for exports exceeding Lit 100 million in value, an export document already completed by an authorized bank is required. If settlement takes place more than 12 months before exportation, the exporter must effect the payments operations related to his export transactions through an authorized bank as his bank of domicile. Advance payments for exports may be received freely if exportation is to take place within five years. Deferred payments for exports to non-OECD countries are per- mitted if settlement of at least 90 percent is to take place within 18 months after exportation and the balance within 24 months.6 Except in the case of exports to OECD countries on delayed payment terms of up to five years, settlements beyond 18 months from shipment are subject to approval by the Ministry of Foreign Trade for amounts exceeding Lit 5 billion or by the UIC for amounts up to Lit 5 billion. In all other cases such receipts require the prior approval either of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, or (for up to Lit 50 billion) of the Autonomous Agency for Export Credit Insurance (SACE), or of the Mediocredito if the payment term granted to the foreign importer is less than eight years, depending on whether the transaction will be covered by state insurance or financed at a preferential interest rate under Law No. 221/77. All export proceeds must be surrendered to authorized banks within 15 days of effective receipt. Proceeds in U .S. dollars, Canadian dollars, Japanese yen, Australian 5 Persons living in border areas may not take out more than Lit 50,000 a day in domestic bank notes and coin, and the equivalent of Lit 50,000 a day in foreign notes and coin. 6On January 16, 1986, a requirement (abolished October 16, 1985) that exporters should provide foreign financing for 75 percent of exports made on deferred payment basis for up to 18 months was reintroduced. ITALY dollars, and externally convertible European currencies may be retained by authorized banks on behalf of the recipients in "Foreign Exchange Accounts" for up to 15 days, during which period such balances may be used for permitted transactions or sold to authorized banks; the banks are allowed to sell these currencies to residents for authorized transactions or to negotiate them freely with * the UIC or among themselves. In cases where documentation is not in order at the time of surrender, proceeds may be posted to "Ordinary Waiting Accounts" for a period of up to 30 days from the date of surrender. If the necessary documents are not received until after the 30-day waiting period, the proceeds must be assigned to the UIC upon completion of the transaction and will be converted into lire at the lowest exchange rate quoted during the waiting period. Export proceeds may also be received by international postal money order, and in certain circumstances, in foreign bank notes that are accepted in the country of issue for credit to bank accounts, balances in which are convertible at official market rates. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from current invisibles are subject to the same collection, retention, and surrender requirements as receipts from exports. Shipping and insurance compa- nies and travel and forwarding agencies may keep Operating Accounts (Conti Autorizzati) in U .S. dollars, Canadian dollars, Japanese yen, Australian dollars, and externally convertible European currencies; unutilized balances must be surrendered periodically. Residents may not retain foreign bank notes left over from trips abroad above the equivalent of Lit 100,000 but must sell them to an authorized bank. Persons may bring in any amount in foreign bank notes and Lit 400,000 in Italian bank notes in any denomination. Capital Inward and outward movements of nonresident capital are free, but most loans from nonresidents to residents and from residents to nonresidents require specific authorization from the Ministry of the Treasury in agreement with the Ministry of Foreign Trade; long-term loans (other than loans from financial institutions to nonresidents) from member countries of the Organiza- tion for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) for establishing or maintaining lasting eco- nomic relations, and loans to relatives up to the third degree of relationship, and some loans from certain German institutions to identified Italian residents do not require authorization. Short-term loans (up to one year and not exceeding Lit 500 million) and medium-term (not exceeding Lit 3 billion) financial loans (i .e ., loans not connected with commercial operations or the perfor- mance of services) from EC countries and medium-term (not exceeding Lit 1 billion) financial loans from other OECD countries also do not require authorization. Repayment of such loans may be made freely. 311 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ITALY A deposit requirement applies to outward transfers of resident-owned capital for portfolio investments, financial loans, purchases of real estate, and personal capital movements. The transferor must lodge a lira deposit equivalent to 25 percent of the amount trans- ferred in a noninterest-bearing account with the Bank of Italy. The rate is 12.5 percent for acquisitions of shares of foreign investment funds operating in Italy, provided that no more than 50 percent of the corresponding resources are invested abroad. Investments in foreign securities by Italian mutual funds are exempt, within a limit of 10 percent of their total assets. In addition, when foreign investments are transferred between residents against lire, the transferee is subject to the deposit requirement, regardless of the date when the investment was made. Transfers among residents of shares of foreign investment funds authorized to operate in Italy are exempt from the deposit requirement. The deposits are released only when, and to the extent that, disinvest- ment operations occur, and their release requires the prior approval of the Bank of Italy. Reinvestments of funds in new issues or on the secondary market are exempt if the original investment was made prior to July 27, 1973. Purchases by residents of certain bonds issued by specified EC institutions are also exempt. Prior approval of the Ministry of Foreign Trade is required for an Italian company to establish an overseas financial holding company; the parent company mus t, inter alia, submit annual audited accounts of such a holding company to the Ministry. Foreign investment in Italy is, in principle, governed by Law No. 43 and subsequent implementing regula- tions. Foreign investments of any kind, including both direct and portfolio investment and the purchase of real estate, are permitted freely, and no restrictions are applied to their repatriation. Direct investment in OECD countries by physical or juridical persons (other than participation by credit and insurance institutions in a foreign company not having the same corporate purpose) is permitted in any form and without any limit.7 Direct investment in other countries may be made only by juridical persons in firms that are in the same line of business as that of the Italian firm making the investment; other types of direct investment in such countries require special authorization from the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The general license to make these investments also covers the reinvestment of earnings and the use for this purpose of the liquidation proceeds of previous investments (after crediting the proceeds of the disinvestment to bank accounts similar to those established for proceeds from exports and invis- ibles; see section on Proceeds from Invisibles, above). Residents are free to buy and sell, through the Bank of Italy or the authorized banks, any foreign securities issued or payable abroad and quoted on foreign stock exchanges, and to deal in such securities among them- selves against payment in lire. Such foreign securities, 7Financial investment, that is, investment not intended to establish permanent relations, is not considered direct investment. The regula- tions governing direct investment are also not applicable to partici- pations in "holdings" abroad of any k ind. 312 except securities of Lit 300,000 or less, have to be deposited with an Italian bank or with a bank abroad for an account of an Italian bank. The purchase by residents of shares of foreign mutual funds requires prior ap- proval. In practice, a resident is able to purchase freely shares of foreign funds that have received authorization from the Ministry of Foreign Trade to sell their shares in Italy, since that authorization is valid also for the individual resident subscriber. Such authorization is given only to funds meeting certain requirements, including the investment in Italian securities of funds raised in Italy. Residents do not require authorization to purchase real estate in EC countries. All issues of securities by nonresidents on the Italian capital market require the prior approval of the Ministry of Foreign Trade after consultation with the Bank of Italy. Issues are normally restricted to international institutions. Transfers in connection with donations and inher- itances may be made freely. The transfer of property of residents leaving Italy permanently is allowed in two stages: the equivalent of Lit 10 million a person is allowed upon presentation of specified documents to an authorized bank at the time of leaving Italy, and the remainder is subject to examination of the documents by the UIC, when residence has been established abroad. Gold Residents may freely hold and negotiate gold in any form in Italy, with the exception of unrefined gold imported under ministerial license for industrial pur- poses. The monetary authorities may freely acquire unrefined gold abroad. Authorized banks may acquire unrefined gold abroad, under authorization of the Minis- try of the Treasury and the Ministry of Foreign Trade, to sell it to Italian firms authorized by the Ministry of Foreign Trade for industrial use. Exports of wrought and semimanufactured gold, other than jewelry, are subject to licensing. Imports of unrefined gold are not subject to value-added tax. Importation and exportation of gold coins that are legal tender in a foreign country are prohibited in the absence of a special authorization. Imports of other gold coins for numismatic purposes are free but subject to value-added tax at 18 percent. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement July 22. As part of a realignment of exchange rates within the European Monetary System, the central rate of the lira in terms of the ECU was changed to Lit 1,520.60, and the new central rates and intervention margins against the EMS currencies were set as follows: Deutsche mark Netherlands guilder Belgian franc French franc Irish pound Danish krone Lower Central Upper 639.78 679.325 721.31 567.86 31.943 208.63 1,976.46 176.18 602.915 33.9177 221.532 2,098.60 187.069 640.20 36.014 235.22 2,228.29 198.63 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution October 22. The Australian dollar was added to the list of officially quoted currencies under the conto valutario system. November 4. The requirement that the foreign position of commercial banks should be balanced on a daily basis separately in (a) U .S. dollars, (b) EC currencies and ECUs, and (c) all other conto valutario currencies combined, was abolished. Administration of Control December 5. The limitations on the foreign debt exposure of banks were lifted. (Such exposures had been frozen at the levels of June 30, 1984.) Imports and Import Payments October 23. The m in imum value of import transac- tions requiring foreign currency financing for advance payments was raised from Lit 5 million to Lit 10 million. November 8. The threshold value of import transac- tions requiring exchange control forms was raised from Lit 5 million to Lit 10 million, and a number of import items were exempted from this requirement, irrespective of value. In addition, the maximum value of import transactions exempt from the requirement of lodging import documents with the banks was raised from Lit 50 million to Lit 100 million. Payments for Invisibles October 24. Limits on the use of credit cards abroad by Italian tourists for purchases of consumer goods were relaxed. ITALY Exports and Export Proceeds January 12. The foreign currency financing require- ment for exports on deferred payment basis was lowered from 50 to 25 percent. October 23. The foreign currency export financing requirement was abolished. Capital June II. Sales by one resident to another of shares of foreign investment funds authorized to operate in Italy were exempted from the noninterest-bearing deposit requirement, and authorization was granted for acquisi- tion by nonresidents of shares in Italian mutual funds. In addition, the limits on financial loans that could be contracted abroad by residents without official authoriza- tion were increased to Lit 500 million for short-term lending, and to Lit 3 billion for medium-term lending from EC countries (Lit 1 billion for medium-term lending from other OECD countries). October 23. Changes were made as follows in regulations affecting capital movements: (a) the ban on transfers of foreign securities and credits among Italian residents was lifted; (b) the noninterest-bearing deposit requirement in lira in respect of portfolio investments abroad by residents was reduced to 25 percent for investments of a year or more (previously 30-50 percent, depending on the type of investment), and to 12.5 per- cent for acquisitions of shares of foreign investment funds operating in Italy; and (c) a similar compulsory deposit for direct investment abroad was abolished. 313 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution JAMAICA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Jamaica is the Jamaica Dollar, for which the spot exchange rate in terms of the U.S. dollar is determined at an auction conducted two times a week by the Bank of Jamaica (the central bank). On Dec- ember 31, 1985 the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, were J$5.46 = US$1 and J$5.50 = US$1, respectively. There are no taxes on sales of foreign exchange. The Bank of Jamaica's dealings against Jamaica dollars are confined to transactions in certain major currencies.l For spot dealings the commercial banks apply a commission charge varying between 2 cents and 15 cents per unit of foreign currency on sales and purchases of currencies of nonmembers of the Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM). For currencies of CARICOM members, the commercial banks apply a commission charge of 0.3361 percent on sales and a discount charge of 0.25 percent on purchases. Commercial banks are allowed to engage in forward transactions in respect of certain commercial transactions, subject to specified limits on their net uncovered positions. Jamaica formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from February 22, 1963. Administration of Control The Bank of Jamaica administers exchange control on behalf of the Minister of Finance, subject to certain limitations in respect of which the approval of the Minister is required. The commercial banks are desig- nated as authorized dealers. Except for the allowance for tourist travel (for which the commercial banks have authority to provide foreign exchange) and transfers from External Accounts, service payments, including capital, interest, and dividends require the specific approval of the Bank of Jamaica. Specific import licenses (for imports of goods on the restricted list) are issued by the Trade Administrator, who is responsible to the Minister of Industry and Commerce. Prescription of Currency Payments to all countries may be made by crediting Jamaica dollars to an External Account or in any foreign currency.2 Credits to external accounts or foreign cur- Austrian shillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Netherlands guilders, pounds ster- ling, Swiss francs, U .S. dollars, Norwegian kroners, Irish pounds, Japanese yen, Venezuelan bolivares, Mexican pesos, and the curren- cies of member countries of the Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM). The CARICOM countries are Antigua and Barbuda, Bar- bados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Christopher and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. 2 All currencies other than the Jamaica dollar are considered foreign currencies. All foreign currencies have been designated as specified currencies. 314 rency accounts must be received by debit of an External Account or in any foreign currency. Nonresident Accounts The commercial banks are empowered to open Exter- nal Accounts in Jamaica dollars for nonresidents, pro- vided that no credit of Jamaica dollars is made to the accounts without the specific approval of the Bank of Jamaica. The funds on these accounts may be transferred freely between nonresidents. External Accounts may be credited with payments by residents of Jamaica, subject to prior approval by the Exchange Control Authority, with transfers from other External Accounts, and with the proceeds from the sale to an authorized dealer of gold or foreign currencies. They may be debited for payments to residents of Jamaica, for transfers to other External Accounts, and for the purchase of foreign currencies. Accounts that are credited with funds that may not be placed at the free disposal of nonresidents of Jamaica (including the proceeds from the sale of undeveloped land) are designated Blocked Accounts. Blocked funds may be used without limitation by nonresidents for local expenditure while they are in Jamaica, and for invest- ment in Jamaica dollar securities or local mortgages, or both. Applications for the release of funds in Blocked Accounts in excess of J$5,000 a calendar year, for use in Jamaica by the nonresident owner, must be referred to the Bank of Jamaica. Imports and Import Payments Imports are subject, in principle, to a global annual ceiling. Imports originating from South Africa are prohibited. Raw materials and capital goods may be imported freely from virtually all sources on an open general license. Goods imported under open general license must be consigned from one of the permitted countries and must also originate in a permitted country. All other imports require specific licenses, irrespective of origin. As part of changes introduced on January 10, 1983, import permits, instead of import licenses, are issued to importers up to specified value quotas for items not on the restricted list. For some goods, licenses are not normally issued unless they originate in member countries of the CARICOM. 3 Certain food items and all motor vehicles may be imported only by a public sector agency, the Jamaica Commodity Trading Corporation. Beginning from March 1984, payments for imports other than those cleared through the customs prior to January 1983 are delegated to the commercial banks and can be settled without reference to the Bank of Jamaica. A Deposit Scheme was established in May 1984 for 3For import licensing purposes, the Bahamas is treated as a CARICOM member country. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution imports cleared through the customs prior to January 1983. Sale of foreign currency for such imports can only be made against foreign exchange permits approved by the Exchange Control Deparment. In respect of imports for which foreign exchange is sold without reference to the Bank of Jamaica, the importer must present to his commercial bank a copy of invoices or other evidence of purchase and value together with documentary evidence that the goods either have been shipped or are about to be shipped. Exchange Control approval is required for advance payments in excess of US$2,000. Importers may buy foreign exchange forward for a period of one to six months prior to the date of shipment of goods. Certain goods are subject to a consumption tax, whether they are imported or manufactured domes- tically. In addition, a 10 percent stamp duty tax is applied to imports, with the exception of Government imports, basic food items, crude petroleum, fuel for utility companies, imports from CARICOM countries, and most raw materials. These taxes are collected at the port of entry and are calculated on the sum of the value accepted for the customs duty. There are arrears in respect of payments for imports. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles require the approval of the exchange control authorities. Foreign exchange is not, as a rule, made available for remittances of income from emigrants' property in Jamaica, for remittances for family maintenance, or for cash gifts. In the case of transfers from emigrants' income and payments for family maintenance, limited exceptions may be ap- proved by the Minister of Finance on humanitarian grounds. All interest and dividends payable to nonresi- dent investors are approved without restriction, net of taxation. A basic exchange allowance of US$56 a person for each calendar year for foreign travel other than for business or professional reasons is made available to residents by authorized dealers. The sale of foreign exchange for travel for business and professional reasons is subject to the specific approval of the Bank of Jamaica and to daily limits of US$125 a day for the United States and US$175 a day for Europe. The number of days for which the approval is granted is determined on the merits of each case. Non-Jamaicans working in Jamaica under a work permit are allowed to remit abroad 30 percent of their gross salary during the period of their contract and their accumulated assets at the end of the contract period. Residents going abroad may take with them Jamaica bank notes not exceeding J$20 and other bank notes not exceeding the equivalent of US$56. Bona fide requests for additional amounts are approved by the Bank of Jamaica. Exports and Export Proceeds All goods other than those on the prohibited list may be exported to all countries, but a specific license is required for the export of certain agricultural products, JAMAICA ammunition, explosives, firearms, antique furniture, ready-made garments, gold bullion, mineral and metal ores, and antique paintings. Exporters are required to surrender their exchange proceeds to authorized dealers within three months from the date of shipment. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in foreign currencies must be sold to an authorized dealer. Residents returning to Jamaica may bring in Jamaica bank notes up to J$20 a traveler, provided that this amount was declared on leaving the country. Resident travelers are required to sell their holdings of foreign currencies to an authorized dealer upon return. Tourists are required to settle their hotel bills in Jamaica currency, which may be purchased at the exchange bureaus or at the commercial banks. Capital Outflows of resident-owned capital are restricted, irrespective of their destination. Investments abroad by residents and the purchase of local assets by residents from nonresidents require the approval of the exchange control authorities. Foreign exchange is normally not made available to residents to make cash gifts to nonresidents. With the exception of certain types of investment in real estate, all approved direct investments in Jamaica by nonresidents are granted "approved status," under which the investor is given written assurance that he will at any time be able to repatriate his original investment plus any capital gain. In order to obtain approved status, the investor must apply to the Bank of Jamaica. Nonresidents are normally not permitted to take up security in respect of loans made to Jamaican companies owned or controlled by them. Domestic bank credit to nonresidents and to nonresident-controlled companies is subject to selective credit controls; for this purpose, firms are considered to be nonresident-controlled when the controlling interest is held beneficially, either di- rectly or indirectly, by persons resident outside the CARICOM area. Such lending is subject to approval by the Bank of Jamaica. There is a fixed-term foreign currency deposit scheme for both residents and nonresidents. Accounts under this scheme may be credited with any means of payment, except cash or traveler's checks, but the transactions must be effected through a commercial bank; the deposits are freely repatriable upon maturity. In general, non-Jamaican nonresidents are not per- mitted to raise local mortgages. However, nonresidents working in Jamaica under a work permit may acquire a house to live in, with the permissible amount of mortgage restricted to 50 percent of the appraised value. Foreign nonresident owners of land in Jamaica, when selling to residents, are allowed to remit from Jamaica the amount they paid originally from funds brought into Jamaica. Beginning from March 6, 1985, if the property is fully developed, the gains are remittable over three years, i .e ., 331/3 percent each year, one year after the 315 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution JAMAICA realization of the gains. If the property is not fully developed, the gains are remittable over ten years, subject to a minimum remittance in any one year of the foreign currency equivalent of J$20,000.00. Foreign nonresident owners of a house built on resident lots may remit in full the proceeds of sale, pro- vided the unit is not sold prior to two years after the com- pletion of the construction and the vendor has conformed with the Taxation and Exchange Control Acts. Except for special cases, which may be approved by the Minister of Finance on humanitarian grounds, no foreign exchange is made available for remittances of capital or income to Jamaican nationals who have emigrated abroad and to beneficiaries under wills and intestacies. Gold Commemorative gold coins in denominations of J$20, J$100, and J$250 are legal tender but do not circulate. Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Jamaica for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents, other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users, are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Ministry of Finance; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. All commercial imports of jewelry require import licenses. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement December 17. A regulation was introduced under which funds allocated in the foreign exchange auction would be delivered only after validation of supporting documents by the Exchange Control Department. 316 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution JAPAN (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Japan is the Japanese Yen. The authorities of Japan do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions, and exchange rates are deter- mined, in principle, on the basis of underlying demand and supply conditions in the exchange markets. How- ever, the authorities intervene when necessary in order to counter disorderly conditions in the markets. The prin- cipal intervention currency is the U .S. dollar. The interbank rate for the U.S. dollar on December 31, 1985 was ¥ 200.60 per US$1. Authorized banks may freely carry out spot and forward exchange transactions with nonresident banks and among themselves. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Japan formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from April 1, 1964. Administration of Control The exchange control system is operated mainly by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), and the Bank of Japan acting as the Government's agent. Most of the authority for verifying normal payments is, however, delegated to authorized banks, referred to as foreign exchange banks. Import and export reporting requirements are handled by the MITI. Inward direct investments are under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Finance and other appro- priate ministers. Outward direct investment requires prior notice to the Minister of Finance. Prescription of Currency Payments to all countries may be made in any currency, including yen, and receipts also may be obtained in any currency. Nonresident Accounts Nonresident Accounts in yen may be opened by any nonresident with any authorized bank in Japan. There are no restrictions on credits to or payments from these accounts, and balances may be converted freely into any foreign currency. Payment of interest on balances in such accounts may be restricted when it is deemed necessary to prevent drastic fluctuations in the exchange rate of the yen. Imports and Import Payments Imports can be freely made, with the exception of specifically restricted items. The Import Restriction System covers 80 items, 27 of which have been communicated to the GATT as residual restrictions,1 'Imports of 4 of the 27 items in this category were liberalized on April 1, 1986. while the remaining items fall under the state-trading, national security, public health, and moral protection provisions of the GATT. For the restricted items, once the importer has obtained authorization from the MITI, he receives an import quota certificate that entitles him to receive an import license from an authorized foreign exchange bank automatically upon application. For the importation of certain other goods from specified coun- tries or shipping areas, individual authorization must be obtained from the MITI. Items under state trading include certain dairy prod- ucts, certain cereals, salt, raw silk, leaf tobacco, poppy straw, raw opium, and ethyl and denatured alcohol. Payment for imports may be effected up to two years before the import declaration or after customs clearance. Longer settlement periods require an import license from the MITI. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles may be made without any limitation. Gifts and donations to nonresidents (except relatives abroad) exceeding ¥ 5 million are referred to the Bank of Japan, which approves the payment after verifying its authenticity. However, remittances to rela- tives abroad, as well as other current payments for invisibles, such as the purchase of foreign currencies in connection with travel abroad, may be made without limit. Both residents and nonresidents may acquire foreign currency deposits with authorized banks in Japan and may take out freely any amount in any foreign currency; in the case of Japanese yen, the freely exportable limit is ¥ 5 million. Overseas deposits by resident individuals up to the equivalent of ¥ 10 million are subject to automatic approval by the Bank of Japan. Qualified Japanese enterprises in insurance, transportation, securities, etc. are permitted to acquire overseas deposits under blanket licensing. Exports and Export Proceeds Export restraint may be exercised by virtue of the Export and Import Transactions Law and an Export Trade Control Order issued under the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law. Export restraint may be applied either globally or to specified destinations, and it may cover export volume, or export prices, or other conditions. Following expiration at end-March 1985 of the voluntary restraint arrangement on exports of passenger cars to the United States, the Government announced its intention to limit voluntarily the quantities over the period April 1985 to March 1986. Exports of steel and some textile items to the United States and exports of videotape recorders to the EC are also subject to quantitative restrictions. At the end of 1985, there were 55 export cartels under the provisions of the Export 317 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution JAPAN and Import Transactions Law. Of these, 6 required prior notice of exporters' agreements in respect of export transactions, 13 required prior approval of manufactur- ers' agreements on domestic transactions in goods for export, and 36 required prior notice of a memorandum of an exporters' cooperative association in respect of export transactions. In addition, 208 items were subject to license under the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law, in order to control their export to specified socialist countries, or because of short supply in the domestic market (e.g., tungsten ore), or to forestall the imposition of import restrictions by other countries (e.g., on sewing machines and certain textiles). Exports under processing contracts and exports for which settlement is under the "special" method also require individual licenses. Exports of specified raw materials for foreign processing and reimport require individual licenses; "special" settlement methods are those effected by means of open account or those involving payment not earlier than two years after shipment. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles may generally be accepted without a license. Residents as well as nonresidents may freely bring in any amount in Japanese or foreign currency. Capital Capital transactions are permitted unless specifically restricted. Such specific restrictions may take the form of requiring (1) prior approval; (2) prior notice with a waiting period, during which the minister or ministers concerned may request or order that the transaction be suspended or its particulars be modified on the basis of prescribed criteria; or (3) prior notice without a waiting period. Other transactions are normally free. Under emergency conditions, most capital transactions not subject to specific restrictions may be subject to prior approval; emergency conditions are defined as situations in which a capital transaction might (1) make the maintenance of equilibrium in Japan's balance of pay- ments difficult; (2) result in drastic fluctuations in the exchange rate; or (3) result in an international flow of funds large enough to adversely affect Japan's money or capital market. A distinction is made between direct investment in Japan and other capital transactions. Besides majority equity ownership of enterprises or establishment of branch operations, other types of investment that come under the direct investment regulations include (1) any acquisition of shares in unlisted companies; (2) acquisi- tion of 10 percent or more of the shares of a listed company (including individual companies for which the stock price in over-the-counter transactions is made public by the Securities Dealers Association) by a single foreign investor; and (3) acquisition of loans of more than one-year maturity or securities privately placed in Japan, under certain circumstances. Any change of business objectives of a company with more than one- third foreign ownership is also subject to the provisions 318 for direct investment. Requests or orders for suspension or modification of specific aspects of the transaction may be made if the minister or ministers concerned consider the transaction to have adverse implications for national security, public order, public safety, the activities of Japanese enterprises in related lines of activities, the general performance of the economy, or for the mainte- nance of mutual equality of treatment of direct invest- ment with other countries. Acquisition of securities for portfolio through desig- nated securities firms can be freely made, but acquisition of such securities through securities firms other than the designated ones requires prior notice without a waiting period. Transactions requiring prior notice with a 20-day waiting period may be subject to suspension or modifi- cation by the Minister of Finance if, in his opinion, the transaction might adversely affect (1) domestic and international financial markets, (2) Japan's international reputation, (3) business activities of a sector of Japanese industries or the smooth performance of the national economy, and (4) implementation of Japan's interna- tional agreements, international peace and security, or the maintenance of public order. The Minister of Finance may shorten the notification period when the transaction under consideration is deemed unharmfu l. Other transac- tions by nonresidents may be generally carried out freely. Outward investments by residents in the form of loans, usance of not less than two years but exceeding one year, issue of yen-denominated bonds in Japan by nonresidents, and direct investment abroad are subject to prior notice with a 20-day waiting period. The criteria for suspension or modification of specific aspects of such transactions are as in the preceding paragraph. Foreign currency deposits overseas by residents and borrowing and lending in foreign currency between residents other than those carried out by an authorized bank in Japan require prior approval. Other external transactions by residents may normally be carried out freely. Foreign exchange banks are subject individually to controls over oversold or overbought positions in foreign currency. Foreign loans by banks are legally subject to prior notice with a waiting period, but in most cases they can be made upon notification. The banks are free to lend yen on a long-term basis overseas to borrowers of their choice, and they can accept foreign currency deposits from residents and nonresidents and make foreign currency loans to residents; foreign currency or yen deposits of nonresidents as well as residents are subject to m in imum reserve requirements adjusted from time to time by the Bank of Japan. Foreign banks are licensed to operate in Japan subject to Japanese banking regulations; they may obtain resources from inward remittances of foreign currency as well as from money markets in Japan. Gold Residents, including domestic producers of gold, may freely hold gold and purchase and sell it in domestic ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution transactions. The import and export of gold bullion is free from licensing, but transactions of not less than 100 kilograms require notification to a customs house. External futures trading in gold can be freely made by designated companies. Changes During 1985 Imports and Import Payments March 1. All tariffs on imports of semiconductor products into Japan were abolished in concert with similar action by the United States. April 1. With effect from April 1, 1985, the authori- ties announced advance tariff cuts (by two years) on imports from the developing countries of 33 agricultural, forestry, and fishery products, and 1,132 industrial and mining products; in the case of 40 other agricultural, forestry, and fishery products, the tariff cuts were advanced by one year. In addition, the 15 percent duty on certain types of bovine and equine leather was rescinded. April 9. A program aimed at opening Japanese markets to imports in the area of telecommunications, electronics, Pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, and forest products was announced. April 16. A quota of 2,000 tons for imports of apple juice during the first half of fiscal year 1985 was announced, twice as large as the annual quota specified in the External Economic Measures of April 27, 1984. July 30. A policy document entitled "Outline of Action Program for Improved Market Access" was released by the Japanese Government. The plan aimed, inter alia, at increasing imports through actions in four broad areas: (1) Standards and certification require- ments. These would be relaxed and streamlined so as to remove obstacles perceived by trade partners to their exports to Japan. Emphasis would be placed on introduc- ing and expanding self-certification, and accepting foreign test data for the certification process; foreign participation would be allowed in the drafting of stan- dards, and import certification procedures would be simplified. (2) Tariffs. The authorities announced their intention to reduce tariffs on industrial products to zero in the context of a new round of multilateral trade negotiations. In addition, tariffs on some 1,853 items were to be eliminated or reduced unilaterally as early as possible in 1986. Steps would also be taken to improve the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) for trade with developing countries, including reducing tariff rates, improving ceilings, expanding quotas, and con- sidering the equalization of the benefits of the GSP among the countries under the system. (3) Government procurement procedures. It was announced that contract procedures would be improved to increase the chances of fairer competition and further to facilitate market entry by foreign suppliers and others. (4) Import promotion. The authorities announced their intention to continue to request the business community to increase its purchases from abroad. JAPAN December 20. The authorities announced their inten- tion to remove restrictions on imports of refined petro- leum products. Exports and Export Proceeds March 14. Japan reached an agreement with the United States to limit Japanese steel exports to the United States during the period from October 1, 1984 to October 31, 1989 to less than 5.8 percent of the U .S. steel market. It was also agreed in the same context to limit Japanese exports of fabricated steel structures to the United States to 100,000 tons per year over the same period. March 31. The voluntary restraint arrangement on exports of Japanese cars to the United States expired without a renewal. The Japanese authorities, however, had announced their intention to limit voluntarily car exports to the United States to 2.3 million units over the period April 1985 to March 1986, an increase of 450,000 (or 24 percent) compared to the limit during the preceding year. April 9. As part of a program of trade liberalization, the authorities announced that they would continue their efforts to avoid concentrating specific exports in specific regions. December 31. The voluntary restraints on Japanese exports of videotape recorders (VTRs) to the EC expired. Payments for Invisibles July 30. As part of the "Outline of the Action Program for Improved Market Access," the authorities announced their readiness to discuss the relaxation of existing restrictions on services along with other countries in a new round of multilateral trade negotiations. In addition, specific liberalization measures would be taken, inter alia, in the transportation and insurance sectors. Capital January 10. The Ministry of Finance announced the elimination of the withholding tax of 20 percent on nonresident owned Euro-yen bonds issued in Japan. March 1. Money market certificates (MMC) were introduced. March 29. The Ministry of Finance granted authoriza- tion, with effect from June 1985, for banks and securities companies to offer revolving loan facilities (up to ¥ 2 million) by using public bonds as collateral. April 1. Medium- and long-term Euro-yen loans with a maturity of one year or more by nonresident lenders (including Japanese banks' overseas branches) to nonres- idents (including overseas subsidiaries of Japanese cor- porations) were liberalized. In addition, the withholding tax on nonresidents' earnings from Euro-yen bonds issued by Japanese residents was abolished, and qualifi- cation standards for the issues of Euro-yen bonds and yen-denominated bonds by nonresidents were further relaxed. 319 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution JAPAN June 1. A yen-denominated banker's acceptances market was established. June 17. It was confirmed that Floating Rate Notes (FRNs), Dual Currency Bonds, Currency Conversion Bonds, Deep Discount Bonds, and Zero Coupon Bonds issued by nonresidents would be allowed on the Euro- yen market. June 22. Authorization was granted for nine foreign banks to participate in trust banking business in Japan, thereby permitting them to participate in the manage- ment of corporate pension funds. July 1. The qualification standards for issues of Euro- yen convertible bonds by Japanese residents were relaxed. July 30. A policy document entitled "Outline of the Action Program for Improved Market Access" was released by the Japanese Government, spelling out the intended scope of financial market liberalization. In this context, the Japanese authorities undertook to relax and remove interest rate ceilings on large denomination deposits; to study the issue of liberalizing interest rate ceilings on small denomination deposits; and to take measures to develop further the Japanese short-term money markets, including liberalizing of interest rate ceilings on interbank deposits (as an aspect of the removal of interest rate ceilings on large denomination time deposits), and inviting market participants to review practices in the interbank market. (Transactions without collateral were also introduced to the call money market during the same month.) Efforts would be made to develop the money market in short-term government debt. Dealings in yen-denominated banker's acceptances would be permitted for securities companies from April 1986, to broaden the functioning of this market (hitherto serviced only by short-term credit dealers and bank- related companies). In addition, qualification standards for straight bonds without collateral would be modified, bullet repayment for 10- or 12-year bonds would be permitted, and the maturity range of corporate bonds would be diversified, while primary markets for yen- denominated foreign bonds and foreign currency denom- inated foreign bonds would be improved. The range of Euro-yen bonds issued by Japanese residents would also be diversified, and the issue of floating rate notes by residents would be liberalized in the spring of 1986. The program also foresaw that the maximum maturity of Euro-yen certificates of deposit (CDs) would be ex- tended to one year in the light of the relaxation of restrictions on domestic CDs. Other measures announced under the program related to the participation of foreign firms in the Japanese markets. Procedures were initiated for nine eligible foreign banks to begin to participate in trust banking activities in Japan, thus opening further the management of pension fund activity to foreign competition. In the same vein, and at the request of the Minister of Finance, the Tokyo Stock Exchange also decided to expand its membership. October 1. Interest rates on large time deposits of over ¥ 1 billion with a maturity of up to two years were liberalized. In addition, qualification standards for issues of Euro-yen bonds by Japanese residents were further relaxed. October 19. A bond futures market was established. December 24. The Tokyo Stock Exchange decided to grant membership to ten securities companies, including six foreign securities companies. (Such membership actually began on February 1, 1986.) 320 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution JORDAN (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Jordan is the Jordan Dinar, which is pegged to the SDR at JD 0.387754 = SDR 1. The middle rate of the Jordan dinar for the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, is determined by the Central Bank of Jordan on the basis of the daily calculations of the U .S. dollar-SDR rate. On December 31, 1985 the buying and selling rates of the Central Bank for the U.S. dollar were US$2.7307 and US$2.7078, respec- tively, per JD 1, and those for sterling were £ stg 1.8965 and £ stg. 1.8815, respectively, per JD 1. Buy ing and selling rates for other foreign currenciesl are fixed on the basis of the appropriate cross rates in international financial markets. A fee of 0.10 percent is levied on exchange permits approved by the Central Bank for sales of exchange for imports, except imports of government departments and certain other approved institutions. Forward exchange transactions in major currencies against the Jordan dinar are permitted in specified cases. For corporations or projects of vital national interest, the Central Bank may offer a forward exchange facility in respect of forward exchange cover by Jordanian banks. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Foreign Exchange Control Department of the Central Bank, which also issues exchange permits; the Central Bank has delegated to authorized banks the issuance of exchange permits for import payments and, within permitted annual limits, for payments for educational expenses of Jordanians studying abroad and for various other purposes. Import policy is determined by the Ministry of Industry and Trade in cooperation with the Ministries of Finance, Customs, Supply, and Agricul- ture. In addition, an Economic Security Committee is empowered to amend existing regulations or issue new ones concerning economic policy. Prescription of Currency Outward payments may be made in any currency. Proceeds from exports (except those of Jordanian goods to neighboring Arab countries or, excluding fruits and vegetables, up to JD 500 to other countries) and invisibles must be collected, and surrendered where required, in any convertible currency through an autho- rized bank in Jordan, or from a nonresident account with an authorized bank in Jordan. Nonresident Accounts Subject to the prior approval of the Central Bank, authorized banks may open nonresident accounts in Belgian francs, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. domestic currency; these accounts may be credited only with approved funds. The approval of the Central Bank is necessary for transfers from resident to nonresident accounts, but transfers between nonresident accounts are permitted freely. In addition, nonresidents, including Jordanians working abroad, may freely open interest- bearing foreign currency accounts with authorized banks. Balances on these accounts may be withdrawn freely in convertible currency, and the interest rate is fixed in accordance with rates prevailing in international markets. Jordanian nationals residing in Jordan may maintain foreign currency deposits with licensed banks in Jordan, provided that such deposit accounts are credited with foreign currencies from any source except the banking system and that the total of the deposits that any one person holds does not exceed the equivalent of JD 30,000. Jordanians who have worked abroad for more than three years and have decided to return may open accounts in foreign currencies without limits for a period of up to five years, after which the deposits in excess of the equivalent of JD 30,000 must be converted into Jordan dinars. Foreign Currency Accounts Deposit accounts denominated in foreign currency may be opened at the Central Bank by governmental and semigovernmental entities, as well as the specialized credit institutions, licensed finance companies, and domestic corporations of vital national interest (includ- ing those companies in which the Government owns more than 25 percent of the capital), provided that outstanding balances (including interest earnings) in each account do not exceed JD 1.0 million. This ceiling can be raised to JD 3.0 million in certain cases. Imports and Import Payments Imports of certain items2 from any source, and all imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. All other imports, unless covered by an agreement between Jordan and the exporting country ( i .e ., agricultural products from neighboring countries), require import licenses if their c. & f. value exceeds JD 100. These are granted freely by the Ministry of Industry and Trade and are subject to a fee of 4 percent of the c. & f. value payable on the issue of the import license. Imports that require an import license also require an exchange permit, which is granted automatically when an import license has been obtained; the importer holding an exchange permit may either open a letter of credit or pay against documents. A fee of 0.10 percent is 2These include carbonic acid; some nonalcoholic beverages; ciga- rettes; secondhand passenger cars and buses that are more than five years old; and military uniforms. Certain of these commodities may be imported, however, from Arab Common Market countries and from countries with which trade agreements are in force. Imports of certain agricultural commodities may be prohibited in good crop years. 321 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution JORDAN levied on exchange permits for imports, except those made by government departments and certain approved institutions and individual permits of less than JD 500. The use of suppliers' credits is subject to prior approval by the Central Bank, which normally is given for essential imports only. In addition to import duties, a surcharge of 13 percent of the duty-paid value is levied on most imports to finance social welfare and the development of certain public facilities. Imports to Free Zones With the discontinuance of Central Bank issuance of exchange permits for imports to free zones and for transit trade, it is the importer's responsibility to provide foreign currencies to finance such transactions. Payments for Invisibles Remittances by postal order do not require exchange control approval, provided that they do not exceed JD 10 a person a month (JD 100 a person a month for Kuwait and Jordanian students in Yugoslavia, JD 50 for the United Kingdom, and US$125 for Algeria). Payments for the following types of invisibles are generally permitted within certain limits: remittances to residents' dependents; reasonable living expenses of Jordanian nationals abroad; expenses of Jordanian residents travel- ing abroad; educational expenses; expenses for medical treatment; business expenses abroad; and insurance payments in accordance with special regulations.3 A fee of 0.10 percent is levied on exchange permits for invisible payments except those of government departments and certain approved institutions, permits financed from nonresident accounts in foreign currency, and those with a value under JD 500. No limit exists on the remittance of income accrued to nonresidents or savings of foreign nationals who intend to return to their own countries. The exchange allowance for business and tourist travel is the equivalent of JD 5,000 a person (JD 500 for children under 18). These allowances are granted an- nually for one or more trips. For family support, an annual allowance of JD 5,000 for each beneficiary is permitted; however, remittances by postal order may be made for amounts not exceeding the equivalent of JD 10 a month to any one person resident abroad (JD 100 a month for Kuwait and Jordanian students in Yugoslavia, JD 50 for the United Kingdom, and US$125 for Algeria), and are not subject to this ceiling. The policy in respect of payments for invisibles is, in general, liberal and nondiscriminatory. In practice, the Central Bank does not restrict remittances of income accruing to nonresidents or of savings of foreign nationals returning to their own countries. In addition to any travel allocation, residents and nonresidents traveling abroad may take out up to JD 300 in Jordanian notes and coin and any amount in foreign notes and coin, provided these are for their own use. Nonresidents working in Jordan can transfer 70 percent of their salaries if they maintain a nonresident Jordanian dinar account; if they do not have such accounts, they can transfer up to JD 100 monthly with a total amount not exceeding JD 1,200 annually. Furthermore, all travelers may take out checks, traveler's checks, or letters of credit issued by authorized banks in Jordan, in accordance with exchange permits authorized by the Central Bank. Tourists and other nonresidents may also take out foreign currency notes and coin and any other foreign means of payment that they had previously brought in and declared to the customs authorities at the time of entry. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Export proceeds must be collected and the foreign exchange surrendered within six months of shipment. Exempt from this requirement are the proceeds from exports of Jordanian products to neighboring Arab countries, and proceeds of up to JD 500 from exports (excluding fruits and vegetables) to other countries. Exporters and residents of Jordan are not permitted to maintain bank balances abroad for any purpose. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange receipts from invisibles must be surrendered to an authorized bank or, if bank notes and traveler's checks are received, to an authorized bank or to an authorized exchange dealer. Travelers entering Jordan may bring in any amount in Jordanian and foreign notes and coin.4 Any person regarded for exchange control purposes as resident in Jordan may be required by the Central Bank to surrender to an authorized bank any foreign currency at his disposal. Capital Capital may be imported freely, but exports of capital require approval and are not normally allowed, except that the Central Bank is prepared to examine applications by banks, insurance companies, industrial or trading firms, and contractors for permission to transfer funds abroad for specified investment or operating purposes. Current income resulting from nonresident investments in Jordan may be transferred abroad. Under the Law for the Encouragement of Investment, profits from approved foreign investments may be remitted, without limitation, in any convertible currency. After two years, repatriation of the capital is permitted in three equal annual install- ments in any convertible currency. The Investment Committee may approve more liberal provisions, and exchange permits are granted accordingly. The Compa- nies Registration Law No. 46 of 1975 provides various benefits for foreign companies establishing branches in 3All insurance must be taken out in Jordan, but foreign exchange is granted for premiums in respect of insurance contracts concluded prior to May 1965. 4Approval is not given for the crediting of such Jordanian currency to a nonresident account or for the remittance abroad of the equivalent in foreign currency. 322 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution JORDAN Jordan for the purpose of conducting business outside the country; such branches may also be granted nonresident status for exchange control purposes. Premium Devel- opment Bonds denominated in Jordan dinars may be purchased with convertible currencies by nonresidents; maturity proceeds, premiums, and interest are transfer- able in any convertible currency. Gold The Central Bank has issued ten gold coins. These coins, although legal tender, do not circulate and are available only to nonresidents and domestic numisma- tists. Residents may purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in Jordan for numismatic or investment purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authori- ties and authorized industrial users are not, in principle, allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Licenses for imports of gold in any form other than jewelry are issued by the Ministry of Industry and Trade on the recommendation of the Central Bank, while exports of gold in any form require a license from the Central Bank. Changes During 1985 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 323 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution KENYA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Kenya is the Kenya Shilling, which is pegged to the SDR within margins of 2.25 percent. The middle rate of the Kenya shilling for the U .S. dollar quoted by the Central Bank is determined on the basis of the daily U .S. dollar-SDR rate. The Central Bank's buying and selling rates are each set at 0.15 percent below and above the rate thus determined. On Decem- ber 31, 1985 buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were K Sh 16.2598 and K Sh 16.3087, respectively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates for certain other currenciesl are determined on the basis of appropriate New York closing rates. The Central Bank does not deal in other foreign currencies, except occasionally on behalf of the Government. The Central Bank deals up to six months forward with commercial banks in pounds sterling, U .S. dollars, and deutsche mark to cover their contracts with exporters and importers; commercial banks may cover their forward exchange contracts in outside markets in other foreign currencies against U .S. dollars or pounds sterling. Administration of Control The Minister of Finance has delegated the administra- tion of exchange control to the Central Bank. Authority is delegated to the authorized banks for approving certain payments for imports, many payments for current invis- ibles, and some capital payments. Import controls are administered by the Director of Internal Trade in the Ministry of Commerce and Indus- try. The responsibility for issuing import licenses rests with the Director, to whom applications must be sub- mitted by the importer in Kenya before orders are placed abroad. Applications for the allocation of foreign ex- change for imports are forwarded by the Director to the Central Bank. The quota system is administered by the Import Management Committee (IMC), and the Official Import Committee (OIC) deals with policy issues on imports. Both of these committees are composed of representatives from the Ministries of Finance, Planning and National Development, Commerce and Industry, and the Central Bank. The Director of External Trade in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry deals with export promotion and issues special licenses for the export of restricted goods such as maize and other food products. Most other goods may be exported with special licenses. 'Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Burundi francs, Canadian dollars, deutsche mark, Ethiopian birr, French francs, Indian rupees, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Rwanda francs, Swaziland emalangeni, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, Tanzania shillings, Ugandan shillings, and Zambian kwacha. 324 Prescription of Currency Payments to residents of countries other than South Africa may be made in Kenya shillings to the credit of an External Account in Kenya or in any foreign currency. Receipts may be obtained in Kenya shillings from an External Account in Kenya or in any marketable foreign currency. Remittances to South Africa are prohibited, with the exception of pensions payable by the Govern- ment of Kenya. Nonresident Accounts Accounts in Kenya shillings held by residents of countries other than South Africa with authorized banks in Kenya are, with exchange control approval, desig- nated External Accounts. They may be credited freely with authorized payments to such countries by residents of Kenya, with transfers from other External Accounts, and with the proceeds from sales of any currency (other than South African currency) and gold by nonresidents to authorized dealers. External Accounts may be debited freely for payments to residents and nonresidents. Nontransferable funds of nonresidents are credited to Blocked Accounts. Subject to prescribed procedures, balances on Blocked Accounts (other than those in the beneficial ownership of residents of South Africa) may be used for approved domestic expenditures and for the purchase in Kenya of specified bonds issued by the Government or by local authorities and officially quoted in Kenya .2 The redemption proceeds of these securities are transferable, and interest is freely transferable to nonresidents as and when it accrues. Imports and Import Payments All imports from South Africa are prohibited. All imports are classified into four schedules: Schedules IA, IB, HAS, and IIB, and are subject to import licensing. All private sector imports require a license for the allocation of foreign exchange, issued jointly by the Director of Internal Trade and the Central Bank. Appli- cations must be approved before firm orders are placed. Schedule I consists of a list of high-priority items, including a subschedule IA of items for which licenses are approved by the Director of Internal Trade, and foreign exchange is allocated by the Central Bank; the approval of licenses is in principle automatic, though approval may sometimes be withheld in cases where overstocking is thought to be taking place. Quotas are applied to items under subschedule IIB. Sub- schedule HAS includes high-priority (mainly petroleum, cereals and fertilizer) items whose importation requires authorization by a state agency; and subschedule IIB contains items that are domestically produced or whose 2Such securities must be payable in Kenya shillings and they must not be redeemable earlier than five years from the date of acquisition. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution substitutes are available from domestic industry, and consumer goods. Importation of items in sub- schedules HAS and IIB is limited to importers who have been granted foreign exchange quotas. Quotas for schedule IIA are set so as to satisfy expected demand, and import licenses up to the quotas are given auto- matically. The importers' quotas for schedule IIB, on the other hand, are item-specific. Applications for foreign exchange allocation licenses for imports are subject to a charge of 1 percent of the cost and freight value of the application. When an exchange allocation license has been ob- tained from the Central Bank or when such a license is not required, authorized banks are permitted to provide exchange against documents, but normally not prior to customs entry. Prior exchange control approval must be obtained for imports of capital goods on deferred payment terms, and for imports of machinery and equipment, which are regarded as a contribution toward capital or are to be accounted for on a loan basis. With the exception of imports from Tanzania, Uganda, and some other countries, most imports with an f.o.b. value in excess of K Sh 40,000 are subject to preshipment inspection as to quality, quantity, and price by the Societe Generate de Surveillance (SGS) of Geneva acting for the Central Bank. A "Clean Report of Findings" must be obtained before shipment, and autho- rized banks in Kenya may not issue shipping guarantees for the clearance of imports until this "Clean Report" has been received. All goods purchased by importers in Kenya must be insured with companies licensed to transact insurance business in Kenya. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles are controlled. Authorized banks are empowered to approve specified categories of current payments without limitation or up to established limits. Amounts above these limits as well as other current payments may be approved administratively, and most current payments are in practice unrestricted. Fees for education up to the equivalent of K Sh 24,000 a person for a full scholastic year3 and fees for other specified purposes may be approved by an authorized bank upon presentation of evidence of debt. The Central Bank may approve higher remittances for education expenses. Foreign nationals who work in Kenya as employed persons (as well as certain categories of the self-employed, such as doctors and dentists) and have not been in the country for more than four years may remit abroad as savings up to one third of their monthly salaries but not more than K Sh 4,000 a month; in addition, they may remit funds to cover maintenance, educational expenses, etc., provided that their total remittances including savings do not exceed one half of their monthly salaries. Expatriates who have stayed for 3Authorized dealers are not allowed to remit any funds for educational support to students at primary or secondary schools who were not abroad in the 1975-76 academic year. KENYA over four years may continue to remit from salaries as above, up to the end of the tenth year of their residence in Kenya, but in that case they are not entitled to transfer additional savings upon emigration within that period. Remittances to South Africa, other than certain pen- sions, are prohibited. Nonresident individual property owners may remit up to K Sh 20,000 of net rental income in each 12-month period. Any excess of net rent over the permitted transfer is placed in a Blocked Account and may be invested in approved securities with at least five years to maturity, after which period the redemption proceeds may be remitted to the nonresident beneficiary. Real estate companies deriving income solely from rent are per- mitted to transfer annually up to 10 percent of the book value of their properties as at September 25, 1970, or an amount not exceeding 10 percent of issued capital. Where income is derived from rent as well as other sources, applications must be made to the exchange control authorities for approval of remittance of such incomes. Exchange control approval is required for outward remittance of profits and dividends on nonresi- dent equity holdings. The basic allowance for travel by adults holding round-trip tickets is K Sh 4,000 a person (K Sh 2,000 for children between 3 and 12 years of age) every two years. Holders of one-way tickets who have been granted emigration status or final departure rights are not entitled to the basic travel allowance but to an allowance of K Sh 2,000 a person. The basic allowance is not available for travel to South Africa. Commercial banks may sell foreign exchange for business travel to Tan- zania and Uganda up to K Sh 400 a night for a maximum period of ten days at a time. Business travelers to other countries are granted an allowance of up to K Sh 1,500 a day for a maximum period of 20 days. There is a once- only hajj pilgrimage allowance of K Sh 12,000 for adults, which is available only to persons who have not utilized the basic travel allowance within the preceding two years. Nonresident travelers may take out freely any unutilized balance of foreign currency notes they brought in upon entry. Residents of Kenya traveling abroad on international flights and holding return tickets may carry up to K Sh 100 with them for local expenses on return, but otherwise the export of Kenya bank notes is prohibited. Temporarily, all sales of tickets to Kenyan residents for nongovernmental travel outside Kenya are subject to exchange control approval. Applications for travel tickets must be accompanied by a deposit of 10 percent of the value of the air ticket and 5 percent of the sea ticket, returnable only if the applications are not approved. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. All regular and proven exporters are registered with the Central Bank. Exports of certain foodstuffs and agricultural products require special licenses and may be subject to restriction to ensure adequate supplies in the domestic 325 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution KENYA market. Exports of tea, coffee, minerals, precious stones, and other essential strategic materials are also subject to special licensing. Most other goods may be exported without special licenses other than exchange control approval. Coffee is marketed through the Coffee Board of Kenya. Export proceeds in foreign currencies must be collected within three months of exportation and offered to an authorized dealer in Kenya for conversion into Kenya shillings. Exports of manufactured goods with at least 30 percent domestic value added are eligible for compensation equivalent to 20 percent of the f .o .b. value. All exports other than coffee, tea, sugar, sisal, pyrethrum, horticultural products, petroleum products, soda ash, and most goods produced with raw material inputs not subject to import duty are covered by the export compensation scheme. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in foreign currencies must be sold to an authorized bank. Nonresidents must settle hotel bills in foreign currency or against an External Account. Travelers may bring in freely foreign currency notes, except those of countries with restrictions on exportation of their currencies. The import of domestic bank notes is prohibited, except that residents returning to Kenya may bring in up to K Sh 100 previously taken out by themselves. Capital Capital transfers to all countries are restricted. Trans- fers to South Africa are prohibited. With the exception of expatriate employees who have opted for remittance of savings from salaries, an emigrant is allowed to transfer up to K Sh 300,000 a family unit from his declared assets as a settling-in allowance to the new country of resi- dence. Of this sum, K Sh 100,000 is made available for immediate remittance, and the remainder will be autho- rized for remittance in not more than five annual installments not exceeding the equivalent of K Sh 40,000 each year. The initial settling-in allowance of K Sh 100,000 lapses if it is not remitted within the first two years of the emigrant's departure from Kenya. All remaining funds must be credited to a Blocked Account; they may then be invested in approved securities, and redemption proceeds become transferable, provided that redemption does not take place earlier than five years from the date of purchase. If assets in Kenya are valued at K Sh 1 million or more, they must be liquidated before any exchange control approvals are sought and the proceeds must be invested in prescribed securities. The investment of foreign funds in Kenya is not generally restricted, but to ensure eventual repatriation it is necessary to obtain from the Treasury a "certificate of approved enterprise" for the investment. Foreign and domestic investment in specified types of production requires approval. Local borrowing by nonresident- 326 owned or nonresident-controlled companies, as well as borrowing by residents from nonresidents, requires exchange control approval and is restricted. All imports and exports of securities require approval. Approval is granted for the purchase by nonresidents of Kenyan securities on a recognized stock exchange, provided that payment is received in an appropriate manner. The income from such securities is remittable, but the proceeds on resale must normally be credited to a Blocked Account unless they are reinvested. Residents are not normally permitted to purchase foreign securities. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Kenya for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial and professional users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Exports of gold in any form other than jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler require exchange control approval. Import licenses for gold bullion (ingots, bars, or sheets) are issued restrictively and only to goldsmiths, and imports of gold coin are not being licensed. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement March 29. The central exchange rate of the Kenya shilling against the SDR was adjusted from K Sh 15.1872 = SDR 1 to K Sh 15.8967 = SDR 1, representing a devaluation of 4.46 percent. (The rate was adjusted on two other occasions during the year: to K Sh 16.148906 = SDR 1 on June 28, 1985, and to K Sh 17.737761 = SDR 1 on August 16, 1985, making a cumulative devaluation of the central rate of 14.38 per- cent during 1985.) Imports and Import Payments June 13. Changes were made in the import system, as follows: (a) it was announced that 306 items would be moved from import licensing subschedule IB to IA, and 11 items from subschedule IIB to IA. As a result, subschedule IA accounted for 43 percent of all items; subschedule IB, 23 percent; subschedule HAS, 3 per- cent; and subschedule IIB, 31 percent; (b) it was announced that import tariffs would be reduced by an average of 12 percent on a range of items such as raw materials, intermediate industrial inputs, and capital goods that were dutiable at rates in excess of 25 percent; and (c) following authorization of local assembly of passenger cars, it was announced that the import tariff on passenger cars in complete form would be set at a uniform rate of 50 percent irrespective of engine rating, while the tariff on unassembled cars would be reduced from 35 percent to 25 percent. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution KOREA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Korea is the Korean Won, which is linked to a multicurrency basket (consisting of a trade- weighted basket and the SDR basket), but other factors are also taken into account if necessary. The Bank of Korea establishes daily the exchange rate of the won in terms of the U .S. dollar, which is the intervention currency. On December 31, 1985 the buying and selling rates of the Bank of Korea for the U .S. dollar were W 888.40 and W 892.00, respectively, per US$1, and the telegraphic transfer buying and selling rates of the foreign exchange banks were W 887.90 and W 892.50, respectively, per US$1. The buying and selling rates for certain other currencies are posted daily by foreign exchange banks on the basis of buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar in markets abroad. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Foreign exchange banks may conduct forward transac- tions not only in foreign currencies but also between the Korean won and foreign currencies. There are no specific restrictions on the terms of forward contracting in respect of interbank transactions. In forward contracts between the Korean won and foreign currencies, the terms of forward contracts between a foreign exchange bank and a nonbank customer cannot exceed one year. In addition, a forward contract between a foreign exchange bank and a nonbank resident customer must be related to a bona fide transaction and the contract amount must not exceed the expected receipt or payment on the transaction. Administration of Control The Ministry of Finance initiates policy with respect to prescription of currency and method of settlement, foreign exchange operations, payments for nonmerchan- dise transactions, and capital transactions and transfers. It also prepares and administers the Foreign Exchange Supply and Demand Plan, which sets overall ceilings on the amounts of foreign exchange that may be used. The Bank of Korea, as the Government's agent, executes most of the above functions; it also regulates operations in the exchange market and is authorized to intervene in it. The Bank has been delegated authority to control payments related to invisibles and certain capital transac- tions. The foreign exchange banks, as well as the branch offices in Korea of foreign banks, are authorized to engage in commercial international banking and in all foreign exchange dealings, with the exception of those specifically prohibited. The trade program for imports financed from Korea's own foreign exchange resources (KFX) is prepared by the Ministry of Commerpe and Industry. Imports financed by foreign loans are drawn up separately by the Ministry of Finance in consultation with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Import licenses are issued by the foreign exchange banks. Prescription of Currency All settlements between Korea and other countries are made in convertible currencies. The proceeds of exports must be obtained in prescribed currencies.1 Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents, including Korean workers abroad, may maintain foreign currency deposit accounts with foreign exchange banks. Remittances from such accounts and withdrawals in the form of currency notes upon depar- ture from Korea may, in general, be made freely. The approval of the bank where the account is held is not required for remittances abroad or transfer to other foreign currency accounts, for withdrawals of foreign means of payment and purchases of other foreign means of payment, or for sales to a foreign exchange bank in exchange for domestic means of payment or payments for approved transactions. The deposit may be disposed of by sale to a foreign exchange bank at the prevailing exchange rate and may be debited for salaries paid to foreign employees. All residents are allowed to open foreign currency deposit accounts. The holders of these accounts may change the currency composition of these accounts as they wish. Imports and Import Payments All imports require licenses; for certain imports (see below), licenses are issued upon application. Imports are divided into two categories: those paid for with Korean foreign exchange (KFX imports) and those paid for with foreign loan funds. KFX imports are classified as automatic approval or restricted items. All commodities may be imported freely (i.e., applications for import licenses are automatically approved), unless they are on a list of restricted items, subject to the general limits set by the Foreign Exchange Supply and Demand Plan. On December 31, 1985, out of 7,915 basic items in the Cus- toms Cooperation Council Nomenclature (CCCN), 970 were classified as restricted items. Imports of raw mate- rials for the production of exports are normally approved automatically, irrespective of their classification. Import licenses are granted only to registered traders; to maintain the status of a registered trader, ordinary exporters are required to export a minimum value of US$0.5 million each year. The commercial terms of payment on which imports may be contracted are regulated. The requirement for ' In addition to the Hong Kong dollar and the Swiss franc, the list of prescribed currencies comprises the currencies of the member countries of the Fund that have accepted the obligations of Article VIII of the Fund's Articles of Agreement. 327 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution KOREA advance import deposits ranging from 5 percent to 20 percent for goods imported by the private sector on a deferred payment basis has been suspended with the reduction of the percentage to zero beginning in Febru- ary 1982. The customs tariff is a "flexible" tariff. Furthermore, the Government may alter import duty rates administra- tively by up to 40 percent points. The Government also has authority to impose import surcharges of up to 30 percent on all dutiable imports, but by the end of 1985 it had not invoked this authority. A defense surcharge of 2.5 percent ad valorem is levied on most imported goods. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require individual licenses. Payments for invisibles connected with foreign trade and for certain other items such as banking charges, insurance premiums, communication fees, and periodicals are licensed automatically. In addition, Ko- rean companies are authorized to use foreign exchange for the expenses of their overseas branches. Residents traveling abroad may purchase foreign exchange up to the equivalent of US$3,000 each trip as the basic travel allowance plus US$200 a day (if the period of travel is in excess of 10 days), or up to US$2,000 as a monthly allowance for living expenses (if the period of travel is in excess of 60 days), and may also purchase additional foreign exchange for extra expenses. The basic monthly allowance for students living abroad is US$1,000 per individual and US$1,500 per family; the travel allowance for Koreans working abroad is US$1,000 a person. Korean currency notes in excess of W 500,000 and foreign currency notes may not be exported without special permission. Nonresidents must register the foreign exchange that they bring into Korea if the amount exceeds the equivalent of US$5,000. Upon leaving the country, foreign residents and tourists may acquire foreign exchange up to the amount for which they have proof of exchange. Exports and Export Proceeds Certain exports on a restricted list require individual licenses. All other exports may be made freely under an automatic approval procedure. Foreign exchange pro- ceeds from exports must either be surrendered to a foreign exchange bank at its posted customer rate or be deposited in foreign exchange accounts in banks. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds derived from invisibles must either be sold to a foreign exchange bank for won or be deposited in foreign exchange accounts in the banks. Travelers may bring with them any amount of foreign exchange, but the import by travelers of Korean currency in excess of W 500,000 is restricted. The proceeds received by construction companies from construction activity abroad must be deposited in foreign currency accounts, and the conversion of these 328 deposits is subject to approval by a foreign exchange bank for ascertaining the bona fides of the transactions; approval is given virtually automatically. Capital All outward remittances of capital require approval. Foreign capital investment, loans from abroad, and imports of capital goods on a long-term basis can secure a guarantee of repayment and repatriation under the Foreign Capital Inducement Act. No limits are placed on the conversion and remittance of legitimate profits and dividends, or on the repatriation of the originally invested capital. No prior approval is required to hold abroad retained profits not exceeding US$10,000 from Korean direct investment overseas. Under the Foreign Capital Inducement Act, authorization is required for borrowing abroad of more than US$1 million with maturities in excess of three years; for borrowings under US$1 million repayable within three years, authorization is required under the Foreign Exchange Control Act. Subject to the relevant ceiling, foreign bank branches in Korea can enter into swap transactions with the Bank of Korea to secure funds for their domestic currency lending. Foreign exchange allowance for emigrants is subject to a limit of US$100,000 for each household. Foreign exchange banks may grant authorization for such remittances up to US$20,000; for remittances over US$20,000 authorization from the Bank of Korea is required. There is a list of industries in which investment is reserved for Koreans; as of December 31, 1985 foreign investment is permitted in 762 out of 999 industries. For foreign investment in other industries, automatic ap- proval is granted in principle if equity participation is less than 50 percent or US$1 million for a single project; participation in excess of 50 percent is approved after consultation among related ministries. Foreign equity participation of up to 100 percent is permissible under the Act. Gold Certain commemorative gold coins are legal tender but do not circulate. Residents may freely buy, hold, and sell gold in any form in Korea. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler require licenses issued by the Bank of Korea or a foreign exchange bank; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users. The import of gold for industrial or medical purposes requires approval by a foreign exchange bank. Domestically produced gold may be disposed of in the free market. The free market price at public gold auctions was about W 10,600 a gram at the end of 1985. Changes During 1985 Imports and Import Payments July 1. Changes were made in the import system as follows: (a) importation of 235 different items was ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution liberalized, while 2 specified items were removed from the free to the restricted import list (the ratio of liberalized to total imports was consequently raised from 84.8 percent to 87.7 percent); (b) the number of automatically approved import items was raised from 6,712 to 6,945, out of a total list (CCCN) of 7,915 items; (c) a list of 603 items scheduled to be liberalized during the period 1986-88 was announced; and (d) higher elastic tariffs were introduced for 4 of the 235 newly liberalized import items (copper bars, copper tubes, electric power cables, and talcum powder), while 9 items were removed from the elastic tariff rate list, leaving 13 items on the list up to the end of 1985, consisting of 7 items on the list of adjustment tariff rates and 6 items subject to emergency tariffs. Payments for Invisibles March 4. The basic travel allowance for Koreans going abroad to study was reduced from US$3,000 to US$2,000 a person, and the monthly allowance, from US$2,000 to US$1,500 a family. Capital March 7. In a move to ease the discriminatory restrictions on the operations of foreign bank branches and to strengthen the competitiveness of domestic banking institutions, foreign bank branches were given access to the rediscount facility for export financing at the Bank of Korea on the same terms as domestic banks. It was also announced that use of swap arrangements as the principal means of local currency funding by the foreign banks would be scaled down gradually and that for 1985, the ceiling would be reduced by 50 percent of the total local currency raised through the Bank of Korea's rediscount facility. In addition, with immediate effect, the margin requirement on swap transactions with foreign bank branches was reduced from 1 percent to 0.75 percent, and these branches were placed on the same basis as domestic banks in being made subject to the requirement that at least 25 percent of loan increment be extended to small and medium firms. KOREA March 29. The value limit on investment trusts through which foreign residents could indirectly invest in Korean bonds and equity was raised by US$30 million. (Increases of the same amount were made on April 19 and April 30, 1985, raising the limit to US$200 million.) October 14. Authorization was granted for foreign participation in 102 of the 339 previously restricted industrial areas, increasing the number of industrial sectors accessible to foreign investors from 660 to 762, and raising the liberalization ratio for capital from 66.1 percent to 76.3 percent of total. Among the 102 newly liberalized activities were those relating to soft drinks, oil and fa t, synthetic fiber, cosmetics, wholesale and retail trade, and baked foods. In addition, authoriza- tion was granted for foreign banks to engage in trust bus- iness on the same conditions as domestic banks, and to use the central clearing house, as a means of permitting more efficient processing of bills of exchange. November 12. Authorization was granted for eligible firms to issue abroad convertible bonds and depository receipts in amounts up to 15 percent of their current market capitalization; holdings of such financial instru- ments by each foreign investor were limited to 3 percent of the issuing company's paid-in capital. To become eligible, an issuing firm should have net assets of at least W 50 billion, and the prices of its shares should be above the weighted average share price of companies on the Korean stock exchange. In addition, for depository receipts, the issuing company should have had average earnings per share of at least 20 percent during the two preceding fiscal years; in the case of nonguaranteed convertible bonds, the company should satisfy specified domestic or internationally accepted credit rating stan- dards. Financial obligations arising within this frame- work could be converted into equity after 18 months from the date of issue, although the conversion period could be lengthened by the President of the Korean Securities and Exchange Commission if direct foreign investment in the Korean capital market was not yet permitted by the eligible conversion date. 329 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution KUWAIT (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Kuwa it is the Kuwa i ti Dinar. The exchange value of the Kuwa i ti dinar is determined on the basis of the fixed but adjustable relationship between the Kuwaiti dinar and a weighted basket of currencies that takes into account Kuwa i t 's trade and financial relations with other countries. Following a period between April and August 1984 when two exchange rates (a "declared rate" for documented commercial transactions, and a more depreciated "financial rate" for capital and specified current transactions) were applied, a unitary exchange rate was in place by the end of August 1984. For exchange transactions with local banks in the intervention currency, the U .S. dollar, the Central Bank of Kuwait normally sets margins of 0.0625 percent on either side of the middle rate. The Central Bank sets the rate for the U .S. dollar each day on the basis of the latest available market quotations for that currency in relation to the other currencies included in the basket. On December 31, 1985 the buy ing and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were KD 0.2883 and KD 0.28919, respec- tively, per US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. On April 5, 1963 Kuwa it formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control There is no exchange control, and residents and nonresidents may freely purchase and sell foreign cur- rencies in Kuwa i t. Dealings in the currencies of Israel and South Africa are prohibited.l General and individual import licenses are issued by the Ministry of Finance and Economy. A limited control over exports is administered by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Customs and Ports Administration. Prescription of Currency There are no prescription of currency requirements. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents may freely open accounts in Kuwa i ti dinars and foreign currencies. The use of such accounts is not restricted. Imports and Import Payments Import licenses are required for all commercial im- ports other than fresh fruit and vegetables; licenses, except for wheat, flour, and asbestos pipes, are issued freely to registered Kuwaiti merchants and companies. Registered importers handling a variety of commodities 'in addition, all imports from these countries and all exports to them are prohibited; payments may not be made to them or be received from them for any type of transaction. 330 may obtain a general license valid for one year. Other importers must obtain specific licenses for individual commodities, which also are valid for one year. Imports of industrial equipment, machinery, and their spare parts require industrial licenses, valid for one-time use. Licenses are issued to registered and licensed industrial establishments after the approval of the Industrial Devel- opment Commission at the Ministry of Oil and Industry. Private imports of personal objects may be permitted under individual or specific licenses. Importation of certain items (mainly oxygen, certain steel and asbestos pipes, pork or foodstuffs containing pork, alcoholic beverages, and used vehicles over five years old) is prohibited. Commercial imports are limited to registered import- ers. To be registered, the importer must be either a Kuwa i ti citizen or a firm in wh ich all partners are Kuwa i ti nationals, or a shareholding or limited liability company in which Kuwa i ti nationals own at least 51 percent of the stock. Imports from any permitted source may be paid for freely. During 1985, customs tariffs continued to be used for the protection of domestically produced goods; in this context, a customs duty of 15 percent is imposed on imports of lead batteries and one of 30 percent on imports of chemical detergents and polypropylene and polyethylene films that are considered similar to those produced domestically, and a maximum customs du ty of 100 percent is imposed on a few commodities competing w i th locally manufactured goods. As a general rule, protection is accorded to a firm only if the value added is in excess of 40 percent. Imports are subject to customs du ty at a m in imum rate of 4 percent. Imports of foodstuffs are exempt from import duties. Beginning from September 1, 1983, and in concert with other member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) (Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates), import duties in Kuwa it have been stabilized at the prevailing rate of 4 percent. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of live sheep and poultry and of certain other items (such as sugar, fats, rice, meat, eggs, milk, cheese, butter, olive oil, fresh fru i ts, vegetables in any form, beans, lentils, chick-peas, jams, and cement) may be prohibited in time of emergency or shortage in Kuwa i t. These items may be exported in limited quan- tities only, under a special license issued by the Ministry of Finance and Economy. Exports of arms and ammu- nition require licenses. Licenses are not required for other exports or re-exports. There are no requirements attached to receipts from exports or re-exports; the proceeds need not be repatriated or surrendered, and they may be disposed of freely, regardless of the currency involved. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles All payments for current invisibles may be made freely. Travelers may bring in or take out any amount in Kuwaiti or other bank notes. Capital There are no exchange control restraints on the transfer to Kuwait of resident or nonresident capital in any currency. Government agreement is necessary for the participation of nonresident capital in corporations in Kuwait; at least 51 percent of ownership of new Kuwaiti companies must be held by nationals. Beginning from 1983, the participation of the nationals of countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council in companies established in Kuwait may reach up to 75 percent of the capital. No restrictions are imposed on outward capital payments by residents or nonresidents. Dealings in domestic or foreign stocks in the official Kuwait Stock Exchange are subject to the approval of the Exchange Committee. Besides the approved domestic stocks, trading is per- mitted in certain stocks of companies of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, but dealings are re- stricted to Kuwaiti citizens. The listing of Kuwaiti dinar- denominated bonds in the Exchange is subject to the approval of the Exchange Committee. At the end of 1985, 26 Kuwaiti dinar bonds were listed, and foreigners were permitted to sell and buy these bonds in the Exchange. Gold The monetary authorities and merchants registered with the Ministry of Finance and Economy may import and export gold in any form, provided that such gold is not less than 18-karat fine; gold jewelry may not be imported or sold unless it is properly hallmarked. Kuwaiti nationals may freely, and without license, purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad. Other residents may, on arrival or departure, carry their holdings of gold in any form, without restriction or license. Jewelry and precious metals in any form, manufactured or unmanufactured, are subject to an import duty of 4 percent. Changes During 1985 Imports and Import Payments April 3. Customs duty was introduced as follows on imports of specified products considered to be similar to KUWAIT those produced domestically: lead batteries, 15 percent; chemical detergents (in powder form), 30 percent; and polypropylene and polyethylene films, 30 percent. June 11. Lubricating oils imported from Gulf Cooper- ation Council (GCC) member countries were exempted from the 30 percent customs duty. June 17. Customs duty levied for the protection of domestically produced goods were extended for another year on imports of liquid paints, liquid shampoo and chemical detergents, deodorants, and plastic manufactures. July 28. A customs du ty of 30 percent was levied on imports of alkide, polyester, polyester finylsitat plastic materials, and poly vinyl acetate. August 12. A general rule was introduced under which tariff protection would be authorized only for firms with value added in excess of 40 percent. To this end, a technical committee was established to determine the value added by industrial production units. September 23. As a protective measure to apply for three years, customs duty was introduced on imports of the following products: mineral waters, 20 percent; sanitary towels and napkins, 15 percent; paper manufac- tures (roofing paper, floating paper, kraft paper, kraft liner, sanitary paper used in toilet paper, and paper tissues), 25 percent; lime powder and sheets, 25 percent; specified kinds of cement, 15 percent; glass-wool for insulation purposes, 25 percent. October 19. The prohibition on imports of welded black steel pipes (6-48 inches in diameter) was extended for another two years. December 22.

Not for Redistribution LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Lao People's Democratic Re- public is the Kip (KN), which was introduced by decree on December 10, 1979 to replace the Kip of Liberation at KN 1 = KL 100. On December 31, 1985 the official exchange rate for the U.S. dollar quoted by the State Bank of the Lao People's Democratic Republic (the central bank) was KN 10 = US$1; this rate is used only for customs valuation and certain other accounting purposes. Foreign exchange transactions are effected at a premium exchange rate of KN 35 per US$1, with the following exceptions: the Lao Bank for Foreign Trade applies preferential exchange rates for private inward remittances by Lao nationals (KN 270 per US$1) and for purchases of foreign exchange from tourists and non-Lao residents (KN 108 per US$1); in addition, limited quantities of foreign exchange are sold at the rate of KN 300 per US$1 to private importers participating in a joint cooperative venture with the municipality of Vien- tiane. Buying and selling rates for certain other curren- cies1 are also officially quoted, based on the exchange rate of KN 35 per US$1. Administration of Control The Lao Bank for Foreign Trade, a subsidiary of the central bank, handles all official foreign exchange transactions related to foreign trade and services. All other official transactions are handled by the National Bank, which also administers exchange controls. Most foreign trade has been nationalized, and applications for imports through official channels must be approved by the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Finance. Private merchants holding business licenses may, how- ever, import and export basic goods under the control of the Foreign Trade Department. The Societee du Commerce Lao (SCL) carries out the actual trade transactions and collects a commission of 2 percent of the c . i .f. value of each export or import transaction. The SCL directly distributes the imported commodities and pays the import taxes. It values merchandise received under foreign aid at the domestic sale price of the product; import taxes on aid imports are levied on 80 percent of this price. Prescription of Currency No prescription of currency requirement is imposed on receipts or payments, but, in principle, the central bank provides and accepts only deutsche mark, French francs, Japanese yen, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. The Lao People's Democratic Republic has bilateral trading arrangements covering all commodity trade with Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Demo- cratic Republic, Hungary, the U .S .S .R ., and Viet Nam. The bilateral trading arrangements are for a period of five Deutsche mark, French francs, Japanese yen, pounds sterling, and Swiss francs. 332 years and are implemented through annual protocols, with annual limits on the deficits that Laos can incur for transactions with the partner countries; the deficits are in principle to be settled by means of trade transactions within six months from the end of the year of occurrence of the deficit; in some cases, however, such deficits may be converted into long-term loans. Imports and Import Payments The SCL has the monopoly on imports of investment goods, industrial inputs, and basic consumer goods. An annual import plan is formulated by the Department of Foreign Trade in the Ministry of Commerce, based on requests furnished by each government ministry, prov- ince, and state enterprise. In general, priority is given to the import of spare parts, raw materials, machinery, and basic commodities, including rice. The import program is reviewed and revised every three months during the fiscal year. An allocation of foreign exchange to a state enterprise lapses at the end of the year if it is not utilized; state enterprises may modify their import requirements during the year, subject to the approval of the Planning Committee. Individuals are allowed to export and import commodities outside SCL monopoly, provided that they submit a quarterly foreign trade plan specifying the way in which their imports will be financed. Settlement for imports must be channeled through the Lao Bank for Foreign Trade. Payments for Invisibles There is a foreign exchange budget detailing the Government's payments in foreign exchange during the fiscal year. Payments for all other invisibles are subject to prior authorization by the Ministry of Finance. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of gold and silver are prohibited, except when made by or on behalf of the monetary authorities. Export taxes are levied at rates ranging between 3 percent and 40 percent, depending on the commodity. State enter- prises normally must surrender their foreign exchange earnings to the State Bank, but in some cases enterprises are authorized to retain a specified proportion of their foreign exchange earnings in a special account at this bank; funds in such special accounts can then be used by the enterprise to import machinery and spare parts, as well as to cover certain prescribed operational expenses in foreign exchange. These amounts are not included in the annual import plan. A similar provision holds for provincial governments. The SCL has a monopoly on exports of timber, rice, mineral ore, coffee, cardamom, and stick lac. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles must be surrendered to the State Bank. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC Capital There is no foreign investment code. All outward capital transactions are prohibited. Gold Residents may buy and sell gold within the country but may not take it abroad except by authorization of the Lao Bank for Foreign Trade. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement July 1. The exchange rate applicable to private inward remittances by Lao nationals was depreciated from KN 108 per US$1 to KN 270 per US$1; purchases of foreign exchange from tourists and non-Lao resi- dents continued to be made at the rate of KN 108 per US$1. 333 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution LEBANON (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Lebanon is the Lebanese Pound. The authorities do not maintain margins in respect of ex- change transactions, and exchange rates are determined largely on the basis of demand and supply conditions in the exchange market. However, the authorities intervene when necessary in order to maintain orderly conditions in the exchange market. On December 31, 1985 the rate for the U .S. dollar was LL 18.10 per US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. The calculation of duties and taxes on goods and services on amounts invoiced or expressed in foreign currencies is based on an exchange rate of LL 10 = US$1. Prescription of Currency No restrictions are imposed on exchange payments abroad or receipts in Lebanon. Some transactions with Poland, with which Lebanon has a bilateral payments agreement, may be made through specific accounts denominated in U.S. dollars. Imports and Import Payments Imports of a few goods (mainly arms and ammunition, narcotics, and similar products) are either prohibited or reserved for the Government. All imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Imports of wheat and wheat derivatives, as well as of certain agricultural products that are produced locally, are either prohibited year-round or during a specified period of the year. Imports prohibited year-round include wheat, wh ich, in principle, may be imported only by the Government, and citrus fruits, apples, olives (excluding olives in cans weighing less than 2 kilograms), olive oil, and peanuts; imports prohibited at certain times include squash, eggplant, green beans, watermelons, peas, peaches, and apricots. The Government has a monopoly over petro- leum imports. Imports of certain other agricultural products and all seeds require a license. Import licenses are also required for certain finished goods, sanitary ceramic wares, and electric and telephone wires and cables made of copper. All other commodities may be imported freely without a license. Exchange to pay for imports may be obtained freely. Banks are obliged to ensure that importers are in possession of a valid import license, if required, before issuing letters of credit. A prior deposit in a local-currency amount equivalent to 15 percent of the value of import letters of credit must be placed by importers with their banks; such deposits are not required to be deposited by the banks with the Bank of Lebanon. A municipalities tax of 3.5 percent is levied on the value of all goods imported, except those originating in an Arab country. A stamp tax is applicable to all 334 imports, except gold and bank notes, at the following rates: LL 2 per mill for import values up to LL 100,000; LL 1.5 per mill for import values between LL 100,000 and LL 400,000; and LL 1 per mill for import values exceeding LL 400,000. A surcharge of 10 percent of the applicable import duty is levied on specified textiles and garments. Surcharges are also levied on motor vehicles, jewelry, watches, and alcoholic beverages. The rates of surcharge on motor vehicles, based on weight, are 20 piastres a kilogram up to 1,500 kilograms; 30 piastres a kilogram between 1,500 kilograms and 2,000 kilo- grams; and 40 piastres a kilogram over 2,000 kilograms. The rate of surcharge on watches and jewelry is 5 percent, and that on alcoholic beverages is LL 4 a liter, or LL 145 for a case of whiskey containing 12 bottles. Payments for Invisibles There are no restrictions on payments for invisibles. Exchange may be obtained through the free market. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of certain goods (mainly arms and ammu- nition, narcotics, and similar products) to any destination and all exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Exports of wheat and its derivatives, to any country, and all exports to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea require a license. Exchange receipts from exports may be retained, used, or sold in the free market. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles may be retained, used, or sold in the free market. Capital There are no limitations on capital payments or receipts. Exchange may be obtained or sold through the free market. Banks are permitted to pay interest on nonresident-held deposits denominated in Lebanese pounds. Bank credit in Lebanese pounds to residents for the purchase of foreign exchange for purposes other than foreign trade transactions is subject to a special reserve requirement; the required reserve amounts to 40 percent of Lebanese pound loans that directly give rise to foreign currency deposits and 15 percent of foreign currency deposits directly arising from Lebanese pound loans to depositors. Banks are authorized to maintain net foreign currency positions up to 15 percent of the amount of their own capital. Under a "free zone" banking facility, the commercial banks are exempt from reserve requirements and fees for deposit insurance in respect of foreign currency deposits. Nonresidents are exempt from the 10 percent tax on interest earnings from foreign currency deposits. Under a National Investment Insurance Scheme, new foreign investments are insured against losses arising ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution LEBANON from noncivil risks, including war. Compensation is paid on losses exceeding 5 percent of the insured value. Gold Residents may freely hold gold in any form at home or abroad and may freely negotiate gold in any form with residents and nonresidents at home or abroad.

Not for Redistribution LESOTHO (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Lesotho is the Lot! (plural maloti), which is equal in value to the South African rand. The principal intervention currency is the U .S. dollar. On December 31, 1985 the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were US$0.3880 and US$0.38770, respec- tively, per M 1. Subject to certain limitations, authorized dealers are permitted to conduct forward exchange operations. The South African Reserve Bank provides forward cover; for private sector transactions, such cover is given to authorized dealers based on the middle spot rate adjusted by a percentage factor announced from time to time. The South African rand is also legal tender in Lesotho. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Beginning from September 2, 1985, a dual exchange rate system (discontinued in February 1983) has been reintroduced. Under the sys- tem, local sales proceeds of Rand Monetary Area (RMA) securities and other investments owned by non-RMA residents cannot be transferred in foreign currency, but must be retained in the form of "financial rand" balances. Such balances are transferable among nonresidents at a freely determined exchange rate. The system involves a multiple currency practice applicable to capital transactions. Exchange Control Territory Lesotho forms part of the Rand Monetary Area, which is an exchange control territory comprising Lesotho, South Africa, and Swaziland. No restrictions are applied to payments within the RMA; these are uncontrolled and unrecorded. In relation to countries outside the RMA, Lesotho applies exchange controls that are largely similar to those of South Africa and Swaziland. Administration of Control The Central Bank of Lesotho controls external cur- rency transactions. Authority to approve certain types of current payments is delegated to commercial banks up to established limits. Lesotho's trade licensing arrange- ments are designed mainly to raise revenue and to prevent tax evasion; permits are issued by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Licenses for financial institu- tions and insurance agents are issued by the Central Bank of Lesotho. Imports and Import Payments Lesotho is a member of a customs union w i th Botswana, South Africa, and Swaziland, and there are no restrictions on imports originating in any country of the customs union. Imports from countries outside the customs union are usually licensed in conformity with South Afr ica's import regulations; Lesotho reserves the right to restrict certain imports. Import permits are valid for all countries and entitle the holder to buy the foreign exchange required to make the import payment upon customs entry. There are no bilateral payments arrangements. 336 Exports and Export Proceeds Certain exports are subject to licensing for revenue purposes; this requirement, in practice, is restricted to the export of diamonds. Most exports are shipped without license to or through South Afr ica. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments to nonresidents for current transactions, although subject to control, are not normally restricted. Authority to approve some types of current payments has been delegated to authorized dealers up to established limits. The basic annual exchange allowance for tourist travel to neighboring countries outside the RMA is M 4,000 per person; the corresponding annual allowance for tourist travel to other countries is M 6,000 in a calendar year for an adult and M 3,000 for a child. The allowance for business travel to neighboring countries is M 10,000 in a calendar year at rates not exceeding M 400 a day. The corresponding limits for business travel to other countries are M 10,000 and M 500, respectively. Emigrant allowances can be transferred through the financial rand market, up to M 100,000 a family or M 50,000 a person. Capital Applications for outward transfers of capital are considered on their merits. The rulings on applications for inward and outward capital transfers may depend on whether the applicant is a temporarily resident foreign national, a nonresident, or a resident. Certain tax incentives for inward direct investment are provided to manufacturing undertakings approved by a Pioneer Industries Board under the Pioneer Industries Encour- agement Act, 1969. The free transfer of income from an emigrant's blocked assets is limited to an annual max- imum of M 100,000 a fam i ly un i t. An emigrant family or an individual may export one automobile only, with a max imum value of M 20,000, provided the automobile was purchased at least one year prior to emigration. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell any gold coin that is legal tender. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement September 2. Lesotho reintroduced a dual exchange rate system under which local sales of proceeds of RMA securities and other investments owned by nonresidents of the RMA should be held in "financial rand" balances, transferable at a freely determined exchange rate only among nonresidents of the RMA. In addition, the max imum permissible amount transferable through the financial rand market in the form of emigrant allowance was fixed at M 100,000 a family or M 50,000 a person. ©International Monetary Fund.

There is no official intervention. U .S. currency is legal tender in Liberia and circulates along with Liberian coinage. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Prescription of Currency No prescription of currency requirements are in force. Settlements with the Central Bank of West African States (for Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'lvoire, Niger, Senegal, and Togo) and The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are normally made through the West African Clearing House. Imports and Import Payments There is no general system of import control, but the importation of some items is subject to licensing and quantitative restrictions by the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Transportation and the National Invest- ment Commission to protect local industry. These items include automobile batteries, exercise books and note pads, insecticides, kitchen towels, roofing nails, paint, paper napkins, sugar, toilet tissues, wheat flour, portland cement, and liquefied petroleum gas. A few items (e.g., arms and ammunition, explosives, used clothing, and Pharmaceuticals) require prior licenses. Private imports of rice, household candles, safety matches, and pow- dered detergents have been suspended temporarily. In addition, imports of certain goods (e .g ., pornographic literature and narcotics other than for medicinal pur- poses) and all imports from South Africa are prohibited. Petroleum is imported only by the Liberia Petroleum Refining Company, and by the mining and rubber companies for their own use; a private company is the sole distributor of aviation fuel. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to South Africa are prohibited. Exports of rice have been temporarily suspended. Export licenses are at present required for precious metals, precious stones, elephant tusks and ivory, wild animals, cement, agricul- tural products other than rubber, flour, and sugar, and certain other items, such as arms and ammunition and explosives. Licenses are generally issued freely, and no licenses are required for direct exports by foreign concession holders; licenses serve mainly to enforce taxation or, for agricultural products, to assure certi- fication of quality and origin and to safeguard the export monopoly of the Liberia Produce Marketing Corpora- tion. The surrender of export proceeds is not required, and exchange receipts are freely disposable. An export tax is levied on diamonds. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles There are no limitations on payments for or receipts from invisibles. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or payments by residents or nonresidents, other than a limit of $ 1,000 a person on capital export in the form of cash. Under an Investment Incentive Code of 1966 (as amended in 1973), enterprises undertaking new investment projects may be granted a five-year, 90 per- cent duty exemption on imports of raw materials and machinery, total tax exemption on reinvested profits, a 50 percent exemption on distributable profits, and a protective tariff on competing imported products. The five-year incentive may be renewed for a further two years in certain circumstances. Gold Residents may freely and without license purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form are subject to licenses issued by the Ministry of Land, Mines, and Energy; import licenses are issued freely, but export licenses are granted restrictively. Changes During 1985 Imports and Import Payments February 1. A surcharge of 10 percent was imposed on all dutiable imports from non-dollar areas. May 1. The surcharge imposed on February 1, 1985 was replaced by an increase of 10 percentage points on all import duties, with specified exceptions. December 1.

The middle rate for the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, is LD 0.296053 = US$1. The Central Bank of Libya publishes daily buying and selling rates for 17 currencies.2 It deals with commercial banks only in pounds sterling and U.S. dol- lars at rates fixed daily. The commercial banks are permitted to buy or sell other currencies against pounds sterling and U .S. dollars through their foreign correspondents. The banks may not deal among themselves in foreign currencies. Neither authorized banks nor importers or exporters are allowed to enter into forward commitments in foreign currencies. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Central Bank, which has delegated some of its powers to the authorized banks. Policy relating to imports and exports is deter- mined by the Popular Congresses and executed by the General People's Committee for Economy and Trade. Prescription of Currency Settlements with other countries are made in convert- ible currencies, usually U .S. dollars or pounds ster- ling. All settlements with Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts A nonresident, as defined by the Central Bank, who is gainfully employed in the country is permitted under the exchange control regulations to open and maintain a nonresident account in Libyan dinars with any autho- rized bank. Legitimate earnings of such nonresidents can be credited to their nonresident accounts. Similarly, authorized banks have authority to credit interest earned on savings balances in these nonresident accounts. All other credits to nonresident accounts require the prior approval of the Central Bank. (For debits on such accounts, see section on Payments for Invisibles, below.) Funds brought in by nonresident contractors undertak- ing contracts in their own names are required to be kept ^n March 18, 1986 the authorities of the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya pegged the Libyan dinar to the SDR at the rate of LD 1.00 = SDR 2.80; buy ing and selling for the Libyan dinar in terms of the major currencies would be based on their exchange rates vis-a- vis the SDR, as communicated by the IMF. 2Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Lebanese pounds, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Saudi Arabian riyals, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, Tunisian dinars, and U .S. dollars. 338 with an authorized bank. Payments received by contrac- tors in respect of their contracts may also be credited to these accounts. Remittances from these accounts are subject to the prior approval of the Central Bank after submission of the prescribed evidence bu t, in general, remittance is permitted up to the net of the tax amount specified in the contract. Nonresident-owned capital that is not permitted to be transferred abroad is credited to blocked accounts. With the approval of the Central Bank, funds in blocked accounts (with certain exceptions) may be used for expenditures in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya up to LD 500 a year to cover the cost of visits by the owner of the funds or a close relative; for payment of legal fees, taxes, etc.; for remittances to the owner of the funds in his country of permanent residence (up to LD 1,000 in a calendar year); and for remittances in cases of hardship. When the funds have been in a blocked account for five years, they qua l ify, upon payment of due taxes, for remittance in full to the owner in his country of permanent residence. The blocked accounts of persons (with certain exceptions) who have left the country permanently are being released in installments; balances credited prior to March 31, 1966 have been released. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Israel and South Africa are pro- hibited. Imports included in the annual Commodity Budget are undertaken exclusively by state-owned enter- prises without license. Importers are required to deal directly with producers abroad and not through inter- mediaries. However, imports not included in the Com- modity Budget are subject to licensing. Resident and nonresident firms undertaking development projects may import needed items that are not included in the annual Commodity Budget and not available locally. There is a prohibited import list, consisting mainly of consumer and luxury goods.3 Only government agencies may act as commercial agents, including import agents, for foreign companies. A state-owned company con- trolled by the Central Bank has a monopoly over the import of gold and precious metals. With certain exceptions, all exchange permits require central bank approval. Exchange permits required for imports are readily granted by the authorized banks following central bank approval, provided that there is a firm contract and an import license has been obtained from the Secretariat of Economy and, if the import is to be made on a letter of credit basis, that a marine insurance policy from a local insurance company is submitted before the letter of credit is established. 3These include mineral water, fruit juices, instant tea, certain types of coffee, green vegetables, poultry, preserved meats and vegeta- bles, alcoholic beverages, peanuts, fresh f ru i t, oriental rugs, soaps, envelopes, crystal chandeliers, toy guns, luxury cars, and furs. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SOCIALIST PEOPLE'S LIBYAN ARAB JAMAHIRIYA However, no letter of credit in respect of the import of consumer durable goods may be opened by an authorized bank w i thout a required cash margin based on the import price. Importers must present to the bank granting the exchange permit, w i th in two months of customs clear- ance, a customs declaration conf irm ing clearance and stating the valuation. The approval of the Exchange Control Department of the Central Bank is required for all payments by residents. Imports are subject to customs duties and customs surcharges, the latter consisting of 10 percent of the applicable customs du ty. All Tunisian products and certain products from Algeria, Morocco, and Syria are exempt from duties. Payments for Invisibles The authorized banks are empowered to approve allocations for travel as indicated below. Remittances from nonresident accounts maintained by nonresident workers and technicians may be approved by authorized banks up to limits specified below: (1) Nonresidents employed by the state, state-owned enterprises, and foreign companies may remit up to 50 percent of their net salaries each month if their contracts do not specify that lodging, board, or both will be made available free of charge by the employer, or up to 75 percent of net salary if their contracts specify that both lodging and board at worksites in remote areas w i ll be made available free of charge by the employer in accordance w i th applicable L ibyan laws and regulations. (2) Nonresidents employed by the Libyan private sector may remit up to 50 percent of their net salaries, provided that the monthly net remittance does not exceed LD 40 for agricultural and unskilled workers, and LD 60 for technical workers. In general, nonresidents may not transfer income derived from overtime work. In addition to limits on transfers, there is an upper l im it of LD 400 on the value of goods that nonresidents going abroad permanently can take; the value in excess of this allowance is deducted from the transferable portion of earnings. Staff of UN agencies, embassies, consulates, and medical institutions are ex- empt from these regulations. Banks may issue traveler's checks and foreign currency notes to nonresident work- ers and technicians w i th in the limits mentioned. All other payments for invisibles, as well as payments in excess of the approval authority delegated to the banks, require prior approval from the Central Bank. Applica- tions are considered on their merits. Residents leaving for personal travel abroad, includ- ing tourist travel, may, in addition, take out foreign exchange in the form of foreign currency notes, travel- er's checks, and letters of credit not exceeding a total value of LD 300 (LD 150 for children under 12) in a calendar year as a basic travel allowance; the exchange may be obtained from any authorized bank in the L ibyan Arab Jamah ir iya. Additional amounts may be granted in special circumstances. Pilgrims are entitled to a special quota. Temporary residents may take out any traveler's checks or foreign currency notes that they had previously brought in and declared to the customs. Travelers from the Libyan Arab Jamah ir iya may not take out Libyan currency. Exports and Export Proceeds Export licenses are required only for fish, raw wool, hides and sk ins, and for agricultural products. Export proceeds must be received through an authorized bank w i th in six months of shipment. Exports of nonmonetary gold (other than for processing abroad), vegetable oils, and scrap metals are prohibited; exports or re-exports of wheat, wheat flour, crushed whea t, barley, rice, tea, sugar, tomato paste, and macaroni, wh ich are subsidized commodities, are also prohibited. All exports to Israel and South A f r ica are prohibited. Proceeds from Invisibles All foreign exchange receipts must be surrendered. Traveler's checks or foreign currency notes may be encashed only at an authorized bank, an exchange office, or a hotel licensed by the Central Bank. Travelers entering the country may bring w i th them traveler's checks, letters of credit, securities, coupons, and other negotiable instruments in un l im i ted amounts; these must be declared to the customs. Foreign exchange converted into L ibyan dinars by visiting tourists may be reconverted upon departure, w i th the exception of a m in imum local expenditure of US$50 for each day spent in the country. Capital Under the provisions of Foreign Capital Investment Law No. 37 of J u ly 31, 1968, foreign capital invested in projects deemed to contribute to the economic devel- opment of the coun try, as well as profits thereon, may be transferred freely to the country of origin, provided that the paid-up capital is not less than LD 200,000 and that at least 51 percent of the shares are held by foreign nationals. Salaries of foreign staff employed on such projects may be transferred on the basis described above in the section under Payments for Invisibles. Central bank approval is required and cus tomar i ly granted freely for all such transfers. Foreign participation in industrial ventures set up after March 20, 1970 is permitted on a minority basis, but only if it leads to increased produc- tion in excess of local requirements, introduction of the latest technology, and cooperation w i th foreign firms in exporting the surplus production. Insurance companies and foreign shareholdings in banks have been nation- alized. Commercial firms have been Libyanized in vary ing degrees, and 51 percent or more of the Libyan interests of the international oil companies have been nationalized. Real estate may be owned in Libya only by Libyans. Nonresident-owned capital that is not permitted to be transferred abroad is credited to blocked accounts (see section on Nonresident Accoun ts, above).

Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form other than bars. The Central Bank imports processed and unprocessed gold and precious metals; it also sells gold in bars to domestic goldsmiths for manufacture at prices announced from time to time. The gold is processed before it may be sold to the public. Unworked gold is subject to an import duty of 15 percent. Imports and Import Payments January JO.

Not for Redistribution MADAGASCAR (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Madagascar is the Malagasy Franc. The Malagasy franc is pegged to a basket of several currencies. The weight assigned to each currency in the basket is based on the distribution of Madagascar's trade during 1973-80. There is no single intervention cur- rency, although the majority of transactions take place in French francs and U .S. dollars. In accordance with the movement in the basket, the Central Bank of Madagas- car adjusts the Malagasy franc exchange rates on a daily basis against ten currencies1 which it quotes. The authorized banks are not permitted to maintain an exchange position in any foreign currency although they may hold trade bills as foreign assets. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. On December 31, 1985 the midpoint rate for the U .S. dollar quoted by the Central Bank of Madagascar was FMG 635.79 = US$1. Administration of Control All countries other than Madagascar are considered foreign countries, and financial relations with all foreign countries are subject to exchange control. Exchange control is administered by the Exchange Control Office of the Directorate of the Treasury, which also supervises borrowing and lending abroad by residents, the issue, sale, or introduction of foreign securities in Madagascar, all outward investments, and inward direct investment. Some of the approval authority for exchange control has been delegated to authorized intermediaries, and all exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through such intermediaries. Import licenses are issued by the Directorate of Imports in the Ministry of Commerce. Export authorizations are issued either by the Directorate of Exports in the Ministry of Commerce or by other specified public agencies. Prescription of Currency Payments and receipts must be effected through the authorized intermediaries, which may deal with the Central Bank in any of the quoted currencies. Nonresident Accounts The principal type of nonresident account is the Foreign Account in Malagasy Francs. Such accounts may be debited and credited only for transactions between nonresidents and for explicitly authorized trans- actions between residents and nonresidents. When Malagasy francs accruing to a nonresident are not eligible for credit to a Foreign Account, they must be credited to a Special Blocked Account, balances in 'Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, and U .S. dollars. which may be used by the holder for personal expenses in Madagascar, subject to a limit of FMG 20,000 a day for the account holder and FMG 10,000 a day for each accompanying family member. Any other operation requires the prior approval of the Ministry of Finance and Economy. Imports and Import Payments Importers require the approval of the Ministry of Commerce before they are permitted to engage in import activities. All imports are subject to an annual import program, the overall value of which is determined by the Ministry of Finance and Economy, the Ministries of Commerce and Industry, and the Central Bank. The Ministry of Commerce allocates quotas to importers within the overall limit of the import program, and licenses are issued freely up to the limits of those quotas. There are two categories of quotas: those open to merchants and those open to industrial enterprises and other importers who are final users of the product. The import of certain items, including alcoholic beverages, rice, wheat flour, vegetable oils, and cement, is reserved for the Regie Malgache des Monopoles Fiscaux and the government-owned agricultural trading firm, SINPA. Under the Import Liberalization System (Systeme Liberale d'Importation —SYLI), quota and licensing restrictions have been eliminated for certain products, and administrative formalities have been simplified for other specified import items. All import transactions valued at FMG 10,000 or more must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Central Bank authorization for each transaction is represented by a certificate issued by the commercial bank concerned, which is required to clear the merchandise through customs. The import license entitles importers to pur- chase the necessary exchange (but not earlier than eight days before shipment when a documentary credit is opened). Because of foreign exchange difficulties, it has not been possible since about mid-1981 to adhere strictly to the annual import program. In practice, an ad hoc committee (Comite Technique des Paiements Exterieurs) consisting of representatives of all ministries concerned, the Central Bank, and the commercial banks, and chaired by the Minister of Finance and Economy, meets on a weekly basis to administer the limited available foreign exchange and to ensure that the actual imports are in line with programmed priorities and do not exceed foreign exchange availabilities. There are arrears on payments for imports. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require the prior approval of the Ministry of Finance, wh ich has delegated approval authority to the Directorate of the Treasury and to 341 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MADAGASCAR authorized intermediaries, either up to specified limits or for any amount that is properly documented. Residents may purchase foreign exchange for tourism subject to an annual limit of FMG 100,000 a person a year (FMG 50,000 for children under ten). Any foreign exchange remaining after return to Madagascar must be surrendered. For business travel, foreign exchange may be purchased up to the equivalent of FMG 10,000 a person a day, subject to a maximum of FMG 300,000 a year. Authorized banks may not sell foreign bank notes in excess of the equivalent of FMG 20,000 a person a trip for tourist or business travel. Applications for additional amounts, and applications for exchange for any other type of travel, must be submitted to the Ministry of Finance and Economy. Applications for additional foreign exchange may be approved for bona fide business trips and for medical treatment abroad, but not for tourism. Allocations for different types of travel may not be combined without the prior approval of the Directorate of the Treasury. There are limits for educational expenses and certain other current invisibles. Dividends are transferable in full when distributed by industrial firms and up to 75 percent in other cases; they may be transferred only to nonresident physical or juridical persons of foreign nationality. The transfer of savings from wages and salaries earned by a foreigner working in Madagascar is permitted, upon presentation of his work contract and employment permit, and provided that the transfer takes place within three months of the pay period. The amounts allowed are up to 25 percent of the net salary for bachelors and persons whose families are in Madagas- car, and up to 45 percent for those whose families live outside Madagascar (100 percent for both categories during leave spent outside Madagascar); in all cases, the transferable amount may not exceed FMG 330,000 a person a month. Resident and nonresident travelers to foreign countries may take out up to FMG 5,000 in Malagasy bank notes. Nonresident travelers may take out any remaining foreign bank notes and coin and other foreign means of payment declared by them on entry. There are arrears on payments for invisibles. Exports and Export Proceeds Enterprises require the prior authorization (carte a" ex- portation) of the Ministry of Commerce to engage in export activity. All exports to all destinations require an export permit (autorisation d exportation) issued by the Directorate of Exports in the Ministry of Commerce or the appropriate commodity stabilization office. Export proceeds received in foreign currencies must be surren- dered; such proceeds normally become due not later than one month after arrival of the goods at their destination, unless the Directorate of the Treasury waives this requirement. All commercial export transactions valued at FMG 50,000 or more must be domiciled with an authorized intermediary, and the exporter must sign a commitment to repatriate the foreign currency proceeds. 342 Subject to special authorization from the Ministry of Finance and Economy, exporters of nontraditional goods may retain some of the foreign exchange proceeds from their export operations in a special account in foreign exchange called an EPI Account; such exporters may use the foreign exchange to import spare parts and raw materials required for their own export activities. The government-owned trading firms (COROI, Roso, SICE, SINPA, and SOMACODIS) have a monopoly over exports of certain important commodities such as coffee, cloves, and pepper. Proceeds from Invisibles All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services, and all income or proceeds accruing in those countries or from nonresidents, must be repatri- ated within one month of the due date. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of means of payment denominated in a foreign currency and up to FMG 5,000 in Malagasy bank notes. Capital Capital movements between Madagascar and foreign countries and between residents and nonresidents are subject to prior authorization by the Ministry of Finance and Economy. Special controls are maintained over borrowing abroad, over inward direct investment and all outward investment, and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Madagascar. Foreign direct investments in Madagascar,2 require prior approval of the Minister of Finance and Economy (the Directorate of the Treasury). Malagasy direct investments abroad3 are prohibited without special authorization from the Ministry of Finance and Econ- omy. The total or partial liquidation of such investments must be declared to the Ministry of Finance and Economy. Both the making and the liquidation of direct investments, whether these are Malagasy investments abroad or foreign investments in Madagascar, must be reported to the Minister within 20 days following each transaction. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a company, but such participation is subject to prior declaration to the Minis- try of Finance and Economy. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Madagascar requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance and Economy. Exempt from authorization are operations in connection with shares similar to securities whose issue, offering, or sale in Madagascar has previously been authorized. Borrowing abroad by physical or juridical persons, whether public or private, requires prior authorization by the Minister of Including those made by companies in Madagascar that are directly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in Madagascar of foreign companies. 3 Including those made through foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in Madagascar and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Madagascar. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Finance and Economy, although loans contracted by authorized banks or credit institutions with special legal status are exempt. Lending abroad is subject to authori- zation by the Ministry of Finance and Economy. In accordance with the Investment Code of June 18, 1985 (Law No. 85-001), foreign or domestic enterprises of special importance to the economy may be granted preferred status arrangements. Such enterprises may benefit from specified advantages relating to import duties, income taxes, import licenses, and other financial and economic benefits. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Madagascar. Imports and exports of gold require prior authorization by the Ministry of Commerce. Exempt from this requirement are (1) im- ports and exports by or on behalf of the Central Bank; (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles contain- ing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold- plated articles); and (3) imports by travelers of gold jewelry and other articles of gold up to 500 grams a family and numismatic items up to 200 grams a family. Imports of gold, whether licensed or exempt from license, are subject to customs declaration. Newly mined gold must be surrendered to the Directorate of Industry and Mines, which, in principle, must deliver it to the Central Bank after processing. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement January 2. The Malagasy franc was devalued by 3.29 percent against the currency composite used to determine its exchange rate. March 5. The Malagasy franc was devalued by 2.44 percent against the currency composite used to determine its exchange rate. March 20. The Malagasy franc was devalued by 2.34 percent against the currency composite used to de- termine its exchange rate. July 9. The Malagasy franc was devalued by 1.96 per- cent against the currency composite used to determine its exchange rate. October 18. The Malagasy franc was devalued by 0.99 percent against the currency composite used to MADAGASCAR determine its exchange rate. (It was also devalued by the same margin on two subsequent occasions: November 11 and 18, 1985.) December 12. The Malagasy franc was devalued by 1.48 percent against the currency composite used to determine its exchange rate. December 23. The Malagasy franc was devalued by 1.48 percent against the currency composite used to determine its exchange rate. Foreign Accounts June 3. The regular accounts maintained by foreign technical assistants and civil servants assigned to Madagascar may be credited only with amounts from a foreign account in Malagasy francs, or with their salaries paid in Malagasy francs. In this context, the term "foreign civil servants" was defined to mean all foreign staff of embassies, diplomatic missions, and interna- tional organizations in Madagascar. Exports and Export Proceeds April 9. By Order No. 1610/85 of April 9, 1985, the facility permitting exporters, subject to prior approval, to retain specified percentages of export proceeds in special accounts in foreign exchange (known as EPI Accounts) was extended to all direct exports of nontraditional goods ( i .e ., goods other than coffee, vanilla, cloves, etc.). (Previously, only exporters of certain manufactured products were eligible to use the facility.) The foreign exchange thus held could be used by the exporters to import spare parts and raw materials required for their export activities. Capital June 18. Law No. 85-001 promulgated a new Invest- ment Code abrogating Ordinance No. 73-057 and Decree 73-271 of September 19, 1973, which estab- lished the previous Investment Code. The new code, aimed at simplifying approval procedures, provided for the granting of preferred status to enterprises in specified industrial sectors, on the basis of their programs regard- ing, inter alia, investment goals, production, and malagasization of managers; approved enterprises could receive customs, tax, and other financial and economic benefits for specified periods. 343 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MALAWI (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Malawi is the Malawi Kwacha, wh ich is pegged to a basket of currencies based on the geographical composition of Malawi's trade and the invoicing currencies in Malawi's foreign exchange trans- actions. The middle rate of the Malawi kwacha for the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, quoted by the Reserve Bank of Malawi is determined on the basis of the daily calculations of the exchange rate of the U .S. dollar in terms of the SDR. On December 31, 1985 the Reserve Bank's buy ing and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were MK 1.6750 and MK 1.6878, respectively, per US$1. The Reserve Bank also quotes buy ing and selling rates for the Canadian dollar, the deutsche mark, the French f ranc, the South African rand, the pound sterling, the Swiss franc, the Zambian kwacha, and the Zimbabwe dollar, wh ich are determined on the basis of the appropriate daily cross rates as communicated by the International Monetary Fund. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Reserve Bank under authority delegated to it by the Minister of Finance. Import policy is formulated by the Minister of Trade, Industry, and Tourism, who also is responsible for the issue of import and export licenses. Prescription of Currency Payments to nonresidents may be made in Malawi kwacha to the credit of a nonresident account maintained by the recipient or in any convertible foreign currency1 traded in Malawi. Payments from residents of other countries may be received in Malawi kwacha from a nonresident account or in any convertible foreign currency. Nonresident Accounts Accounts in Malawi kwacha held by residents of other countries are designated nonresident accounts. These accounts may be credited w i th the proceeds from sales of any convertible foreign currency, with authorized pay- ments in Malawi kwacha to foreign countries by Mala- wian residents, and w i th transfers from other nonresident accounts. Balances on these accounts may be used to make payments to residents of Malawi for any purpose and may be transferred freely to other nonresident accounts; these accounts may also be debited for pay- ments to the account holder while he is temporarily resident in Malawi. 'Under Ma law i 's exchange control regulations, all currencies other than the Ma lawi kwacha are considered foreign currencies. 344 Blocked Accounts in Malawi kwacha are held w i th authorized banks by residents of any country other than Malawi. All debits and credits to such accounts require the prior authorization of the exchange control authori- ties. Normally, authorization is given for the investment of balances of Blocked Accounts in an approved manner. On application to the exchange control authorities, the interest on Blocked Account balances is normally trans- ferable to the account holder's country of residence. Imports and Import Payments The allocation of foreign exchange for imports is based on an annual foreign exchange budget. For a number of items2 import licenses are required regardless of the country of origin. All other goods3 may be imported under an open general license when originating in Commonwealth countries or in non-Commonwealth countries that are members of the GATT. For other countries an import license is required for all com- modities except certain items that are free from licensing irrespective of origin, such as petroleum products, exposed cinematographic films, samples, and advertis- ing materials. After hav ing obtained a license, importers must submit an application for foreign exchange to a commer- cial bank prior to ordering goods. Applications must be accompanied by pro forma invoices. In principle, com- mercial banks are authorized to approve foreign ex- change up to MK 100 without reference to the Reserve Bank; however, as a matter of practice, commercial banks refer all foreign exchange applications to the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank allocates foreign exchange accord- ing to guidelines regarding the priority of imports and with reference to a foreign exchange budget. Essential goods such as fuel and petroleum products, agricultural and industrial inpu ts, medicines, food, and clothing are given high priority. Nonessential items, such as luxury consumer items and goods for wh ich import substitutes are available, are given low priority. This application process takes about two months. When approved goods arrive in the country and pay- ments are due, the importer must make a further applica- tion for foreign currency payments. Such applications 2Certain agricultural and food products, new (m i l i ta ry type) and used c lo th ing, gold, sugar, wheat flour, cement, fe r t i l ize rs, newspr int and certain paper products, pencils, ball-point pens, o f f ice s tap l ing machines and staples, pr in t ing inks, erasers, hand-operated number ing stamps, flick kn iv e s, explosives, arms and ammun i t ion, game traps, mist nets, w i ld an ima ls, l ive fish, cassava, and copyright articles. 3A licensing system based on tar iff quotas and linked to purchases of domestic substitutes is applied to imports of c lo th ing items under two tariff headings. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution must be accompanied by relevant customs documents. Commercial banks may require counterpart deposits depending on means of payment (e .g ., letter of credit); but this is a matter of banking practice and is not required by official regulations. The Reserve Bank authorizes payment after ascertaining the bona fides of the exchange application. The normal period needed to complete the administrative procedures is about two to four weeks. Any transfer of funds in anticipation of imports is prohibited, except with the permission of the exchange control authorities. Payments against sight letters of credit and sight bills of exchange are not permitted. Imports may be paid for in Malawi currency to an appropriate local nonresident account or in any convert- ible currency. Du ty payable on imports is calculated based on a composite rate which consists of import levy (fixed at 5 percent), surtax (up to 30 percent), and customs duty (up to 45 percent), depending on the tariff classification of imports. The composite rate is 80.5 per- cent on average. Payments for Invisibles Exchange to pay for invisibles related to imports requires prior approval of the exchange control authori- ties. For other purposes, such as foreign travel, foreign exchange is provided up to certain limits by authorized dealers without prior reference to the exchange control authorities. The basic exchange allowance for private travel is MK 20 a day for an adult, with a maximum of MK 600 a calendar year. For children up to 10 years of age, the basic exchange allowance is MK 200; for children over 10 years up to 18 years, the allowance is MK 300 a year. Annual allowances are not cumulative but may be increased by up to 50 percent if the traveler has not applied for a travel allowance during the preceding three years. Allocations are subject to a combined maximum of MK 2,000 a year for a family traveling together. The basic exchange allowance for business travel is up to MK 400 a trip for any number of trips a year. Exchange is provided, subject to certain limits, for other purposes such as education, medical treatment, and family remittances. Applications for amounts exceeding the standard allocations may be submitted to the exchange control authorities. Foreign nationals employed in Malawi on contracts and holding a temporary employment permit are allowed to remit up to two thirds of their current net earnings to their country of normal residence. Travelers may take out up to MK 20 in Malawi currency and the equivalent of MK 20 in foreign currency in addition to their basic travel allowance. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of goods of any description that exceed MK 100 in value are not allowed, unless the Controller of Customs and Excise is satisfied that payment has been made or will be made in an appropriate manner to a MALAWI resident of Malawi not later than six months after the date of exportation. Certain commodities4 are subject to export licensing, mainly to ensure the adequacy of domestic supplies. Export proceeds in foreign currency must be sold to an authorized dealer. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in any foreign currency must be sold to an authorized dealer. There is no limitation on the amount of foreign currency notes and coin that may be imported by travelers, but not more than MK 20 in Malawi currency notes and coin may be imported. Capital Inward transfers of capital are not restricted, with the exception that the taking up of loans from abroad by residents requires prior exchange control approval, which is normally granted, provided that the terms of repayment, including the servicing costs, are acceptable. Outward transfers of capital are controlled, but nonresi- dents are permitted to repatriate their investments when they have satisfied the authorities that the original investment was made with funds brought into the country; there are no restrictions on the transfer abroad of dividends and profits of foreign-owned companies, provided that no recourse is being made to local borrowing to finance the transfer. Residents may not purchase any foreign securities without specific exchange control approval. In general, residents are not permitted to transfer capital abroad and, with certain exceptions, they are required to offer for sale to an authorized dealer any foreign exchange that accrues to them. Residents require prior approval to lend to nonresidents or to resident firms controlled directly or indirectly from outside Malawi. Approval to lend to nonresident-controlled firms may be withheld if it is felt there is excessive recourse to local borrowing and that a firm has brought in insufficient working capital from abroad. All applications for emigrants' allowances must be submitted to the exchange control authorities for ap- proval: (1) Persons 50 years of age and over are allowed exchange up to MK 15,000, whether single or married. (2) Married persons under 50 are allowed MK 6,000 on departure, together with MK 500 for each child, up to a maximum of MK 8,000 for a fam i ly. (3) Unmarried persons under 50 years of age are allowed MK 3,000 on departure. (4) The balance of the emigrant's funds is blocked, but on the anniversary of the departure date from Malawi a sum equal to the original emigration allowance is permitted to be transferred to the new country of residence, up to a max imum of MK 8,000. Implements of war, petroleum products, n icke l, atomic energy materials, and certain agricultural and animal products. 345 ©International Monetary Fund.

With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and autho- rized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold at home or abroad in any form other than jewelry. Imports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Minister of Trade and Industry in consultation with the Ministry of Finance; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement April 2. The kwacha was depreciated by 14.84 percent in terms of the U .S. dollar; as a result, the middle rate of the kwacha in terms of the U .S. dollar changed from MK I i5277 - US$1, to MK 1.7940 = US$1.

Not for Redistribution MALAYSIA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Malaysia is the Ringgit. The external value of the ringgit is determined on the basis of its relationship to a basket of currencies weighted in terms of Malaysia's major trading partners and the currencies of settlement. The exchange rate of the ringgit in terms of the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is deter- mined in the foreign exchange market, and the Central Bank of Malaysia intervenes in order to promote relative stability in the value of the ringgit in relation to the basket of currencies. Rates for all other currencies are determined on the basis of the ringgit-U.S. dollar rate and the U.S. dollar rates for those currencies in markets abroad. The buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar on December 31, 1985 were M$2.4130 and M$2.4140, respectively, per US$1. The commercial banks are free to determine and quote exchange rates for all currencies to customers and are permitted to deal forward in all currencies. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Malaysia formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from November 11, 1968. Administration of Control The Central Bank administers exchange control throughout Malaysia on behalf of the Malaysian Govern- ment, the Governor of the Bank being the Controller of Foreign Exchange. Most of the authority for approving payments abroad is delegated to authorized banks. The authority for import control rests with the Central Government. The day-to-day administration of import control throughout Malaysia is carried out jointly by the Ministry of Trade and Industry and other specified authorities such as the Ministry of Primary Industries, Malaysian Timber Board, and the Veterinary Depart- ment, together with the Royal Customs and Excise Department. Prescription of Currency All payments to countries other than Israel and South Africa may be made either in ringgit through an External Account or in any currency other than Israeli and South African currencies. Receipts from exports to countries other than Israel and South Africa must be obtained according to the timing of payment specified in the commercial contract, but subject to a maximum period of six months from the date of exportation, either in ringgit obtained from the sale of a specified currency to a bank in Malaysia or in any specified currency. Special regulations apply to settlements with Israel and South Africa. Nonresident Accounts The accounts in ringgit of residents of countries other than Malaysia are designated as External Accounts. There are no restrictions on debits to External Accounts. Credits to these accounts for whatever purpose are freely permitted, subject only to the completion of exchange control forms for amounts above M$l0,000. The pro- ceeds from the sale of any foreign currency may be credited to External Accounts. For amounts exceeding M$l0,000, permission may be given by authorized commercial banks. Balances in External Accounts may be transferred to any other account, whether resident or nonresident, and may be converted into any currency except Israeli and South African currencies. Accounts of residents of Israel and South Africa are designated as Israeli Accounts and South African Accounts, respec- tively. All debits and credits to such accounts require prior approval. Imports and Import Payments Tariffs and import controls of the various parts of Malaysia have been fully unified. Depending on the nature and origin of the goods, specific licenses are required for certain imports for reasons of health, sec- urity, or public policy; various conditions must be satis- fied before licenses for such goods are issued. Certain other imports are subject to quantitative restrictions as a temporary measure to protect local industries; these restrictions are reviewed from time to time. Imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Imports from the People's Republic of China are subject to specific license. Imports of motor vehicles are subject to specific licen- sing with quantitative restriction. Movements of live animals between Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sara- wak are subject to movement permits issued by the Vet- erinary Department. Imports of meat, bones, hides, skin, hooves, horns, and offal of any animal or any portion thereof from India require a specific license. Imports of primates are under specific license, subject to approval from the Department of Wildlife and National Parks. Payment for permitted imports is allowed after exchange control formalities have been met. Raw materials and machinery for the manufacturing sector are eligible for preferential treatment duty as follows: (a) raw materials not manufactured locally are subject to a reduced rate of import duty of 2 percent; (b) industries can be further exempted from this 2 percent import duty if they comply with the New Economic Policy in terms of equity participation, management, and employment structure; (c) all customs duties and sales tax on imported ma- chinery and equipment that is unavailable locally and used directly in the manufacturing process can be considered for exemption; and (d) import duty drawback can be claimed by any manufacturer, provided that evidence of export performance and importation of raw materials is submitted. 347 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MALAYSIA Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to all countries other than Israel and South Africa may be made without restriction after exchange control requirements have been met. There is no restriction on the amount of foreign exchange made available for travel abroad. Remittances to nonres- idents of dividends, interest, and profits on all bona fide investments are permitted, subject only to the comple- tion of exchange control forms for amounts in excess of M$l0,000. There is no restriction on the export of currency notes by travelers. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Israel and South Africa are totally pro- hibited. Exports of sawlogs above 40 centimeters in diameter from Peninsular Malaysia are prohibited. For sawlogs of 40 centimeters and below in diameter, only those species other than the 27 banned species are allowed to be exported. The customs areas and export control systems between the three territories of Malaysia have been harmonized. Exchange control forms have to be completed and authorized by banks in Malaysia for exports valued at M$5,000 f .o .b. or more (for exports to Indonesia, forms are not required except when exports are valued at more than M$ 100,000). Proceeds from exports must be received according to the timing of payment specified in the commercial contract, but subject to a maximum period of six months from the date of export, either in a specified currency or in ringgit obtained from the sale of a specified currency to a bank in Malaysia. Exports of rubber from Peninsular Malaysia require a certificate issued by the Malaysian Rubber Exchange and Licensing Board. Exports of cement and cement clinker, tiles, bricks, metals of all kinds includ- ing scrap, rice and paddy in whatever form, wheat flour, sugar, milk and specified milk products, textiles, and all other goods as specified in the second schedule of the Customs (Prohibition of Exports) Order, 1978, of the 1967 Customs Act are subject to licensing. Proceeds from Invisibles The exchange control authorities do not regulate exchange receipts from invisibles, but receipts from exports are subject to exchange control. No limitation is imposed on the import of currency notes by travelers. Capital Inward investment covered by the guidelines issued on February 20, 1974 (regarding the acquisition of assets, mergers, and takeovers) requires prior approval by the Foreign Investment Committee. Majority equity partici- pation may be held by foreign firms engaged in export- oriented projects other than those involving the exploita- tion or extraction of nonrenewable resources. (An export-oriented project is defined as one in which 80 percent or more of production is exported.) Full foreign ownership is also permissible, depending on factors such as the level of technology, the spill-over effects, volume of investments, location, value added, 348 and the use of local raw materials and components. A foreign investment application of more than US$5 mil- lion is processed according to the existing procedure; if the foreign investors find the officially recommended foreign equity structure unacceptable, the case can be referred directly to the competent Minister for final determination. The maximum equity stake in a bank is limited to 20 percent for a corporation and 10 percent for an ind iv idua l, including family-owned companies. The proceeds of investments may be repatriated freely on resale, subject to the completion of exchange control formalities for amounts above M$l0,000. Companies in Malaysia controlled by nonresidents are permitted to borrow in Malaysia up to M$500,000 without exchange control approval. The permission of the Controller of Foreign Exchange is freely given for direct and portfolio investment by Malaysian residents in countries other than Israel and South Afr ica. Commercial banks are not encouraged to give loans to finance investments abroad that are considered un l ike ly to contribute to long-term benefits for the economy; such funds should be used to finance the expansion of productive capacity in Malaysia. Residents may borrow freely from abroad sums which are individually less than M$ 100,000; beyond that amount, permission must be obtained from the Control- ler, stating the main terms and conditions of the loan and the purpose for which the loan proceeds would be used. Service payments on approved foreign loans may be permitted by the commercial banks on behalf of the Controller, provided these payments are in accordance with the approved terms and conditions. Commercial banks and merchant banks in Malaysia can lend in foreign currency to residents and accept deposits in foreign currency from nonresidents. Loans in foreign currency by banks in Malaysia must be for business and productive purposes in Malaysia, including (but not exclusively) payment for the import of goods and services, payment of interest or repayment of principal on loans from nonresidents, or payment for the purchase from nonresidents of immovable properties in Malaysia or stocks and shares, provided that, for the purchase of property or shares, (a) the Foreign Investment Commit- tee has given its approval, (b) the amount borrowed does not exceed the equivalent of M$25 million, and (c) repayment of principal will not be made with funds borrowed in ringgit from residents. The approval of the Controller is required for all other foreign currency loans. As an incentive, interest paid to nonresidents by the commercial banks is exempted from payment of the 20 percent withholding tax. Gold Residents of Malaysia are permitted to purchase, sell, borrow, lend, hold, or export gold, provided that the weight of individual bars and wafers does not exceed 100 grams in each case. A traveler may import, on one's own person or in personal luggage, any number of gold coins issued by the Central Bank of Malaysia but only ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution one piece of any other type of gold coin, medallion, bar, or wafer not exceeding 100 grams in weight. The importation of gold is otherwise regulated by specific license issued by the Ministry of Trade and Industry, the policy being to limit such importation to authorized dealers who are required to quote daily buying and selling prices for the wafers that they retail to the public. Changes During 1985 Prescription of Currency May 10. A two-year countertrade agreement with a company in the Republic of South Korea was completed. Capital January 24. Authorization was granted for Singapore businessmen to retain up to 70 percent of the shares in their companies in Malaysia even after 1990 and even if such investment was not export-oriented. Under the New Economic Policy (NEP), foreign investors could own up to 70 percent of equity in a Malaysian company provided that such investment was export-oriented. For companies serving the domestic market foreign share- holdings were required not to exceed 30 percent after 1990. MALAYSIA February 2. In order to encourage and expedite foreign investment, the Government announced a change in the approval system, so that investments of more than US$5 million could be referred to the competent Minis- ter directly for final decision, if the officially recom- mended structure should prove unacceptable to the investor. According to NEP guidelines, a foreign inves- tor could hold up to 30 percent of the equity of Malaysian companies, but with the present flexible approach the permissible equity ratio could vary on a case-by-case basis. April 12. It was announced that the 30 percent limit on foreign investment participation could be extended to a majority holding, provided that such investment was export-oriented, entailed importation of high technol- ogy, or did not involve the exploitation of renewable resources. September 2. Under a new directive issued by Bank Vegara (the central bank) restricting the ownership of banks, the maximum equity stake was limited to 20 percent for a corporation and 10 percent for an individual, including family-owned companies. October 25. As an incentive measure, interest pay- ments to nonresidents by the commercial banks were exempted from the withholding tax of 20 percent. 349 ©International Monetary Fund.

The official exchange rate of the rufiyaa is set by the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) on the basis of a trade-weighted basket of currencies. The midpoint ex- change rate of the ruf iyaa in terms of the U .S. dollar on December 31, 1985 was Rf 7.13 = US$1. Administration of Control There is no exchange control legislation. Trade con- trols are administered by the Ministry of Trade and Industries, which also issues import and export licenses. Prescription of Currency Since January 25, 1982 all local transactions between residents and nonresidents, such as the settlement of tourism bills, must be made in local currency. There are no restrictions on maintaining balances in foreign cur- rency. No bilateral payments agreements are in force. Nonresident Accounts No distinction is made between accounts held by residents and those held by nonresidents; and there are no restrictions on keeping foreign currency balances. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. There are, in general, no restrictions on imports. However, import operations may be conducted only after being registered and licensed at the Ministry of Trade and Industries. Most staple commodities (including rice, sugar, wheat flour, medicines, and petroleum products) are imported by the State Trading Organization. Payments for Invisibles Travelers may freely take out any amount in domestic or foreign currency, without any restriction. Tourist resorts and foreigners other than those working for the Government are required, when paying their taxes and rents, to produce documentary evidence showing that their sales of foreign exchange to the Maldives Monetary Authority are at least suff ic ient to cover such payments. Exports and Export Proceeds Export operations are conducted only after being registered and licensed at the Ministry of Trade and Industries. Export of black coral and tortoise shells is prohibited, except in the form of a product. Export du ty is levied on ambergris exported by a Maldivian, goods exported by a Maldivian jo in t ly with a foreigner, and goods exported by a foreigner; re-exports a n- exempt. Exporters of dutiable goods are required to import goods or foreign exchange equal to the value of the goods 350 exported, w i th in the period of time specified in the license. In the case of duty-free exports, exporters may, upon request by the Government, be required to import specified goods in an amount not exceeding 33 percent of the value of the goods exported; this requirement has, however, not been applied so far. Proceeds from Invisibles Private sector receipts from current invisibles need not be surrendered and may be disposed of freely through the foreign exchange market. Travelers may bring in any amount of foreign currency without restriction. Capital Residents and nonresidents may freely import and export capital through the foreign exchange market, and residents do not require permission to maintain foreign currency accounts at home or abroad. Inward direct investment requires approval. All foreign investors are required to provide at least 75 percent of their capital investment either in the form of cash or in capital goods financed from outside Maldives. Transfers of profits are permitted, and exemptions from taxes other than tourism taxes may be granted for a period of up to ten years. Gold Transactions in gold are not subject to regulation. Residents may freely hold and negotiate gold in any form, at home or abroad, and the import and export of gold are not restricted. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement January 1. The quota arrangement for the sale of foreign exchange by the MMA to individual commercial banks was discontinued. July 1. The Maldivian ruf iyaa was pegged to a trade- weighted basket of currencies, and the midpoint ex- change rate for the ru f iyaa in terms of the U .S. dollar was set at Rf 7 .1 = US$1. In addition, changes were made in the spread between the buy ing and selling rates. Imports and Import Payments February 10.

Not for Redistribution MALI (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Mali is the CFA Franc,1 which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. Exchange rates for all other currencies that are officially quoted on the Paris exchange market are based on the fixed rate for the French franc and the Paris exchange market rate for the currency concerned. The BCEAO levies commissions of 0.1 per mill and 2.5 per mill, respectively, on transfers to or from nonmembers of the West African Monetary Union. The banks also charge a separate commission, a portion of which is transferred to the Treasury. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of measures relating to gold and the repatriation of export proceeds, Mali's exchange controls do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Bur- kina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Cote d'lvoire, Equato- rial Guinea, Gabon, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control The Minister of Finance and Commerce has sole authority in exchange control matters; certain exchange control powers have been delegated to the BCEAO and to authorized banks. The bilateral payments agreement accounts2 are operated by the Development Bank of Mali. Licenses for imports and exports are issued by the Directorate-General of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance and Commerce. Prescription of Currency Settlements on account of transactions covered by bi- lateral payments agreements are made in currencies and through accounts established under such agreements. Since Mali has an Operations Account with the French Treasury, settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the countries linked to the French Treasury by an Operations Account are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any Operations Account country. Settlements with all other countries with which no payments agreement is in force are usually made through correspondent banks in France, in 'The CFA franc is issued by the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de 1'Ouest (BCEAO) and is the common currency in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'lvoire, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo. 2Mali maintains bilateral payments agreements with the People's Republic of China, Hungary, Morocco, Romania, the U .S .S .R ., and Viet Nam. With the exception of those with the People's Republic of China and the U .S .S .R ., these agreements are inoperative. any of the currencies of those countries, or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. Settlements with The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are normally made through the West African Clearing House. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are, in principle, based on those applied in France. The crediting to nonresident accounts, of CFA bank notes, French bank notes, or bank notes issued by any other institute of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury is not permitted, except for BCEAO bank notes mailed direct to the BCEAO Agency in Bamako by foreign correspondents of the authorized banks; such notes may be credited to Foreign Accounts in Francs opened by these correspondents with an authorized bank in Mali. Foreign Accounts in Francs may be debited without prior authorization with BCEAO bank notes mailed directly by authorized intermediaries to their foreign correspondents. Imports and Import Payments The import licensing system introduced in 1977 distin- guishes five categories of imports: (1) imports subject to quotas and requiring an import license (Regime A); (2) imports admitted freely and requiring only an import certificate (Regime B); (3) imports without settlement in foreign exchange (Regime C); (4) imports by govern- ment monopolies (Regime D); and (5) imports subject to special prohibitions for reasons of security, public health, etc. (Regime E). Imports originating in a member country of the West African Economic Community are subject to Regime B; some products from EC countries, such as foodstuffs and other basic necessities not reserved for state monopolies, are also included in Regime B. Other products from the EC countries, such as luxury consumer goods and products that compete with local production, are subject to quota under Regime A, as are all commodities from all other countries. Imports financed directly from foreign re- sources, for example, from grants, foreign investment, or development loans, are admitted virtually freely under Regime C. Specified foodstuffs (including sugar, tea, salt, milk, and canned tomatoes), tobacco products, and fertilizers can only be imported by state agencies designated as monopolies under Regime D. Imports from Israel, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and South Africa are prohibited. Imports are licensed in accordance with an annual import program. A license is valid for six months bu t, if necessary, may be extended for a further period of three months. However, the system is implemented flexibly, and licenses in excess of the program are issued for 351 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MALI justified need or unforeseen circumstances. Imports may be made by either private importers or state enterprises, among the most important of which is the Societe Malienne d'Import-Export (SoMlEX), with its monopoly over basic commodities. An allocation commission establishes quotas for each private importer on the basis of his turnover. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the countries linked to the French Treasury by an Operations Account are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to approval. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are subject to approval. For tourist travel, residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the countries linked to the French Treasury by an Operations Account may obtain an annual exchange allocation equivalent to CFAF 250,000 a person (CFAF 125,000 for children under ten), which may be allotted on several occasions during the year; any unused foreign exchange must be surrendered to an authorized intermediary w i th in eight days after the return to Mali. For business travel, the allocation is the equivalent of CFAF 25,000 a day, subject to a maximum of CFAF 250,000 a trip.3 Residents traveling to foreign countries may take out up to CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO bank notes, or the equiva- lent in Bank of France bank notes, or bank notes issued by other countries linked to the French Treasury by an Operations Account. Nonresident travelers may freely take out foreign bank notes up to the equivalent of CFAF 100,000; higher amounts may be taken out only if declared upon entry. They may also take out CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO bank notes, or the equivalent in Bank of France bank notes, or bank notes issued by other countries linked to the French Treasury by an Operations Account, and any payments instruments drawn up abroad in their name. The transfer of the entire salary of a foreigner working in Mali is permitted upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher, provided that the transfer takes place within three months of the pay period or where there is a reciprocity agreement with the foreigner's country of nationality. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to foreign countries must be recorded with an authorized bank, and all export proceeds, including those originating in France and other countries linked to the French Treasury by an Operations Account, must be 3Exchange for tourist travel purposes is made available only to persons submitting an exit permit (autorisation de sortie} issued by the Security Services. 352 repatriated and surrendered w i th in one month of pay- ment due date or w i th in 90 days from shipment if no payment date is specified in the sales contract. Exports to countries outside the West African Economic Commu- nity require individual licenses; those to countries of the West African Economic Community require only a certi- ficate. The export of cotton and groundnuts is reserved, in principle, for SOMIEX. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the countries linked to the French Treasury by an Operations Account may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries for services and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be collected and surrendered. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BCEAO, the Bank of France, or a bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) of countries outside the French Franc Area. Capital Capital movements between Mali, France (as defined above), Monaco, and the countries linked to the French Treasury by an Operations Account are free of restric- tions; capital transfers to all other countries require authorization from the Ministry of Finance and Com- merce and are restricted, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. Special controls (in addition to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable) are maintained over borrowing abroad, although the Development Bank of Mali is exempt from these controls. The special control measures also do not apply to relations with France (as defined above) and the countries linked to the French Treasury by an Operations Account. Under an Investment Code of March 30, 1976, the Government may grant special privileged status, providing for transfer, tax, and other preferential treat- ment to foreign investments that would be of special interest to the Malian economy and that are compatible with the goals of the Economic Plan. Gold Travelers may export gold jewelry and personal be- longings, other than gold coin and ingots, up to a maxi- mum weight of 500 grams. Commercial imports and exports of gold do not require authorization by the Min- istry of Finance and Commerce but are subject to customs declaration as prescribed by the customs regulations.

Not for Redistribution MALTA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Malta is the Maltese Lira. The va lue of the Maltese lira is determined on the basis of the fixed relationship between the Maltese lira and a trade- weighted basket of currenc ies1 representing Ma l ta 's important trading partners. The da i ly exchange rate between the Maltese lira and the U .S. do l lar, the intervention currency, is derived by adding up the latest dollar values of the currency components of the Maltese lira basket; the midday quotations in Hong Kong are normally used in the computations. In dealings w i th the commercial banks, a spread of 0.125 percent is applied between the buy ing and selling rates for the U . S. dollar. On December 31, 1985 the buy ing and se l l ing rates for the Maltese lira in terms of the U .S. do l lar in such dealings were US$2.3608 and US$2.3578, respectively, per Lm 1. The Central Bank also quotes da i ly rates for various other currencies, inc lud ing the deutsche ma rk, the Italian lira, and the pound sterling, on the basis of the rate for the U .S. dollar and the cross rates for these currencies in the principal exchange markets abroad. The Central Bank 's basic rate (middle rate) for the pound sterling on December 31, 1985 was £ stg. 1.6378 per Lm 1. The commercial banks' rates for currencies not quoted by the Central Bank are based on market rates in Hong Kong. There are no taxes or subs id ies on pur- chases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Exchange controls are administered by the Central Bank, as agent for the M in is ter of Finance; trade controls are administered by the Director of Trade in the M in i s t ry of Trade.

Expenses (other than air or sea fares) defrayed in advance in Malta in connection w i th such trips are counted within the foreign exchange allowance. There is also an allowance for educational expenses abroad of Lm 3,000 a person for an academic year .4 Applications for allowances in excess of these amounts are approved by the Central Bank if it is satisfied that no illicit capital ou tf low is involved. Nonresident travelers may import any amount of foreign currency and may export foreign currency up to the amount brought in by them and declared to the customs on entry. The transfer of profits, dividends, and interest from approved foreign investments requires central bank permission, wh ich is normally given, after compliance w i th certain formalities. Life insurance expressed in Malta currency may be contracted only w i th insurance companies that are du ly licensed as required under the Insurance Business Ac t, 1981. Remittances for the maintenance of dependents abroad are allowed on application showing evidence of hardship. Up to Lm 25 in Maltese notes and coins may be exported by a traveler. Exports and Export Proceeds With the exception of works of art and certain essential goods, all commodities may be exported free ly. However, certain textile products for export to EC countries are subject to licensing. The proceeds of exports must be surrendered within six months of shipment. 4For purposes of exchange allocations for travel and s t u d y, residents are defined as physical persons who are at the time l i v i ng in Malta and either have lived there for at least three years or intend to con t inue l iv ing there for at least three years. 354 Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles must be offered for sale to an authorized bank. Travelers may bring in any amount in foreign currency notes, but w i thout an authorization by the Minister of Finance, importation of any notes and coin that are or have been legal tender in Malta is permitted only up to Lm 50. Capital No control is exercised over capital receipts, although receipts in foreign currencies must be offered for sale to an authorized bank. Payments abroad of a capital nature require prior approval. Applications for outward direct investment by residents and for direct investment in Malta by nonresidents are considered on their merits. The Immovable Property (Acquisition by Nonresidents) Act, 1974, administered by the Ministry of Finance, prohibits the acquisition of immovable property in Malta by nonresidents,5 w i th the exception of certain special cases mainly related to economic development. Applica- tions for the acquisition of property for use as a residence by individuals who do not already hold property in Malta are given favorable consideration. Purchases of personal real estate situated outside Malta require prior exchange control approval. Foreign nationals who take up residence outside Malta normally are allowed to transfer all their assets to their new country of residence. Maltese nationals who emi- grate may transfer abroad up to Lm 7,500 for each fam i ly; any excess amount is normally released three years after the date of departure on application to the Central Bank. Banks, other than those licensed to borrow and lend only outside Malta, are restricted in the acquisition of net foreign assets. Gold Malta has issued 23 denominations of gold coin, which are legal tender. Residents are allowed to hold coin and to acquire jewelry, but they require exchange control permission to purchase and sell any gold coin that is not legal tender. The import of gold coin is controlled to ensure that such coins are genuinely for num isma t ic purposes. A specific import license is re- quired for imports of gold coin, gold bu l l ion, and manufactured or semimanufactured articles of gold; imports of filigree work of gold or silver are prohibited. Subject to exchange control permission, authorized importers may import gold bullion only to supply jewelers and other industrial users. The export of gold by residents other than the monetary authorities also re- quires exchange control permission. Gold bullion and gold coin are free of import du ty. 5For the purpose of this Ac t, the term nonresidents means ( 1) ind iv idua ls who are not residents of Malta; (2) any association of persons, or any en t i ty, whether corporate or not, if (a) it is registered outside Ma l ta, or (b) it has its principal place of residence or of business outside Ma l ta, or (c) 20 percent or more of its share or other capital is owned by a nonresident person, or (d) it is in any manner, whether d i rec t ly or ind i rec t ly, controlled by one or more nonresident persons. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MALTA Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement December 2. The basket of currencies used for determining the exchange rate of the Maltese lira was adjusted to include the Italian lira and the Belgian franc. In addition, the weights of the currencies began to be calculated on the basis of average flows during the three years to mid-1985 in Malta's merchandise trade with its major trading partners, including for the first time, foreign exchange earnings from tourism. Imports and Import Payments September 16. Restrictions on trade with Italy were lifted. Accordingly, subject to the general licensing policy, importation from Italy was liberalized for all commodities and was no longer limited to industrial supplies, spare parts, and essential commodities. Payments for Invisibles September 16. The prohibition, since October 25, 1984, of official foreign exchange sales for tourist travel to Italy was lifted. 355 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAURITANIA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Mauritania is the Mauritanian Ou- guiya. The exchange rate for the ouguiya is determined on the basis of a basket of currencies comprising the Belgian franc, the deutsche mark, the French franc, the Italian lira, the Spanish peseta, and the U .S. dollar. The relative weights assigned to each currency are based on that currency's relative importance in Mauritania's total exchange transactions and are revised from time to time. The opening spot rates of the currencies in the basket against the U .S. dollar on the Paris exchange market are used for determining the ouguiya's daily exchange rate vis-a-vis the U .S. dollar. Daily exchange rates for 14 other currencies,l including the currencies used in the basket, are obtained from the daily reference rate for the U .S. dollar and the cross rates for these currencies in the Paris exchange market. On December 31, 1985 the midpoint exchange rate of the ouguiya in terms of the U .S. dollar was UM 77.07 - US$1. Mauritania confines the official exchange rate for the ouguiya within margins of 4.5 percent; at present, it applies margins of zero percent in respect of exchange transactions. There are no taxes or subsidies on pur- chases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Exchange control authority is vested in the Central Bank and the Minister of Finance and the Ministry of Commerce. The Central Bank has delegated some approval authority to authorized banks. The Central Bank is authorized to obtain any information necessary to compile balance of payments statistics. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be ef- fected through authorized banks or, in some cases, through the Postal Administration. Import and export licenses, where required, are issued by the Foreign Trade Department in the Ministry of Commerce. All import licenses require exchange control approval by the Cen- tral Bank. Prescription of Currency All settlements with Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Settlements w i th other countries usua l ly take place in convertible currencies. Nonresident Accounts There are two kinds of nonresident accounts in domestic currency: Convertible Accounts, which may be credited only with proceeds from the sale of foreign currency or transfers from other Convertible Accounts; 'Aus tr ian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. 356 and Internal Nonresident Accounts, wh ich may be credited w i th domestic bank notes. Convertible Ac- counts may be debited for any payment without central bank approval, but payments to and w i thdrawa ls from these accounts may not be made in foreign bank notes w i thout special approval from the Central Bank. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Israel and South Afr ica are prohibited, and imports of a few goods are prohibited for reasons of health or public policy. Only holders of importer- exporter cards are permitted to engage in import transac- tions. Imports of all commodities must be authorized by the Central Bank. The National Import-Export Corpora- tion (SONIMEX) has a monopoly over imports of sugar, rice, and green tea. A l though there is no formal import program, authorizations can be denied if the vo lume of imports in any period is deemed excessive. Import transactions must be domiciled w i th an autho- rized bank, except in the case of imports "without payment ." Af ter the approval of the Central Bank has been obtained, the import license entitles the importer to purchase the necessary exchange, but not earlier than ten days before shipment if a documentary credit is opened or eight days before the payment is due if the com- modities have already arrived. Advance payments for imports require prior approval by the Central Bank. The Central Bank authorizes only the payment of import b i l ls quoting f .o .b. or c. & f. prices, and all imports must be insured w i th the Maur i tan ian State Insurance and Rein- surance Company (SMAR ). There are special arrange- ments for imports in border areas. Payments for Invisibles Payments to Israel and South A f r ica are prohibited. Payments for invisibles to other countries are subject to the approval of the Central Bank, wh ich has delegated its approval au thor i ty for certain specified paymen ts to authorized banks. Basic exchange allocations have been established for various types of inv is ib les. For tour ist travel, residents may obtain an annual exchange allocation equ iva lent to UM 10,000 a person (UM 5,000 for children under 10 years). For business trave l, the allocations are the equivalent of UM 50,000 a person a trip to Afr ican countries, UM 90,000 to Europe, and UM 120,000 to other destinations; annual limits range from UM 100,000 to UM 800,000, depending on the app l ican t's business turnover. Bona fide requests for higher amoun ts for travel may be granted on a case-by-case basis. The use of all travel allocations must be marked in a personal travel exchange booklet. The transfer of savings from salaries by foreigners working in Maur i tan ia is permitted up to varying percentages, according to marital status. At the end of their stay in Mau r i tan ia, they may transfer all their ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution assets abroad. Travelers are not allowed to take out domestic bank notes. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Only holders of importer-exporter cards are permitted to engage in export transactions. Export transactions to all countries in excess of UM 5,000 must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Exporters must sign an undertaking to repatriate and surrender the foreign exchange pro- ceeds. Exports to all countries require authorization and endorsement by the Central Bank. Export proceeds must be surrendered not later than the due date of the payment, which normally must not be more than 60 days after shipment. Exports of iron ore are the monopoly of the National Industrial and Mining Company (SNIM), and exports of demersal fish are the monopoly of the Mauritanian Fish Marketing Company (SMCP). Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles must be surrendered. All amounts due from nonresidents in respect of services and all income earned abroad from foreign assets must be collected and surrendered within four months of the due date of the payment. The importation of domestic bank notes by travelers is prohibited. Capital Transfers of capital between Mauritania and Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Capital movements between Mauritania and all foreign countries are subject to exchange control; capital transfers to all countries re- quire exchange control approval and are restricted, but capital receipts normally are permitted freely, although the subsequent investment of the funds in Mauritania may require approval, as indicated below. All investments abroad by residents require prior authorization by the Central Bank. Foreign direct invest- ments in Mauritania2 and Mauritanian direct investments MAURITANIA abroad3 must be declared to the Central Bank before they are made. The Central Bank has the right to request the postponement of the projects within 15 days from receipt of the declaration. The fu ll or partial liquidation of inward or outward investment also requires a declara- tion. Both the making and the liquidation of investments, whether Mauritanian investments abroad or foreign investments in Mauritania, must be reported to the Central Bank within 20 days following each operation. Direct investments are defined as investments implying control of a company or enterprise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Mauritania requires prior authorization by the Central Bank, as does borrowing by residents from nonresidents. The Investment Code (Ordinance No. 79046 of March 15, 1979) provides for various benefits for private investments in Mauritania and stipulates that profits and dividends accruing from such investment can be trans- ferred freely. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Mauritania. All imports and exports of gold require prior authorization by the Central Bank. Exempt from this requirement are imports and exports by the Central Bank and manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles). Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement February 14. The ouguiya was devalued by 16 percent vis-a-vis the basket of currencies used for determining its exchange rate. Further devaluations on the same basis were effected on various occasions during the year, leading to a rate of UM 77.07 = US$1 on December 31, 1985. 2Including those made by companies in Mauritania that are directly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in Mauritania of foreign companies. 3 Including those made through foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in Mauritania and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Mauritania. 357 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAURITIUS (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Mauritius is the Mauritian Rupee, the external value of which is determined on the basis of its relationship to a weighted basket of currencies of Mauritius' major trading partners. Buying and selling rates for foreign currencies are quoted by the Bank of Mauritius (central bank) with asymmetrical margins, amounting to 0.125 percent (buying) and 0.25 percent (selling) in respect of exchange transactions in sterling and U.S. dollars, and 0.3125 percent (buying) and 0.625 percent (selling) in respect of exchange transac- tions in French francs, using rates obtained on the basis of the fixed peg to the basket of currencies. On Decem- ber 31, 1985 the buying and selling rates of the Bank of Mauritius were Mau Rs 20.4600 and Mau Rs 20.5367, respectively, per £ stg. 1; Mau Rs 14.2933 and Mau Rs 14.3467, respectively, per US$1; and Mau Rs 1.8733 and Mau Rs 1.8900, respectively, per F 1. Commercial banks are authorized to deal in the French franc, sterling, and the U .S. dollar at rates based on the rates quoted by the Bank of Mauritius for these currencies. Spreads allowed between buying and selling rates of the commercial banks for transactions by telegraphic transfers are up to 1 percent for transactions in pound sterling, 1.5 percent for the U .S. dollar, 2.2 percent for the French franc, 2.5 percent for the Japanese yen, 2.5 percent for the Swiss franc, and 2.75 percent for the deutsche mark. Commercial banks' buying and selling rates for other foreign currenciesl are determined on the basis of appropriate cross rates in the London market and the cost of forward cover in appropriate cases. Forward exchange facilities in sterling and U.S. dollars are made available by the Bank of Mauritius for industries operating in the Export Process- ing Zone and for banks engaged in foreign borrowing for on-lending to the sugar sector. The maximum period for forward cover is six months; the forward rates are based on a uniform margin of 3 percent a year. A stamp duty of 45 percent is applied to outward transfers of capital (other than banking funds and repatriation of foreign investments) and purchases of gold coin and gold bullion. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Bank of Mauritius under powers delegated to it by the Financial Secretary. The authority for approving virtually all current payments is in turn delegated to the commercial banks. The Ministry of Trade and Shipping is responsi- ble for the issue of import and export permits, where required. Prescription of Currency2 Beginning in 1985, Mauritius no longer makes a dis- tinction between sterling and nonsterling areas for pre- scription of currency purposes. Payments to nonresidents may be made in Mauritian rupees from a nonresi- dent account or in any convertible foreign currency. Similarly, payments from nonresidents may be received in Mauritian rupees from a nonresident account or in any convertible foreign currency. Nonresident Accounts External accounts may be opened by residents and firms of other countries and may be credited with (a) authorized payments by residents of Mauritius, (b) any transfers from other external accounts, and (c) the proceeds of sales to an authorized dealer of any convertible foreign currency by nonresidents. These accounts may be debited with (a) any payment to resi- dents of Mauritius, (b) any transfers to other external accounts, and (c) the cost of purchase of any convertible foreign currency or gold. The "Non-Resident (External Account) Scheme," reintroduced on September 25, 1985, is intended to provide Mauritians abroad with incentives to transfer their savings to Mauritius and to open accounts with commercial banks in Mauritius in rupees in the form of savings or fixed deposit accounts and in designated foreign currencies in the form of term deposits with a minimum period of one year. Interest on such deposits is exempted from income tax. As long as they are abroad, holders of such accounts are free to transfer at any time balances held therein, together with interest. Any related exchange risk involved in maintain- ing accounts in designated foreign currencies is borne by the Bank of Mauritius. In addition to the above, there are also Blocked Accounts to which are credited funds owned by persons and firms resident outside Mauritius and realized from investments made by them prior to April 5, 1966, as well as funds representing emigrants' assets in excess of Mau Rs 100,000. Such accounts may be credited with payments by residents of Mauritius that have been specifically authorized for credit to a Blocked Account and may be debited for certain specified transactions. Funds from Blocked Accounts may, with approval, be invested in Mauritius. Upon the realization of such investments, the proceeds are directed once more to a Blocked Account. Imports and Import Payments Importers must be licensed under the Licenses Ordinance. Under the Supplies (Control of Imports) ^he exchange control regulations of Mauritius define foreign currencies as all currencies other than the Mauritian rupee. 2A bilateral payments agreement between Mauritius and Madagascar entered into force on April 1, 1986. 358 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Regulations of 1982, all imports other than goods exempted or prohibited, as specified in the third and fourth schedules, respectively, require import permits from the Ministry of Trade and Shipping; the permits are essentially for statistical and tax purposes. In addition to an import permit, importers must apply for exchange control approval to make the corresponding import payments. Certain imports are subject to customs sur- charges; a stamp duty of 17 percent based on the c . i .f. value is levied on most imports. Importers of goods of lower priority may not avail themselves of suppliers' credits, and local commercial banks are discouraged from extending credit for such imports. The contracting of suppliers' credit of more than 90 days' duration in respect of other categories of imports requires the prior approval of the Bank of Mauritius, except for imports effected by companies holding a development certificate or by companies in the Export Processing Zone. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles related to imports require the prior approval of the exchange control authorities. Foreign exchange for other purposes, such as foreign travel, may be provided up to specified limits by the commercial banks without prior reference to the ex- change control authorities. The basic travel allowance is the equivalent of £ stg. 400 a person for every two calendar years for travel to any country. A 10 percent tax, together with a surcharge of 10 percent thereon, is levied on all air tickets purchased by Mauritian residents for international journeys. The allowance for business travel is the equivalent of £ stg. 50 a day. Applications for exchange for business travel are examined by the Bank of Mauritius. There are established limits for payments and transfers in respect of family support, salary remittances by non-Mauritian nationals, trade commissions, subscriptions to clubs and societies, pub- lishing rights, advertising outside Mauritius, royalties, professional and technical services, education, and leave salaries. Applications for amounts exceeding the stan- dard allocations may be submitted to the exchange control authorities. Residents and nonresident travelers may take out Mau Rs 350 in domestic currency. Resident travelers may take out foreign currency notes up to the amount of their travel allowance. Nonresident travelers may take out any foreign currency declared upon entry. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of (1) articles made wholly or partially of gold, platinum, or silver; (2) diamonds, precious and semiprecious stones, pearls, and articles mounted with these; and (3) works of art are prohibited, unless per- mission is obtained from the Financial Secretary. All exports valued at more than Mau Rs 1,000 and all exports of food products valued at over Mau Rs 50 MAURITIUS require an export permit from the Ministry of Trade and Shipping. Exports of certain foodstuffs, including fru i ts, are controlled. The Mauritius Sugar Syndicate is the sole exporter of sugar. A graduated tax is levied on sugar ex- ports at the rate of 15.75 percent of f .o .b. value for export volume within the range of 1,001-3,000 tons, and 23.625 percent for exports exceeding 3,000 tons. All export proceeds in any currency other than Mauri- tian rupees must be repatriated within six months after shipment, and offered for sale to an authorized dealer. However, permission may be given to large export-import companies to retain export proceeds for a reasonable period of time to meet payments for imports. Exports of knit shirts and sweaters of cotton, wool, and man-made fibers to Canada and the United States are effected under bilateral export restraint agreements. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in any currency other than Mauritian rupees must be offered for sale to an autho- rized dealer. There is no limitation on the amount of foreign currency notes and coin that may be imported, but not more than Mau Rs 700 in domestic currency notes and coin may be imported by travelers. Capital Inward transfers of capital are not restricted. Outward transfers of capital are subject to certain restrictions. Nonbank residents of Mauritius may, subject to permis- sion, transfer a reasonable amount of capital to any country on payment of a 45 percent stamp du ty. Nonresidents also require permission to transfer capital to any country; such transfers are also subject to a 45 percent stamp du ty. Foreign-owned companies may freely transfer abroad dividends, profits, and interest on capital. Permission for repatriation of capital is not granted for capital brought in before April 5, 1966, irrespective of the country of origin. Proceeds from the sale, liquidation, etc., of foreign capital that may not be repatriated must be credited to Blocked Accounts. However, permission for repatriation of capital is nor- mally given for capital brought in on or after April 5, 1966. Repatriation of capital by foreign investors is tax free up to the amount of original investment, but capital gains are taxed at 45 percent. Emigrants may take out, at the official rate of exchange and free of stamp du ty, the equivalent of Mau Rs 100,000 from their Mauritian assets when emigrating to any country; this facility is available upon redesignation as a nonresident, which occurs upon de- parture. The balance of an emigrant's funds must be credited for an indefinite period to a Blocked Account; any releases that may be approved for transfer abroad are subject to payment of the 45 percent stamp du ty. Persons emigrating from Mauritius are not entitled to draw their personal travel allowance in addition to the emigration facilities. 359 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAURITIUS Gold Residents other than the monetary authorities are permitted to hold gold for numismatic purposes (includ- ing commemorative gold coins of Mau Rs 200 and Mau Rs 1,000) or as personal jewelry and ornaments. The import and export of monetary gold are prohibited, except when made by the monetary authorities. Imports of gold for industrial purposes are subject to a quota and specific import permit. Exports of articles made wholly or partially of gold, other than jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler, are prohibited. Payments in respect of private imports of gold coin and gold bullion are subject to the 45 percent stamp du ty. Imports of certain jewelry are subject to temporary customs surcharges. Changes During 1985 Prescription of Currency July 1. The distinction between sterling and non- sterling areas in the application of exchange control regulations was terminated. Nonresident Accounts September 25. The "Nonresident (External) Accounts Scheme" was reintroduced, as a means of attracting for- eign currency deposits from Mauritian nationals abroad. Imports and Import Payments July I. The rate of stamp du ty on most imports was raised to 17 percent. At the same time, exemptions or reductions in customs or stamp duties were announced for computers, bicycles, and f ish ing vessels and motors. In addition, the responsibility for collecting stamp duty on imports was shifted from the Ministry of Trade and Shipping to the Un if ied Revenue Board, although the Ministry remained responsible for the issuance of import permits. Exports and Export Proceeds May 15. The Mauritius Export Development and Investment Authority (MEDIA) commenced operations, charged w i th the responsibility to coordinate information and official clearances for would-be investors, as well as to plan and manage industrial estates. 360 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MEXICO (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Mexico is the Mexican Peso. There are two exchange markets: the controlled market and the free market. The exchange rate in the controlled market is adjusted daily on the basis, inter alia, of the following factors: (a) the demand and supply of foreign exchange in the controlled market; (b) the objective regarding an adequate level of international reserves; (c) the move- ment of domestic and foreign prices; and (d) movements in other exchange rate relationships. Transactions at the controlled market rate include (a) merchandise export receipts (with some exceptions); (b) payments by in- bond industries for wages, salaries, leasings or rents, and the purchase of Mexican goods and services, other than fixed assets; (c) royalties for the use of foreign tech- nologies and patents; (d) payments of principal, interest, and related expenses resulting from financial and sup- pliers' credits by the public and private sector; (e) payments for imports; (f) expenses in relation to the Mexican foreign service and contributions regarding Mexico's membership in international organizations; and (g) other transactions specifically authorized by the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP). Eligi- ble participants in the controlled market may choose to complete the transaction at a retail rate, agreed between participants and the banks, or at the "equilibrium exchange rate," which is determined for the controlled market each day at a fixing session (in the Bank of Mexico) in which representatives of the major banks exchange bids for purchases and sales of foreign ex- change; the Bank of Mexico also may submit bids in these sessions. For amounts exceeding US$50,000, transactors may make completion of the deal contingent on the equilibrium exchange rate achieving a particular m in imum or max imum va lue. On December 31, 1985 the equ i l ibr ium exchange rate in the controlled market was Mex$371.90 per US$1, and the buy ing and selling rates in the same market were Mex$370.80 and Mex$372.20 per US$1, respectively. W i th in the free market no limitations apply to the access to, ownership, or transfer of foreign exchange. On December 31, 1985 the buy ing and selling rates for the U .S. dollar in the free market were Mex$448.50 and Mex$453.00 per US$1, respectively. The Bank of Mexico, through the Trust Fund for the Coverage of Foreign Exchange Risk (FiGORCA) provides foreign exchange for the repayment of certain foreign debt obligations in respect of debt contracted or re- scheduled on a long-term basis w i th foreign financial entities and suppliers. All Mexican credit institutions are authorized to operate in the free market through exchange houses. Mexican banks are prohibited from receiving domestic currency deposits from foreign financial ins t i tu t ions abroad or from non-Mexican exchange houses, except when such funds represent the counterpart of foreign currency sold to a Mexican bank for the purpose of a borrowing operation, or when authorized on a case-by- case basis by the Directorate of International Operations in the Bank of Mexico. On November 12, 1946 Mexico notified the Fund that it was prepared formally to accept the obligations of Article V I I I, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control Foreign exchange policies are established by SHCP and the Bank of Mexico. The exchange control system is administered by the Bank of Mexico through Mexican credit institutions, which carry out most of the transac- tions in the controlled market. Prescription of Currency Apart from the exceptions described below, there are no obligations prescribing the method or currency for payments to nonresidents, neither in the free nor in the controlled market, but obligations deriving from the selling of foreign exchange in the controlled market must be made in the currencies approved by the Bank of Mexico. In accordance with the payments agreements with Argentina, Bo l iv ia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uru- guay, and Venezuela, controlled market payments to these countries must be made through accounts main- tained w i th each other by the Bank of Mexico and the central bank of the country concerned, within the framework of the multilateral clearing system of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA). Similar arrangements exist with Costa Rica, Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Yugoslavia. Imports and Import Payments In line w i th the program to replace import licenses and permits with tar iffs, import licenses from the Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Promotion are required for only 839 of the 8,048 items in Mexico's General Import Tariff. Of the imports to free trade areas, only 442 items are subject to licensing; the exceptions include tempo- rary imports of raw materials and intermediate goods for export production. For the items subject to licensing, applications for import licenses may cover the appli- can t's import needs of six months. Import needs are estimated at 20 percent above previous actual imports but may be increased when ju s t i f ied. New licenses are issued only if the applicant can demonstrate that at least 70 percent of earlier licenses have been effectively used. For some commodities "open-end" import licenses may be granted, allowing imports to be effected during a period of six months to one year, subject to an overall 361 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MEXICO limit. Depending on the importer's performance, the license may be renewed repeatedly. Most import licenses are subject to the payment of a fee of between 1 percent and 17 percent of the value of the import transaction; the proceeds are allocated to a fund handled by the Mexican Foreign Trade Institute (IMCE) for the promotion of exports. Official minimum prices are applied to import items in about 1,207 tariff headings representing about 8 percent of imports in 1984. All imports must be accompanied by an exporter's declaration of shipment. Imports by public entities and governmental agencies are subject to prior approval by the Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Development (SECOFl). Beginning from July 25, 1985, a new import tariff structure is applied, grouping merchandises into ten ad valorem rates ranging from zero to 50 percent. Imports from member states of LAI A are subject to preferential tariffs. A free zone regime is granted for certain regions until June 30, 1991; such a regime allows imports to said zones without duties, as long as the goods are not similar to those of national production in the same regions. Only 442 import items to free trade areas are subject to import licenses. Importers may acquire foreign exchange for the fu ll value of merchandise already imported and for which payment has not yet been made. Importers must register a commitment of use (or devolution) of foreign exchange (CUDD), in effect since April 1984, in order to obtain foreign currency for advance payments; they have a period of 180 days to show evidence of use of the foreign exchange for payment of imports and associated ex- penses or to return said foreign exchange if no adequate substantiation of its use is provided. Beginning from August 6, 1985, advance payment for imports is re- stricted to 20 percent of the value of tools, machinery, and equipment destined to be added to the capital assets of the importing company; supplier's confirmation is required for operations in excess of US$10,000 in value. Beginning from October 9, 1985, advance full payment for all imports is allowed if the value of goods does not exceed US$10,000, or if payment is made through letters of credit; in the latter case, there is a 60-day period in which to show evidence of use of foreign exchange. For an import value exceeding US$10,000, only 50 percent advance payment is permitted. Advance payment for associated expenses is permitted up to maximum autho- rized percentages (6 percent f .o .b. value for North American imports, and 8 percent f .o .b. value for other regions). Supplier's confirmation is required for indi- vidual transactions exceeding US$10,000. Payments for Invisibles Except for the items specified below, payments for invisibles are made through the free exchange market. The payments made through the controlled exchange market consist of: (a) principal and interest on public and private sector debt with foreign financial entities, foreign suppliers, and Mexican banks; (b) fees related to credits 362 from foreign financial entities, up to 3/4 of 1 percent of the total amount of each credit; (c) expenses of the Mexican foreign service; contributions and allotments for Mexico's membership in international organizations; (d) expenses related to foreign trade; (e) royalties and obligations deriving from juridical acts in force as of June 1, 1984 and recorded with the National Registry of Technological Transfer, with payments to be made through authorized Mexican banks; and (f) expenses on account of scholarships granted by the National Council of Science and Technology (CoNACYT) and those ap- proved by CONACYT or the Bank of Mexico, for studies in foreign countries. The contracting of insurance for persons in Mexico, or on property of Mexican ownership, or where the risks are on the account of persons in Mexico, or may occur in Mexico, is permitted only with Mexican companies, except when Mexican firms deem it convenient not to execute such transactions, in which case the prior authorization of SHCP is required. The provisions are not applicable to reinsurance. Exports and Export Proceeds Most exports do not require licenses. Exportation of a few specified items is prohibited. All merchandise export receipts in excess of Mex$ 1,000 a week are subject to export surrender requirements in the controlled market, within a standard period of 90 days. Handicraft exports of up to US$8,000 per operation are exempt from the export surrender requirement. Special procedures apply for the surrender of export proceeds beyond the standard limit of 90 days. Beginning from August 5, 1985, if sale of foreign exchange occurs beyond the required period without authorization, the exchange rate applicable is the lower of (a) the ninetieth day rate in the controlled market, or (b) the rate of the selling day. Exporters of jewelry and precious metals must surrender their pro- ceeds through specifically authorized credit institutions. Exporting enterprises are authorized to open in Mexi- can banks special accounts in local currency; but only proceeds from exports can be deposited in such ac- counts. Interest payable on these deposits is equivalent to the rate of depreciation of the controlled exchange rate against the U .S. dollar plus the corresponding Eurodollar deposit rates. Mexican banks are also authorized to accept deposits in U .S. dollars by Mexican firms and grant loans in foreign currency for the production, shipment, storage, and long-term financing of exports. Such deposits can only be constituted in U .S. dollars and do not earn an interest rate higher than the LIB OR plus 1 percent. Individual deposit accounts under this scheme must be for a minimum of US$5,000, with the exception of deposits made by enterprises in the free trade zones and border areas. Payments are made abroad in foreign currency. Beginning from April 8, 1985, under the Program for Integral Promotion of Exports (PROFlEX), a drawback system of import duty payments by exporters is in operation. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution With effect from June 6, 1985, the Federal Govern- ment provides a facility called "Certificates of the Right to Import Merchandise for Export" (DiMEX), through which exporters with at least 30 percent value added may import, without permit or license requirement, up to 30 percent of the value of their exports; excluded from the scheme are 537 items of the General Import Tariff, representing 21 percent of total imports. Exporters are also eligible to purchase imported inputs at the controlled market rate, as are importers. In addition, they may use their export proceeds to pay for imports, associated expenses, and recorded financial and supplier's debt. Under a three-year understanding on export subsidies and countervailing duties concluded between Mexico and the United States on April 23, 1985, Mexico has been granted the benefit of the injury test in countervail- ing duty investigations, in return for which it has undertaken to phase out export subsidies. Proceeds from Invisibles In-bond industries are required to sell foreign ex- change through the controlled market for the equivalent in Mexican pesos to the payment they make for items specified in the Exchange Control Decree, including payment of wages, salaries, leasings or rents, the purchase of Mexican goods and services other than fixed assets, local and federal taxes, insurance premiums, interest and other accessory payments pertaining to financing payable in Mexican pesos, as well as any other operational expenditure within Mexico. This regime does not apply to foreign exchange earmarked for payment of credits granted to third parties by foreign financial institutions for the construction of buildings, or industrial parks whose use or enjoyment has been granted to such in-bond industries, provided that agree- ment has been made that the amount of the benefits from such use or possession be applied to liquidating the aforementioned credits. In-bond industries must sell their foreign exchange no later than the last business day of the month in which such expenditures are made. In addition, they must present to the Bureau of Customs at the SHCP and the Bank of Mexico, within the first 15 business days of each month, information as to the dates and amounts of foreign exchange sold to the country's credit institutions during the month immediately preceding, as well as the amounts of Mexican pesos they disbursed to pay each of the specified items. In-bond industries must effect these foreign exchange transactions through Mexican credit institutions. Capital Foreign investment, including the transfer of funds relating to increment of capital stock as well as payment of dividends, is excluded from the coverage of the controlled foreign-exchange market. Accordingly, such activities are effected through the free market and not subject to any restrictions, having only to conform to the MEXICO norms contained in the applicable laws and regulations. Loan proceeds repayable abroad in foreign currency and obtained from foreign financial institutions or Mexican credit institutions are channeled through the controlled exchange market, except when said proceeds are used for the servicing of specified long-term external debt or for import payments. The Federal Government has ownership and control over certain strategic areas such as petroleum, basic petrochemical production, radio- active minerals, electrical and nuclear energy, specified mining activities, railroads, mail and banking services, and other activities so stated by Mexican law. In addition, foreign investment is forbidden in the follow- ing activities: insurance and surety bond companies, investment funds, stockbroker firms, money exchange establishments, radio and television, the public transpor- tation system, forestry, as well as any other areas specified as such by the Federal Government. New direct foreign investment must have a majority participation of Mexican capital, except those cases approved by the National Foreign Investment Commis- sion (CNIE). Direct foreign investments in Mexico must be recorded with the National Foreign Investment Regis- try. Applications by foreign individuals or enterprises to acquire more than 25 percent of the capital of a Mexican company require the prior authorization of the CNIE. Under resolutions issued by the CNIE in December 1985 to facilitate inflow of foreign investment, no prior CNIE authorization is required for 100 percent foreign own- ership of investment in in-bond industry stocks for stock acquisition by foreign investors, if as a minimum, 51 percent of such stocks were foreign owned prior to such investment. Gold Goldsmiths or manufacturers may acquire nonmone- tary gold through authorized Mexican credit institutions at the controlled exchange rate for the elaboration of products earmarked for export. There is a value-added tax of 15 percent on sales of nonmonetary gold. Purchases and sales of monetary gold by Mexican credit institutions are exempt from the tax. Monetary gold exports are exempted from foreign exchange surrender requirements, up to a maximum of 200 grams. Gold may be freely bought or sold in Mexico at the free-market exchange rate. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement March 6. The daily rate of depreciation of the Mexican peso in the controlled and free markets was raised to Mex$0.21 per US$1. June 5. New rules for the operation of exchange houses were issued. July 25. The midpoint exchange rate in the controlled market was changed from Mex$233.1 = US$1 to Mex$279.7 = US$1, representing a devaluation of 16.7 percent. 363 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MEXICO August 5. A system of managed floating of the Mexican peso in the controlled market came into effec t, with daily fixing sessions. November 5. The Bank of Mexico issued regulations prohibiting credit institutions from receiving domestic currency deposits from foreign financial institutions or non-Mexican money exchange establishments. Imports and Import Payments March 24. The Mexican authorities modified the program announced in October 1984, with a view to accelerating the process of replacing import licenses w i th tariffs, and so that some 35-45 percent of the value of imports would be exempted from permits before the end of 1985. July 25. As part of a program to liberalize trade, the requirement for import permits was abolished for a large number of items. (The total number of items free from import permit was thus raised to 7,219, or 62 percent of total 1984 imports.) In addition, a new import tariff structure was introduced, with ten rates ranging from zero to 50 percent, and a few remaining items at a tariff rate of 100 percent. (Reflecting similar changes on a number of subsequent occasions, items under 92 addi- tional tariff headings had been exempted from permit requirements by October 28, 1985.) August 6. A regulation was introduced, limiting advance import payments to 20 percent of value for imports of tools, mach inery, and equipment for use as part of the capital stock of the importing company. October 9. Authorization was granted for fu ll advance payment for all imports not exceeding US$10,000 in value or with payment made through letters of credit. (For values exceeding said amount, permissible advance payment was set at 50 percent.) Exports and Export Proceeds April 8. The Program for Integral Promotion of Exports (PROFIEX) came into operation, and a decree was published establishing temporary import programs for exports. April 23. Mexico and the United States concluded a three-year understanding on the use of export subsidies and countervailing duties. April 24. The Mexican authorities promulgated a decree establishing a generalized export drawback sys- tem, under which taxes paid on imported inputs used in the production of exports would be reimbursed. June 6. The Mexican authorities introduced a facility called DIMEX under wh ich exporters would be allowed to import free of permit up to 30 percent of their export proceeds (or a higher percentage, w i th prior authoriza- tion of the Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Promotion); such imports would also be eligible for the reimbursement of import taxes. November 27. Mexico presented its application for membership in the GATT. 364 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MOROCCO (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Morocco is the Moroccan Dirham. The Bank of Morocco fixes buy ing and selling rates for the French franc daily on the basis of variations in the value of the currencies of Morocco's principal trading partners, weighted in accordance w i th the geographic distribution of Morocco's foreign trade and the pattern of currencies of settlement. Buy ing and selling rates for most other currencies quoted in Morocco1 are established on the basis of the daily dirham-French franc rate and the cross rates for those currencies in relation to the French franc in the Paris exchange market. On December 31, 1985 the exchange rate for the French franc was DH 1.27454 buy ing and DH 1.27836 selling, per F 1. On the same date, the exchange rate for the U .S. dollar was DH 9.5966 buy ing and DH 9.6459 se l l ing, per US$1. A special premium, called the "fidelity premium," is paid by the banks on remittances by Moroccans working abroad. The value of the prem ium, wh ich varies from bank to bank, depends on the foreign currencies con- cerned and on changes in the exchange rate of the dirham in relation to such currencies. All sales and purchases of foreign currency are centralized in the Bank of Morocco, but the authorized banks are permitted to offset purchases and sales on behalf of private customers in each currency separately. Each day authorized banks must purchase from or sell to the Bank of Morocco the balances of their purchases and sales in each currency; transactions are effected at rates fixed by the Bank. Compensation between banks is not permitted, so that no foreign exchange market exists in Morocco. The Bank of Morocco also establishes buy ing and selling rates for transactions w i th travelers in bank notes, traveler's checks, and letters of credit denomi- nated in "convertible currencies" (the currencies listed in footnote 1, including the French franc but exc lud ing the Tunisian dinar) and specified other currencies;2 the authorized banks sell to the Bank of Morocco their excess holdings of bank notes and replenish them at the Bank when necessary. A forward foreign exchange cover facility was established by the authorities effective June 1, 1979; the facility is available for exports as well as imports of items benefiting from special customs arrangements. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Exchange Office, an agency under the Ministry of Finance. This 'Austrian sch i l l ings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Kuw a i ti dinars, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Saudi Arabian riyals, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, Tunisian dinars, U .A .E. dirhams, and U .S. dollars. 2CFA francs, F inn ish markkaa, and G ibra l tar pounds. Office has delegated the execution of certain exchange control measures to authorized banks. Import certificates and export licenses are issued by the Ministry of Commerce; they must be countersigned by the Exchange Office. Import commitments for liberalized goods are signed by the importer himself; they do not require the visa of the Exchange Office unless the country of origin of the goods is not the country of shipment, or the goods are bought on a c . i . f. basis. A part of the port of Tangier is designated as a free trade zone and is exempt from taxation and from trade, customs, and exchange controls. Prescription of Currency For prescription of currency purposes, countries are classified as follows: (1) the payments agreement group, comprising countries w i th which Morocco ma in ta ins bilateral payments agreements;3 and (2) all other coun- tries, the "area of convertibility." Certain noncommercial settlements with Algeria are made in dirhams or Algerian dinars through special accounts at the two central banks; all settlements w i th Tunisia are made through accounts denominated in convertible dirhams or Tunisian convertible dinars. Imports originating in countries in the area of converti- bility may be paid for only in "convertible currencies" negotiated by the Bank of Morocco. Other settlements w i th countries in the area of convertibility may be made only in convertible currencies negotiated by the Bank of Morocco or through Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dirhams. Nonresident Accounts The various types of nonresident accounts are as follows: 1. Foreign Currency Accounts are held by physical or juridical foreign nationals, either resident or nonresident. These may be freely credited w i th book transfers from abroad, w i th checks, traveler's checks, or any other means of payment denominated in foreign currency, except foreign bank notes, and w i th foreign currency drawn from the Bank of Morocco following general or special authorization by the Exchange Office. They may be freely debited for book transfers abroad to the account holder or to a third party foreign national, for the surrender of foreign currency to the Bank of Morocco, or for the payment of checks denominated in foreign currency. 2. Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dirhams are reserved for physical or jur id ical persons of foreign nationality, who may be resident or nonresident. These accounts may be credited freely w i th authorized pay- ments due to residents of countries in the area of 3Gu in ea and Ma l i; howeve r, these agreements are inoperative. 365 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MOROCCO convertibility and with dirhams obtained from the sale to the Bank of Morocco of convertible currencies, exclud- ing bank notes.4 They may be debited freely for payments in Morocco and for purchases from the Bank of Morocco of convertible currencies. Transfers between Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dirhams may be made freely. The interest rate payable on these deposits is fixed at a minimum of 10 percent a year and is not subject to the withholding tax of 10 percent on interest earnings. 3. Payments Agreement Accounts are held by the Bank of Morocco for central banks (or similar institutions) of the countries with which Morocco maintains bilateral payments agreements (see footnote 3); they are used only for settlements with these countries, including set- tlements for imports and exports. 4. Capital Accounts, which may be held by any nonresident, are credited with funds that may not be transferred abroad. These include the proceeds from the sale on the Casablanca Stock Exchange of foreign or Moroccan securities without retransfer guarantees and proceeds from the contractual or accelerated redemption of securities quoted on the Casablanca Stock Exchange and lacking retransfer guarantees. Transfers between Capital Accounts related to countries in the area of convertibility or the same country in the payments agreement group are permitted freely. Capital Accounts may be debited freely for purchases of specified govern- ment bonds and for personal expenses of the account holder and his immediate relatives during visits to Morocco (subject to a limit of DH 15,000 a year for each account), as well as the settlement of taxes in Morocco owed by the account holder. All other operations through Capital Accounts require individual approval. 5. Suspense Accounts are used for holding nonresident funds not available for credit to any of the accounts mentioned above. Balances on these accounts may be used freely to pay taxes due in Morocco, and up to DH 15,000 a year, to pay the costs of the stay in Morocco of the account holder, the spouse, or other immediate relatives; but all other debits to these accounts require approval. 6. Two Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dirhams are held by the Bank of Morocco for the Central Bank of Tunisia and the Central Bank of Mauritania; at present, only the account of the Central Bank of Tunisia is operational. Imports and Import Payments Imports are admitted in accordance with an annual General Import Program, divided into three categories and applicable to all countries. Goods in List A may be imported freely. Goods in List B are restricted, in some cases by a global quota, or are subject to state trading; for a large number of List B items, no quotas are established, and imports are approved according to need, 4The Exchange Office may, however, authorize a foreign account to be credited in convertible dirhams w i th the dirham proceeds from the surrender of foreign bank notes, upon presentation of the original customs declaration. 366 licenses usually being issued upon application (SB items). In principle, the importation of goods in List C is not permitted; among the items on this List are certain motor vehicles, certain precious metals, and gold jewelry. To import goods in List A, the importer signs an import commitment (engagement a" importation), which does not require administrative approval unless the goods are imported from a country other than that of origin or are purchased on a c . i . f. basis;5 but for goods in List B, an import certificate (autorisation d"importation or certificat d'importation) must be obtained. Cereals, sugar, tea, and fertilizers are imported by official agencies. For all imports the import title —import certificate or import commitment —must be domiciled (registered) with an authorized bank, which may make payments upon submission of the required documents. Import certificates require the visa of the Exchange Office before the foreign exchange is made available. Import commitments require this visa only when the country of origin and the country of shipment of the goods concerned differ or when imports are contracted for on a c . i . f. basis. Special procedures are applicable to specified imports financed by foreign aid or loans. At the time the import transaction is domiciled with an autho- rized bank, a stamp duty of DH 50 is levied on import transactions valued at DH 2,000 or more. Most imports from countries in the payments agree- ment group are made in accordance with quotas estab- lished in the respective trade agreements. Imports can also be licensed under compensation transactions. Payments for Invisibles Payments for most current invisibles require the approval of the Exchange Office, but in several instances the approval authority has been delegated to the banks. The authorized banks are permitted to make payments and settle expenses incidental to the commercial transac- tion covered by the relevant import or export documents. Earnings after tax on approved nonresident investments in Morocco are transferable to the investor's country of residence. The transfer of dividends on nonresident- owned shares of Moroccan companies listed on the Casablanca Stock Exchange and having their main office in Morocco is unrestricted; dividend transfer by unlisted companies requires the approval of the Exchange Office. Undistributed profits relating to the financial year 1968 or later remain transferable indefinitely. Some payments are subject to limitations. A foreign employee may transfer to the employee's country of origin, subject to the initial approval of the Exchange Office, 50 percent of his monthly wages or salary if the spouse does not reside in Morocco, or 30 percent if the employee is single or his family lives in Morocco; teachers attached to the Ministry of National Education are allowed an additional transfer of 35 percent for 5C . i . f. imports of List A goods require prior exchange control approval. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 30 days leave taken abroad, 70 percent for 60 days leave, and 105 percent for 70 days leave. For the medical or paramedical professions, the assessment of transferable amounts (30 percent or 50 percent, according to whether the spouse lives in Morocco) is based on taxable income minus applicable duties and taxes. The same applies to other liberal professions as well as to persons engaged in industry, trade, agriculture, and crafts, except that the monthly transferable amount may not exceed DH 2,500. For retired persons the calculation of the transferable amount (30 percent or 50 percent) is based on net pensions. An allocation of foreign exchange equivalent to DH 100 a person a year is granted to residents of any nationality for travel abroad, provided that they do not make periodic transfers abroad. There is a special allocation for pilgrimages. Residents of foreign national- ity may acquire exchange for tourist travel up to the equivalent of DH 2,500 a year for each passport by selling to an authorized bank a corresponding amount in foreign exchange (other than bank notes) from their own foreign assets not subject to surrender requirements. Foreign exchange allocation up to the equivalent of DH 1,200 a month is granted to foreign nationals residing in Morocco to cover the cost of higher education for a child studying abroad. A special tax of DH 100 a person is levied on Moroccan or foreign residents traveling abroad, with the exception of pilgrims, students, emigrant workers, and those traveling on official business. For business travel a standard allowance of DH 750 a day is granted, up to DH 7,500 a person a trip and within an annual ceiling fixed individually by the Exchange Office; exporters and professional members of the tourist industry may obtain up to DH 1,000 a person a day, up to DH 15,000 a trip, within a ceiling of 3 percent of the foreign exchange repatriated during the preceding calendar year. The allocation issued for business travel may be added to the allocation issued for tourist travel. Moroccan students pursuing higher studies at the first and second level abroad who do not hold scholarships may obtain monthly allocations of foreign exchange up to a maximum of DH 2,400, and doctoral students who do not hold scholarships may obtain up to DH 2,700. There is also a quarterly allocation of DH 3,600 as a supplement for scholarship students. Students are granted an annual installation allowance fixed at DH 4,000. The export of Moroccan bank notes is prohibited. Workers leaving Morocco to work abroad for the first time may be granted DH 2,000 in foreign bank notes upon presentation of an employment contract. Exports and Export Proceeds Most exports may be made freely, although export licenses are required for a few items. All fruits, fresh vegetables, raw cotton, and cotton by-products may be exported only either directly by the producers or through a state-trading agency, the Office of Marketing and Export (Office de Commercialisation et d'Exportation — OCE), which is also in charge of wine exports. MOROCCO All exporters must sign an undertaking to repatriate and surrender foreign exchange proceeds. The surrender to the exporter's bank must take place within one month from the date the payment is due. The date on which the payment is due is the maturity date fixed in the com- mercial contract; in principle, this date must not be set more than 90 days after the date of arrival of the merchandise at the place of destination. When the exporter's bank receives the advice of credit in foreign currency from abroad, it must surrender the foreign exchange immediately to the Bank of Morocco. Proceeds from Invisibles Residents of Moroccan nationality and Moroccan companies must repatriate exchange receipts accruing from all their noncommercial claims and surrender them to an authorized bank. Other residents must surrender noncommercial receipts only if the receipts result from current transactions. Moroccans working abroad must surrender such currencies w i th in one month of re-entry, but are permitted, when leaving again, to repurchase 15 percent of the amount surrendered. A special pre- mium, called the "fidelity premium," is paid by the banks on remittances by Moroccans working abroad. The importation of Moroccan bank notes is prohibited. Nonresident travelers may freely bring in foreign bank notes and traveler's checks; foreign currency imported in excess of the equivalent of DH 5,000 mus t, however, be declared to the customs authorities. Resident travelers also may bring in foreign bank notes in any amount, but these must be surrendered within 30 days of re-entry. Capital Residents of Moroccan nationality, as well as compa- nies established in Morocco, are obliged to declare to the Exchange Office all foreign-held assets exceeding DH 250 and to repatriate and surrender certain of these assets. The disposal of other foreign-held assets requires permission. The transfer of capital abroad by residents must be approved. Remittance of the assets of emigrants and transfers in the form of gifts is not normally approved, nor is investment by private individuals in foreign securities or real estate. Exchange allocations for the transfer of inheritances are limited to DH 35,000 a beneficiary. Permissible transfers of assets by resident foreigners on final departure vary with the length of stay, from DH 10,000 a year for a stay of up to 9 years, DH 150,000 for a stay of 10 to 14 years, DH 250,000 for 15 to 24 years of stay, and DH 500,000 when the period of residence exceeds 24 years. Also for departing resident foreigners, capital accounts with a balance on January 1, 1985 of not more than DH 30,000 are fu l ly transferable (a regulation operational from May 1, 1985 through December 31, 1985), and suspense accounts with a balance on February 6, 1981 not exceeding DH 10,000 are fu l ly transferable, provided that the bank furnished the Exchange Office with supporting informa- tion on the accounts by June 30, 1981. 367 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MOROCCO A new industrial investment code, wh ich came into force in February 1983, provides for f u ll foreign own- ership of Moroccan companies, and an easing of repatri- ation of capital; it also grants fiscal and other incentives for foreign investment. In add i t ion, an investment code introduced for the tourist sector in August 1983 offers tax and other incentives to domestic and foreign inves- tors on most arrears in the tourist sector; it also provides for fu ll repatriation of tourist-related profits after tax, w i thout any restraint on t im ing. Operations through Capital Accounts that may be effected with approval include purchases on the Casa- blanca Stock Exchange of Moroccan and non-Moroccan securities; purchases of Moroccan securities not quoted on the Casablanca Stock Exchange or participation in a Moroccan firm; subscriptions to either; investments of any k ind, including purchases of businesses or office bu i ld ings; lending to residents; payment of local ex- penses in excess of DH 15,000 du r ing the account holder's stay in Morocco; any such payments to beneficiaries other than the holder of the account or a close relative; any such payments from an account held by a foreign juridical person; g i f ts to social, cu l tu ra l, or religious institutions; subscriptions to capital increases of Moroccan companies whose shares are quoted on the Casablanca Stock Exchange; subscriptions at the time of issue to long-term or short-term fixed yield securities issued by a Moroccan public en t i ty; custody charges and commissions on securities; and payment of the cost of maintenance, repairs, real estate taxes, and insurance on real estate located in Morocco. Subject to approval, Capital Accounts may also be debited for investments in Morocco, w i th in the framework of the 1973 Investment Code, provided that the amounts debited do not exceed 50 percent of the investment undertaken by the nonresi- dent and 25 percent of the company's total capital. Certain government bonds acquired w i th funds from Capital Accounts are freely negotiable between nonresi- dents. These are 5.5 percent, seven-year bonds and 6 percent, five-year bonds on which interest and redemp- tion proceeds are transferable. All other transactions in securities involving nonresident interests, as well as the import and export of securities, require approval. Banks are permitted to engage in short-term borrowing abroad; they may accept convertible currency funds from nonres- idents for credit to Special Deposit Accounts, provided that these funds are reinvested abroad in the same currency and for the same maturity period. The rate of interest paid by banks on these deposits may not exceed the rate received by them on their corresponding placements. Gold Commemorative gold coins with a face value of DH 250 and DH 500 have been issued and are legal tender. Residents may purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in Morocco for numismatic or investment pur- poses. Ten different types of foreign gold coins are traded on the Casablanca Stock Exchange, wh ich does 368 not, however, deal in gold bars. Imports of gold are subject to authorization by the Directorate of Customs and Indirect Taxes. Each year the M in is try of Finance fixes a quota for the importation of gold ingots, which is then allocated among jewelers and industrial users of precious me ta ls. Gold jewe lry is included in import List C. Exports of gold are proh ib i ted. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement The exchange rate of the Moroccan dirham was adjusted by small margins on numerous occasions during the year; in terms of the French f ranc, the change was from a middle rate of DH 0.99575 = F 1 on Decem- ber 30, 1984 to DH 1.27645 on December 31, 1985. Imports and Import Payments January 1. W i th in the context of the new budget, Law No. 4.84 was issued, reducing from 10 percent to 7.5 percent the special tax on imports. February 11. Certain aspects of the General Import Program were l ibera l ized, inc lud ing the transfer of a large number of goods from List C to List B and from List B to List A; as a resu l t, only seven items remained on List C.

The exchange rate of the metical in terms of the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, is fixed daily on the basis of quotations for the U .S. dollar and the other currencies in the basket. Exchange rates for 20 other currencies2 are also published daily by the Bank of Mozambique. Buy ing and selling rates are set such that the spread between the buy ing and the selling rate is 2 percent. On December 31, 1985 the buy ing and selling rates for telegraphic transfers in U .S. dollars were Mt. 41.167 and Mt. 42.007, respectively, per US$1. A special buying rate of Mt. 20.0 per rand is applicable to South African rand receipts from Mozambican miners working in South A f r ica .3 With this exception, there are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control With the assistance of Central and provincial govern- ment agencies, the National Planning Commission pre- pares annually a foreign exchange budget for the following year, as part of the Central State Plan. Imports and exports are authorized by means of licenses, within limits and on the basis of priorities established in the foreign exchange budget. Foreign exchange transac- tions, including the surrender of foreign exchange proceeds, are effected through the Bank of Mozambique, which is both the central bank and the only commercial bank with external banking functions. Prescription of Currency Mozambique has bilateral payments agreements w i th Tanzania and the German Democratic Republic. Nonresident Accounts Foreigners living in Mozambique can hold foreign exchange accounts in the Bank of Mozambique and national currency accounts in any bank operating in the country. There is no restriction on the use of these accounts.

Imports and Import Licensing All imports are subject to licensing. In accordance with their objective, enterprises authorized to operate in foreign trade can license themselves for transactions within the limits of the Central State Plan. The license specifies the place of embarkation or disembarkation of the goods and amount and currency of payment. Other enterprises may obtain licenses from the Ministry of Foreign Trade, which considers applications on a case- by-case basis. Imports of raw materials, parts and spare parts, petroleum, food, and medicines are given priority. Individuals may obtain import licenses w i th in certain limits, for customs clearance purposes only, when drawing on the country's Foreign Exchange Fund is not involved. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles are processed by the Bank of Mozambique upon presentation of the authorization granted by the Ministry of Finance. Travel allocations are made available to individuals only for medical reasons. Each Ministry receives an allocation to be used for business travel and educational travel expenses. Foreign experts working in Mozambique may remit abroad a percentage of their salaries, depending on the salary level. Nonresidents may export foreign bank notes up to the amount declared on entry. Exports and reimports of domestic currency are limited to Mt. 500 a person leaving the country temporarily, to meet inciden- tal expenses on returning. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports are subject to licensing. Export licenses are granted if applicable legal requirements are fu l f i l led. Under a new foreign exchange administration system, enterprises or sectors may retain a variable percentage of their foreign exchange proceeds for their purchases of imported inputs. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles must be surrendered to the Bank of Mozambique. Capital The Government and the Bank of Mozambique are authorized to borrow abroad. All foreign borrowing is channeled through the Bank of Mozambique, wh ich ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MOZAMBIQUE registers and guarantees such transactions. A Foreign Investment Law, published on August 18, 1984, aims to encourage the participation of foreign capital both in the formation of new enterprises with exclusively foreign capital and in investments in existing enterprises. There is a Foreign Investment Promotion Office in the Planning Commission. The Investment Law specifies guarantees to investors as well as the right to transfer a portion of profits and invested capital abroad. The incentives for foreign investments include tax and customs exemptions for specified periods of time and access to domestic credit. Gold There are no legal limitations on gold acquisitions. Imports of gold jewelry or other precious metals are governed by special regulations. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement August 1, September 1, and October 1. The special buying rate for inward remittance of South African rands from Mozambican miners in South Africa was changed to Mt. 30, Mt. 25, and Mt. 20, respectively, from a level of Mt. 40 per rand before these changes. 371 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NEPAL (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Nepal is the Nepalese Rupee, the exchange of wh ich f luc tua tes on the basis of a real effective currency basket w i th in margins of 1 percent on either side of the index value. On December 31, 1985 the official buying and selling rates were NRs 20.60 and NRs 20.80, respectively, per US$1. Buy ing and selling rates are quoted daily for certain other currenc ies ,l w i th quotations based on the buy ing and selling rates for the U .S. dollar in markets abroad. Buy ing rates only are quoted for Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Italian lire, and Swedish kronor, based on buy ing rates for the U .S. dollar in markets abroad. Residents may freely purchase Indian rupees from Nepalese banks, and they may hold any amount of Indian notes and coin. The Nepal Rastra Bank guarantees free and unlimited conver- tibility between Indian and Nepalese rupees; however, Indian rupees are not legal tender in Nepal. Administration of Control Permission is required from the Ministry of Finance for all payments in convertible currency except for import payments and certain other specified payments. Import and export licensing is the responsibility of the Ministry of Commerce and Supply. All exchange trans- actions with countries other than India must be settled through authorized dealers, that is, the Nepal Bank L td ., Nepal Arab Bank, and the Rastriya Banijya Bank, which has 387 branches. Within Nepal there are 179 additional authorized dealers licensed to purchase foreign curren- cies; any sale of such currencies other than Indian rupees is subject to the prior approval of the Nepal Rastra Bank. Prescription of Currency No prescription of currency requirements apply to outgoing payments to countries with which no payments agreement is in force ,2 and these may be made in foreign currency supplied by the Nepal Rastra Bank. Payments to, and receipts from, member countries of the Asian Clearing Union (ACU) other than India (Bangladesh, Burma, Islamic Republic of Iran, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) in respect of current transactions should be effected through the ACU. Payments for imports from India normally are settled in Indian rupees, but the Nepal Rastra Bank sometimes makes convertible currencies available f or such imports on the recommendation of the Ministry of Finance. The proceeds of exports to India are obtained in Indian rupees, while proceeds from other countries must be received in any of the quoted convert- ible currencies.

E l ig ib i l i ty for the opening of such accounts is limited to (a) Nepalese citizens earning convertible foreign currency from emp loyment in inter- national organizations, agencies, or embassies; (b) Ne- palese citizens earning foreign currency by working abroad or pursu ing any vocation there (except in India and Bhu tan) for more than six months; (c) international organizations and foreign nationals; and (d) Ind ian and Bhutanese citizens residing in countries other than Nepa l, Ind ia, or Bhu tan. Current or time deposit ac- counts can be opened, the latter for periods of three months, six months, nine mon ths, or one year. Current accounts may be opened w i th a m i n im um of US$1,000 (or the equ iva len t), and time deposits w i th a m in imum of US$5,000 (or the equ iva len t). Up to 70 percent of the deposits can be w i thd rawn in foreign currency, and the balance in Nepalese rupees at the prevailing exchange rate. For deposit purposes on ly, four other currencies (Swiss francs, French francs, Japanese yen, and deutsche mark) may be exchanged for either of the two eligible currencies at the prevailing o f f ic ial exchange rate. Nonresident Accounts The Nepal Rastra Bank permits nonresidents to open "convertible rupee accounts" w i th Nepalese banks; bal- ances on these accounts may be freely transferred abroad. Accounts in Indian currency may be opened only under special arrangements. Foreign currencies brought into or received in Nepal by nonresidents, wh ich are converted into Nepalese rupees and deposited w i th a Nepalese bank, may be reconverted for transfer out of the coun try, subject to prior permission of the Nepal Rastra Bank. Imports and Import Payments Imports from India do not require import licenses. All other imports of goods require import licenses. Imports of industrial goods such as cigarettes and matches, goods considered ha rm ful for hea l th, arms, ammun i t ion and explosives, wireless transmitters, precious metals and jewelry (except under baggage ru le ), and beef require special permission of the Government. Imports of beef are banned, as are imports of wash ing soap (except from India) and detergent powder. Under the Trade and Transit Treaties, Nepal and India have agreed to freedom of trade between themselves in Nepalese and Ind ian goods; Indian goods may, in pr inc ip le, be imported freely (although some are subject to a permit system in order to prevent their re-exportation, and certain others are subject to export ceilings in Ind ia ); reimbursement of ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution tax is made by the Government of India to the Govern- ment of Nepal on direct imports from Indian manufactur- ers of commodities subject to excise duty in India. Imports of certain commodities (e.g., fertilizers, ce- ment, petrol, diesel, b i tumen, ju te patching oil, raw wool, cotton, industrial machinery, stainless steel, wrist watches, synthetic yarn, radios, pocket calculators, video sets, photographic equipment, and other specified goods) from countries other than India are subject to quantitative restrictions. License fees are imposed as follows: imports of certain items subject to quotas (including fertilizers, cement, certain petroleum products, raw wool, cotton, and industrial machinery) are subject to a fee of 1 percent of import license value. Fees of 5 percent, 10 percent, and 25 percent are required for other industrial and construction materials, essential consumer goods, and luxury items, respectively. Margin deposits are required as follows on import letters of credit for commercial imports: 10 percent for imports of industrial raw mate- rials, machinery, and spare parts under the World Bank loan program; 30 percent for imports of development and construction materials such as cement, iron and iron rods, and corrugated sheets; 40 percent for imports of dairy products, writing paper or newsprint, agricultural goods, and educational and scientific materials; 50 per- cent for other goods other than luxury goods; and 75 percent for luxury goods. Nepalese citizens returning from abroad, who have spent at least seven nights out of the country, are allowed to bring in goods worth NRs 2,000, free of customs duties and sales taxes. In addition, they can import, without license but subject to customs duties and taxes, goods worth up to NRs 15,000 twice a year. For those who have official sources of foreign exchange earnings and have stayed more than one month abroad, additional imports are allowed. Payments for Invisibles Payments to India may be made freely in Indian rupees; the purpose of the payment must be declared. For travel to countries other than India for medical treatment, foreign exchange is allowed as recommended by a panel of doctors; students studying at their own expense in these countries are allowed up to the required foreign exchange for board and lodging on the recom- mendation of the Department of Education, while pay- ments for tuition fees are allowed as required. Additional foreign exchange up to US$200 is allowed for inciden- tals, if the stipend is inadequate. Foreign exchange is made available for certain business trips but is restricted for tourist travel abroad. Payments for other invisibles depend on the essentiality of the transaction. Nepalese and Indian currencies may be taken out freely to India but only by Nepalese and Indian nationals; the export of these currencies to countries other than India is pro- hibited. Foreign bank notes, other than Indian bank notes, may not be taken out by residents without permission. Nonresidents may take out the unchanged NEPAL amount of any foreign bank notes they brought in; however, nonresidents, other than Indian nationals, may not take out Nepalese or Indian bank notes.

The re- export to India of non-Nepalese goods is not permitted, and re-export to any destination of goods imported from India is prohibited. With specified exceptions, gocds of Nepalese origin may be exported freely to India. All exports to other destinations, except handicrafts, woolen goods other than carpets, hessians, and ju te bags, dry ginger, cardamom, cheese, catechu, rice bran cake, medicinal herbs, turmeric and rice bran, and processed skins require export licenses. The exchange proceeds from exports, except Indian rupees, must be surrendered to the Nepal Rastra Bank or to an authorized bank within six months of the date when the goods crossed the customs frontier.

Foreign investors who have obtained an investment guarantee are eligible for outward remittances in respect of the following items: all or part of the sales proceeds of investment, dividends, interest or principal repayment, amounts arising from the transfer of technology, and compensations on acquired assets. In cases of proceeds of investment sales and dividends, remittances may be subject to installments fixed by the Government. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form in Nepal. Imports of gold are banned, except under bag and baggage rules. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement July 9. The Ministry of Finance imposed revenue stamp duties on personal purchases of foreign exchange at the rates of NRe 0.15 per 10 Indian rupees, and NRs 3 per U .S. dollar (or the equivalent in other currencies). The revenue stamp duty on purchases of Indian rupees was not implemented. August 9.

Though accounts could be opened only in U.S. dollars or pounds sterling, for deposit purposes, four other currencies— Swiss francs, French francs, Japanese yen, and deutsche mark—could be exchanged for either of the above two currencies at the prevailing official rates of exchange. Current accounts could be opened with a minimum of US$1,000 or the equivalent, and time deposits with a minimum of US$5,000 or the equivalent. Account holders could withdraw up to 70 percent of their deposits in foreign currency for imports or travel purposes; 30 percent of withdrawals should be made in Nepalese rupees at the prevailing rates of exchange. November 30. The exchange rate of the Nepalese rupee was changed from NRs 17.50 to NRs 20.50 per U .S. dollar and from NRs 1.451 to NRs 1.70 per Indian rupee. In addition, the revenue stamp duty on purchases of foreign currency introduced in July 1985 was abol- ished, together with the 10 percent export subsidy introduced in November 1983. 374 November 30. The Nepalese rupee was devalued from NRs 1.45075 per Indian rupee to NRs 1.70075 per Indian rupee, and from NRs 17.50 = US$1 to NRs 20.50 = US$1. Administration of Control September 2. The eighth meeting of the Indo-Nepal Inter-Governmental Committee decided to continue, until the next meeting, the prevailing transit facilities between the two countries. Imports and Import Payments January 9. The margin deposit requirement for the opening of import letters of credit by registered business firms within the cottage industries and small industrial projects sponsored under the World Bank loan programs was reduced from 30 percent to 10 percent of the f .o .b. value of imports of industrial raw materials, machinery, and their spare parts. (If a bank considered it necessary to impose a higher margin on the basis of the importer's creditworthiness, an additional margin in the form of noncash collateral could be required.) March 15. By a decision of the National Insurance Company of India, third country goods transported to Nepal through India became subject to a uniform insurance fee of 0.25 percent of f .o .b. value on all kinds of third country goods transported to Nepal via India, with effect from April 1, 1985; previously, fees varied by product. March 22. The existing Indo-Nepal transit treaty, which was due to expire on March 24, was extended on an ad hoc basis for a period of six months. April 20. The Governments of India and Nepal agreed to extend through 1985 India's quota system on Nepalese imports from India. June 11. The Nepal Rastra Bank instructed the commercial banks to charge 19 percent interest instead of the prevailing rate of 17 percent on import financing loans. In addition, the margin deposit requirement on letters of credit for imports of luxury goods was raised from 50 percent to 75 percent. July 15. In a modification of existing regulations, the Ministry of Finance announced that any Nepalese traveler who had spent at least seven nights abroad was entitled to bring in goods worth NRs 2,000, free of customs duty and sales tax; such a traveler was also entitled to import goods worth NRs 15,000 without license, but subject to custom duty and tax. (Previously, Nepalese citizens returning from abroad were allowed to import personal effects valued from NRs 3,000 to NRs 13,000, depending on the duration of their stay abroad free of license, customs duties, and sales taxes.) Such eligibility could be exercised twice a year; for the third time, persons returning from abroad on government business were entitled to exemption from customs duty and sales tax of up to NRs 850 and NRs 150, respec- tively. Additional facilities were granted to those who had official sources of foreign exchange earnings abroad, ©International Monetary Fund.

In the interest of ju te growers and traders, authorization was granted to export "tossa" variety of ju te during the fiscal year without quantitative restric- tions. (On October 7, 1985, exports of "sada" (ordinary) variety of jute were similarly authorized without restriction.) September 30. The Eighth Indo-Nepal Inter- Governmental Committee broadened the range of basic duty-free access for Nepalese manufacturers to the Indian market: while eligible Nepalese manufactured goods were defined previously as those containing not less than 80 percent of Nepalese (or Nepalese and Indian) materials, the new regulation reduced this pro- portion to 60 percent. November 30. The cash subsidy scheme for exports was withdrawn. 375 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NETHERLANDS (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Netherlands is the Netherlands Guilder. The Netherlands participates w i th Be lg ium, Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Luxembourg in the exchange rate and intervention mechanism of the European Monetary Sys- tem (EMS). In accordance w i th this agreement, the Netherlands maintains the spot exchange rates between the Netherlands guilder and the currencies of the other participants within margins of 2.25 percent (in the case of the Italian lira, 6 percent) above or below the cross rates based on the central rates expressed in European Currency Un i ts (ECUs). The agreement implies that the Netherlands Bank (the central bank) stands ready to buy or sell the currencies of the other participating states in un l im i ted amounts at specified intervention rates. On December 31, 1985 these rates were as follows: ^ifioH in^r^n t i™ Netherlands Guilders Rates Per: Upper limit Lower l im it 100 Belgian or Luxembourg francs 100 Danish kroner 100 deutsche mark 100 French francs 1 Irish pound 10,000 Italian lire 5.7535 31.7325 115.235 37.58 3.5600 17.61 5.5005 30.3375 110.1675 35.925 3.4030 15.62 The participants in the EMS do not maintain exchange rates for other currencies within fixed limits. However, in order to ensure a proper func t ion ing of the system, they intervene in concert to smooth out f luc tua t ions in exchange rates, the intervention currencies being each other's and the U .S. dollar. The authorized banks quote buying and selling rates for 15 foreign currencies.1 On December 31, 1985 the authorized banks' buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were f. 2.77075 and f. 2.77325, respectively, per US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Authorized banks are freely permitted to buy and sell convertible and inconvertible currencies, both spot and forward; they are free to deal w i th residents and nonresidents, whether banks or nonbanks. Forward exchange contracts are not limited as to delivery period, nor is an underlying transaction required. Residents are free to conclude spot transactions with other residents, and they may conclude forward transactions with autho- rized banks for any period.

Nonbank residents are free to hold foreign currency accounts in the Netherlands. The Kingdom of the Netherlands formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from February 15, 1961. Exchange Control Territory Transactions with the Netherlands Antilles are subject to the same exchange controls as transactions with other countries. With regard to any third countries with which payments agreements might be in force, the Netherlands and the Netherlands Antilles w i l l, if so stipulated, constitute the Netherlands Monetary Area. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Netherlands Bank on behalf of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Economic Affa irs, and Agriculture. Import and export licensing, including transit trade,2 is handled by the Central Import-Export Agency (CDIU) and the delegated offices, under directives from the Directorate- General for Foreign Economic Relations. For their payments to and receipts from nonresidents in the Netherlands, residents are generally required to use the intermediation of banks or other domestic institutions or persons authorized by the Netherlands Bank to handle these exchange transactions within the scope of the regulations based on the External Financial Relations Act 1980 (see section on Capital, below). To facilitate the compilation of the balance of payments, residents are required to indicate on reporting forms, for all payments to and receipts from nonresidents exceeding f. 5,000, the nature of the under ly ing transaction as well as the currency and amount paid or received. Separate regula- tions govern the reporting of settlements where no transfer of money is involved. Residents are free to open and maintain bank accounts abroad and to maintain current accounts abroad for the purpose of settlements. The Netherlands Bank must be notified of such accounts, and entries in them are to be reported to the Bank in accordance with the related regulations. Prescription of Currency In effecting payments to nonresidents or collecting receipts from them, residents may make use of guilders or any foreign currency. Payments in any foreign currency between residents may be made freely. There are no bilateral payments agreements in force.

Not for Redistribution with authorized banks in the Netherlands in guilders or any foreign currency, and to effect payments to, or collect receipts from, residents. All current payments or receipts are freely permitted, as well as transfers of balances to and from other nonresident accounts. Some capital payments, however, are subject to license from the Netherlands Bank (see section on Capital, below). Imports and Import Payments Import licenses are required for imports originating in Hong Kong, Japan, and state-trading countries,3 as well as for the importation of goods of unknown origin. In addition, import licenses are required for a limited number of products, mainly those of the agricultural, steel, and textile sectors. Except for imports of textiles originating in the Far East and in state-trading countries (see footnote 3), most imports that require an import license are free from quantitative restriction. Most imports from Eastern European countries are formally liberalized. Imports from non-EC countries of most products covered by the Common Agricultural Policy of the EC are subject to import levies that have replaced all previous barriers to imports; common EC regulations are also applied to imports from non-EC countries of most other agricultural and livestock products. Payments for imports may be made free ly, provided that the method of payment conforms to the relative exchange control regulations. Payments for Invisibles Payments abroad for invisibles are permitted freely. Residents may take out any amount in foreign and domestic bank notes and coin or documents of value for travel purposes; these may be used for traveling expenses abroad, as well as for purchases for wh ich payment in cash is customary in the trade concerned. Payments for interest, dividends, and contractual amortization due to nonresidents are permitted freely. Nonresidents may export all unutilized documents of value for travel purposes, as well as foreign and Netherlands bank notes and coin that they have imported or have obtained in the Netherlands by drawing on their accounts or by exchanging other currencies. Exports and Export Proceeds Export licenses are required for only a few com- modities, mostly of a strategic character, and for some agricultural products, iron and steel scrap and related products, and certain nonferrous metals. Residents may freely grant credit in respect of exports of commodities. The surrender of export proceeds is not obligatory. 3State-trading countries are defined for th is purpose as consisting of A lban ia, Bu lga r ia, the People's Repub l ic of Ch ina, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Repub l ic, Hunga ry, the Democratic People's Repub l ic of Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Roman ia, the U . S . S .R ., and Viet Nam. NETHERLANDS Proceeds from Invisibles There are no requirements attached to receipts by residents from current invisibles. Nonresidents may bring into the Netherlands for travel purposes any amount of foreign bank notes and documents of value; these may be used for traveling expenses in the Nether- lands, as well as for purchases for which payment in cash is customary in the trade concerned. Capital Exchange control in the Netherlands is based on the External Financial Relations Act 1980. This Act limits potential restriction to capital transactions, except when current payments and capital transactions are interwo- ven, as in payment intervals relating to trade trans- actions. Most external capital transactions are unrestricted. The main capital transactions of nonbank residents still subject to case-by-case review are long-term lending ( i .e ., with a maturity of at least two years) to nonresi- dents exceeding f. 10 million a year to the same nonresident. Direct investment in the form of capital participations (inward and outward) is free of license. Short-term lending (for less than two years) to nonresidents (whether affiliated companies or others) is free of license, as is longer-term lending, up to f. 10 million a calendar year to the same nonresident; larger amounts are normally permitted on application. Public issues on the domestic capital market on behalf of nonresidents are subject to the issues calendar and, if necessary, limited by the Netherlands Bank, in accor- dance with the market's capacity to absorb issues. In the private placement sector of the capital market (the market for onderhandse leningen), where mainly institu- tional investors act as lenders, a queue system for nonresident borrowers is used as well, to ensure orderly market conditions. Transactions between residents and nonresidents in all stocks and bonds listed on the Amsterdam Stock Ex- change take place at official market exchange rates and are unrestricted. Residents may freely purchase officially listed securities abroad. Placement with residents of unlisted foreign debentures denominated in guilders (such as foreign Euroguilder notes) is subject to license, bu t, usua l ly, the license is automatically granted as part of the authorization for credit institutions to manage such a placement. Transactions in unlisted stocks are free of license. Nonresidents may have their securities, domes- tic or foreign, exported to them; securities held in the Netherlands are not subject to deposit. Nonresidents may freely purchase real estate in the Netherlands for personal use or investment, and resi- dents may freely purchase real estate abroad. Extension of payment and mortgage borrowing from nonresidents within the framework of such transactions are free of license. Gifts and donations to nonresidents are free. Emi- grants may export any amount in foreign and domestic 377 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NETHERLANDS currency. They acquire nonresident status upon leaving the Netherlands and may upon departure have remitted to them their total assets in the Netherlands. Nonresidents inheriting from estates in the Netherlands may have the proceeds transferred to them freely. There are no restrictions on commercial banks' spot external positions. Banks must pursue a policy to ensure that open positions in foreign currency and precious metals in excess of normal banking limits are avoided. In this context, the banks are required to report in each foreign currency and precious metal their spot position, their forward position with residents and nonresidents, as well as their positions resulting from foreign currency and precious metal options at the end of each month; for deutsche mark, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, and U .S. dollars, the same data must also be reported at mid- month. Moreover, copies of all forward exchange contracts with nonresidents are forwarded to the Nether- lands Bank. Authorized banks may freely extend foreign currency loans to nonresidents as well as short-term guilder loans (i .e ., for less than two years); for longer- term guilder loans a license is required if they exceed f. 10 million a calendar year to the same nonresident (bank or nonbank). The banks' freedom to accept deposits from nonresidents and to borrow abroad is unrestricted. All capital transfers by nonbank residents, whether free or permitted under license, must be notified to the Balance of Payments Department of the Netherlands Bank. This includes suppliers' credits granted or re ceived for periods in excess of one year. Totals of security transactions must be reported periodically by securities brokers and authorized banks or, if transac- tions take place through a foreign bank account, by the resident parties concerned. Gold The Netherlands Bank engages in gold transactions only with monetary authorities and international f inan- cial institutions. Neither the Bank nor any government agency imports or markets gold for industrial use. Authorized banks and nonbank residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold (f ine gold, gold coin, and gold alloys) in the Netherlands or abroad. Imports and exports of gold do not require exchange licenses or import and export licenses. There is a free gold market in Amsterdam. Except for transactions of the Netherlands Bank, transfers of gold in bars and other elementary forms are subject to a value-added tax of 5 percent, as are domestic sales of gold coin. All other gold transac- tions are taxed at 19 percent. Commercial imports of gold jewelry and of articles containing minor quantities of gold, such as watches, require import licenses only when originating in Hong Kong, Japan, or state-trading countries (see footnote 3). Changes During 1985 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 378 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NETHERLANDS ANTILLES1 (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Netherlands Antilles is the Netherlands Antillean Guilder, which is pegged to the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, at NA f. 1.7900 = US$1. The official buy ing rates for the U .S. dollar on December 31, 1985 were NA f. 1.77 per US$1 for bank notes and NA f. 1.79 per US$1 for drafts, checks, and transfers. The official selling rate was NA f. 1.81 per US$1. The Bank of Netherlands Antilles (the central bank) deals with commercial banks at NA f. 1.80 per US$1; it does not normally deal with the pub l ic. Official buy ing and selling rates for certain other currencies2 are set daily on the basis of rates for the U .S. dollar abroad. There is an exchange tax3 of 1.30 percent on sales of foreign exchange.4 Administration of Control Exchange licenses, where required, are issued by the central bank. Import licenses, where required, are issued by the Department of Economic Affairs. The commer- cial banks are permitted by the central bank to provide foreign exchange for almost all current transactions without prior approval. Prescription of Currency Payments may be made in any currency except Netherlands Antillean guilders. Receipts may be ac- cepted in any convertible currency except Netherlands Antillean guilders. All payments made by residents to nonresidents, as well as all receipts through the autho- rized banks, must be reported to the central bank. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents may freely open nonresident accounts in any foreign currency. Nonresidents are permitted to hold nonresident accounts in Netherlands Antillean guilders only if the authorized bank concerned considers that they have certain interests in the Netherlands Antilles that render such an account desirable; balances in such accounts may not exceed NA f. 10,000 without central bank approval. Imports and Import Payments Payments for permitted imports may be made freely.

Certain commodities are subject to import surcharges in Aruba (see footnote 1), Bonaire, and Curasao. Payments for Invisibles For most types of current invisibles remittances may be made freely through the authorized banks. A license is required for certain special transactions; such licenses are granted when no capital transfer is involved. The basic foreign exchange allowance for foreign travel by a resident is the equivalent of NA f. 200 a day, w i th in an annual limit of NA f. 10,000; amounts beyond these ceilings require a special license. Nonresidents may take with them on departure any foreign currency that they brought in on arrival. The export of Netherlands Antilles bank notes is limited to NA f. 200 a person. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports do not require licenses. Exchange proceeds must be surrendered to an authorized bank w i th in six months of shipment. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange receipts from invisibles must be surrendered to an authorized bank. Travelers may bring in with them any amount of checks, traveler's checks, or bank notes denominated in foreign currency. Capital Foreign investment in the Netherlands Antilles re- quires a license, which is normally granted. Outward flows of resident-owned capital are subject to control. Investment by residents in real estate situated abroad is normally permitted. Investment in officially listed foreign securities is generally permitted, provided the securities are registered abroad in the name of an authorized bank. Institutional investors are subject to special supervision with respect to foreign investments. Authorized banks' overall position w i th relation to nonresidents is subject to limits set by the central bank, and mus t, in any event, be positive. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in the Netherlands Antilles. Authorized banks may freely negotiate gold coin among themselves and with other residents. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the central bank; such licenses are not normally granted. Changes During 1985 Payments for Invisibles January 27. The basic foreign exchange allowance for foreign travel by a resident was reduced from the equivalent of NA f. 400 to the equivalent of NA f. 200 a day, within an annual limit of NA f. 10,000. 379 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NEW ZEALAND (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of New Zealand is the New Zealand Dollar. The New Zealand authorities do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions; exchange rates are determined on the basis of demand and supply conditions in the exchange market, but the Reserve Bank of New Zealand retains discretionary power to intervene in the foreign exchange market. On December 31, 1985 the closing buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were US$0.4990 and US$0.5000, respectively, per $NZ 1. The trading banks and authorized foreign exchange dealers are free to adjust exchange rate quotations in response to market conditions throughout each business day. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. On August 5, 1982 New Zealand formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. The trading banks and authorized dealers are per- mitted to conclude with their customers forward ex- change contracts to buy or sell foreign currencies in exchange for New Zealand dollars, irrespective of the purpose for which the funds are required or the source from which they are obtained. These forward contracts may be either for a fixed term or for optional delivery dates. The Reserve Bank does not maintain margins in respect of forward exchange transactions. Authorized foreign exchange dealers are free to set their own rates of forward transactions with their customers. Administration of Control Following the relaxation of exchange control regula- tions in December 1984, receipts and remittances of foreign exchange are free from controls. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand continues to administer the remaining exchange control provisions, which are as follows: (a) foreign exchange dealers must be authorized by the Reserve Bank; (b) all foreign exchange transac- tions must be handled by a trading bank or an authorized foreign exchange dealer; (c) for statistical purposes, except for small amounts, memoranda of receipt and remittance are still required for receipts of foreign exchange from overseas and for remittances of external payments; and (d) information required for the purposes of prudential supervision of foreign exchange dealers and the foreign exchange market must be provided to the Reserve Bank. The Overseas Investment Commission administers the regulations governing foreign direct investment in New Zealand. Export and import licensing is the responsibility of the Customs Department and the Department of Trade and Industry, respectively. Prescription of Currency Payments to and from residents of countries other than New Zealand may be made or received in any foreign 380 currency. * Payment to and from New Zealand currency accounts held with banks in New Zealand by banks not domiciled in New Zealand is also an acceptable form of payment. Nonresident Accounts Overseas banks' accounts in New Zealand may be used for the settlement of transactions with other countries. Imports and Import Payments Imports are controlled through an Import Licensing Schedule. The import categories included in the schedule are as follows: The "Exempt" category covers virtually all primary products (other than wheat), most raw materials and components (e.g., base chemicals and fertilizers), goods that are not made in New Zealand, and some consumer goods. Also exempt are a small but growing range of specified goods of Australian origin as defined under the terms of the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations and Trade (ANZCERT) Agree- ment that came into force on January 1, 1983; there are a limited number of general exemptions. With the excep- tion of a few specified products, imports from the Pacific Islands2 under the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement (SPARTECA) are free of licensing and duty requirements. On a value basis, about 82 percent of all private imports are exempt from licensing. The "Basic" category comprises items for which licenses are granted by reference to either the amount of licenses issued or the actual value of imports in a previous licensing period. Goods covered by this category are generally consumer goods and a range of materials for use in manufacture, and licenses issued are intended to provide some opportunity for import compe- tition. The "Special" category covers a wide range of commodities, including most manufactures, for exam- ple, machinery and appliances, ships, and motor vehi- cles. Special category licenses are granted on an indi- vidual basis and on such criteria as availability of domestic alternatives and price; they are not auto- matically reissued in future licensing periods. The overall administration of the system has been eased over the recent past, with licenses for inputs being made more generally available to export-oriented indus- try, to encourage rationalization of production and greater cost containment within industry generally. An increasing number of import licenses are being issued under a tender system covering a wide range of goods. Tendering is intended to provide a means of 'Foreign currencies are defined as all currencies other than New Zealand currency. 2The islands under this arrangement are those constituting the South Pacific Forum (in addition to Australia and New Zealand), Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Nau ru, N iue, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuva lu, Vanua tu, and Western Samoa. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution moving away from the historical basis of license alloca- tion and has been adopted for allocating additional licenses under a number of industry development plans3 and some licenses under the ANZCERT Agreement. Tendering is also applied to allocate additional global licenses. Most licenses issued may be used to import from any source; the main exceptions to this are licenses under special schemes and agreements such as the developing countries' handicraft scheme, the special trade license scheme, and the ANZCERT Agreement. The majority of licenses are freely transferable between importers. "No-remittance licenses" for goods controlled under the Import Licensing Schedule may be issued in special circumstances, for example, for advertising material supplied free of charge, gifts, passengers' baggage, replacement of faulty or damaged goods, trade samples supplied free of charge, and temporary imports. Eligible imports from developing countries that have not graduated beyond a specified threshold are accorded preferential tariff preferences under the Generalized System of Preferences. In addition, duty-free access is granted to all imports from 36 countries classified as "least developed" by the United Nations. Payments for Invisibles The trading banks and other authorized foreign ex- change dealers are permitted to sell foreign exchange for invisible payments; and the remittance abroad of divi- dends, interest, profits, and other forms of contractual obligation to nonresidents may be freely made, although in both cases there is a reporting requirement for statistical purposes. An international departure tax of $NZ 25 a person aged 12 and over ($NZ 5 for children over 2 but under 12) is payable on all tickets obtained in New Zealand for departure from New Zealand, except for certain promotional, cultural, or educational travel. This tax is administered by the Customs Department. Exports and Export Proceeds There is no requirement for obligatory return of export earnings (including foreign currency earned for perform- ing services in New Zealand for foreign nationals) through the banking system. General export licenses, valid for five years, are issued to regular exporters. Particular export licenses, as required, are issued to new exporters or to those who do not export on a regular basis. Certain items classified as strategic goods may be exported only when specific requirements have been met and an export permit has been issued. The Government encourages efforts to raise the level of exports from New Zealand, particularly nontraditional exports. Three new export incentive schemes were NEW ZEALAND introduced on April 1, 1980 to replace existing incen- tives: (1) the Export Performance Taxation Incentive (EPTI),4 an incentive related to the sale of goods and services (including tourism) and based on a firm's net foreign exchange earnings; (2) the Export Market Devel- opment Taxation Incentive (EMDTI), designed to en- courage the development of export markets; and (3) the Export Programme Suspensory Loan Scheme, an alter- native to the EMDTI designed to encourage firms to undertake more thorough and coordinated marketing programs than is the case under the EMDTI. Govern- ment policy provides for the phased elimination between 1985 and 1987 of all performance-based export incentive schemes. To facilitate export competitiveness, import licenses can be issued to manufacturing exporters for materials and components where it is established that equivalent goods available from domestic sources have price or other characteristics that jeopardize export performance. Bonus import licenses are available to manufacturers who have exported manufactured goods in which li- censed imported raw materials and components have been used. Proceeds from Invisibles Remuneration for services provided or to be provided in New Zealand for overseas residents by New Zealand residents (including corporate bodies ordinarily resident in New Zealand) and interest and dividends earned overseas from portfolio investment is not required to be repatriated. The disposal overseas by New Zealand residents of foreign income from other invisibles such as interest and dividends is permitted, and the foreign currency pro- ceeds may be sold to a New Zealand bank. Travelers may bring into the country unlimited amounts of foreign and domestic bank notes and coin. Capital With the exception of capital issues outside New Zealand, consents are not required in respect of capital receipts. All overseas entities seeking to establish them- selves in New Zealand must obtain the approval of the Overseas Investment Commission. Nonresident persons or companies wishing to make a direct investment in a New Zealand company through the purchase or ex- change of shares are required to obtain the consent of the Overseas Investment Commission in respect of any proposed offer for such shares whenever the investment would confer on the offerer the beneficial entitlement to 25 percent or more of any class of shares, or enable the offerer to exercise 25 percent or more of the voting power at any general meeting. 3Under a plan announced on December 12, 1984, import tariffs on completely knocked-down car packs and bu i l t-up trucks are to be phased out over a period of four to five years starting from January 1, 1985; for import access for bu i l t-up vehicles the tariff is to be increased gradually, up to 17.5 percent of domestic production by 1988. 4The liberalization measures announced by the New Zealand authorities on August 15, 1984 included decisions that (a) the EPTI would be phased out between April 1, 1985 and April 1, 1987, and (b) the ongoing review of other forms of export assistance would be continued, with a view to completing it as soon as possible. 381 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NEW ZEALAND Residents are permitted to purchase foreign exchange for investment purposes, through a trading bank or an authorized foreign exchange dealer. Emigrants may transfer abroad their entire assets upon their departure from New Zealand. Remittance abroad of legacies from the estate of a New Zealand resident is freely permitted. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coin in New Zealand without restriction. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than gold coin and jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler require licenses issued by the Customs Department; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. Commercial imports of gold jewelry are licensed restrict! vely. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement March 4. The practice of establishing a fixed ex- change rate with respect to a trade-weighted basket of currencies was discontinued. The exchange rate for the New Zealand dollar was to be determined henceforth on the basis of conditions of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, although the Reserve Bank of New Zealand reserved the right to intervene on a discretionary basis. Imports and Import Payments July 1. The allocation of import licenses for the 1985/86 licensing year was set at 100 percent in volume terms (105 percent in value), compared with the previous year's levels, and authorization was granted for free transfer of licenses between importers. In addition, a threshold was adopted above which countries could no longer qua l ify for preferential treatment under the Gener- alized System of Preferences; and duty-free access for all products was extended to the 36 least-developed coun- tries (as defined by the United Nations). July 4. It was announced that the application of preferential tariffs on imports from Brunei and Singapore would be terminated. September 9. It was announced that licenses issued under the tendering system would be increased by 5 percent, to cover imports from January 1, 1986. In addition, from July 1, 1986, licenses for all items with average premiums of 7.5 percent or less in the previous two years would be issued freely on demand. September 16. It was announced that import licensing would be substantially phased out by 1988 for those goods not covered by industry development plans. Exports and Export Proceeds March 31. A number of export suspensory loan schemes were terminated. April 1. The subsidy under the Export Performance Taxation Incentive was reduced by 50 percent. Capital October 3. The requirement for consent from the Overseas Investment Commission for New Zealand companies to borrow in overseas markets and the formal limitation on overseas persons borrowing money or issuing share capital in New Zealand were abolished. 382 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NICARAGUA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement1 The currency of Nicaragua is the Nicaraguan Cor- doba. Nicaragua maintains a multiple exchange rate system consisting of an official exchange rate of C$28 = US$1, a "free" market rate administered by an authorized exchange house on the basis of supply and demand, and several special fixed rates. On Decem- ber 31, 1985 the buying rate on the free market was C$750 = US$1. In addition, there is an unrecognized parallel market in which the value of the cordoba fluctuates widely (around C$1,000 per U .S. dollar in December 1985). Only the Central Bank, the authorized commercial banks, and the authorized exchange house can buy and sell foreign exchange; transactions outside the banking system and the authorized exchange house are prohibited. Foreign currency-denominated accounts can be opened in the banking system. Nicaragua accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2 , 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, on July 30, 1964. Administration of Control The exchange control system is administered by the Central Bank. The Central Bank has the sole authority to buy and sell foreign exchange, but has authorized commercial banks and an exchange house to make foreign exchange transactions. However, the Central Bank approves all foreign exchange transactions in the official exchange market. All requests for official foreign exchange are subject to a comprehensive system of administrative rationing. Requests relating to low- priority imports and invisible payments are routinely rejected. The Central Bank is also responsible for classifying imports and for issuing export authorizations. Exchange licensing in the official exchange market is fully integrated with import licensing. There are four stages for the approval of requests for purchase of foreign exchange from the banking system for imports: The first stage involves the screening by the pertinent sectoral ministry, which determines the consistency of a foreign exchange request with the development prior- ities; this process takes one to seven days. The second stage, which usually takes a week, pertains to the screening by the Technical Commission on Exports and Imports (CTIE), which ensures that requests approved by each sectoral ministry are within their exchange budget allocation. The third stage refers to the screening 'On February 1, 1986 the official exchange rate was adjusted from C$28 = US$1 to C$70 = US$1, representing a devaluation of 60 percent. The new official rate would be applied to receipts from traditional exports, import payments, and specified invisibles. In addition, different mixtures of exchange rates were introduced for a number of individual transactions, involving a set of different implicit exchange rates. by the Ministerial Commission on Foreign Exchange, composed of the President of the Central Bank and the Ministers of Finance, External Trade, and External Cooperation; this commission, which meets once every one or two weeks, seeks to assure consistency between the global demand and supply of foreign exchange. The last stage relates to the final approval by the Central Bank Commission on Foreign Exchange Allocation (CAD), which performs a final check on the require- ments of the first three stages and on the actual availability of foreign exchange and has a final veto on requests for foreign exchange. A representative of the President of the Republic may participate in meetings of the CAD. Importers using their own foreign currency accounts are not required to go through the four-stage process of approval, but they are required to show proof of sources of funds and are subject to an annual limit of US$10,000 unless higher amounts are specifically authorized by the Central Bank. Prescription of Currency There is no prescription of currency, but the customs authorities have the power to prohibit an export if the currency stipulated for payment is not readily convertible into U .S. dollars in international markets. Payments to Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras with respect to trade and invisibles may be settled in Nicara- guan cordobas through the Central American Clearing House; however, for compensation through the Central American Clearing House, there are monthly limits on bank notes per exporter: (1) 100,000 Salvadoran colones for El Salvador, (2) 200,000 Guatemalan quetzales for Guatemala, and (3) 50,000 Honduran lempiras for Honduras. Imports and Import Payments All importers through the official foreign exchange market are required to be registered with the Ministry of External Trade; this requirement can be waived for individuals who import only occasionally for their own needs and who make import settlements with foreign exchange obtained in the official market. There are several categories of registered importers: (1) the Empresa Nicaraguense de Insumos Agropecuarios, which has a virtual monopoly on imports of agricultural inputs; (2) the Empresa Nicaraguense de Importaciones, which imports capital goods for the People's Property Area (APP) enterprises (both being state enterprises under the supervision of the Ministry of External Trade); and (3) commercial and industrial importers, including border traders. Border traders are given a general license to import or export up to the equivalent of US$1,500 a month (at the free market rate). In principle, general import licenses are valid until the end of the calender 383 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NICARAGUA year in which they are issued, but the Central Bank may limit the validity of licenses in certain cases to only 60 days. For individual imports other than imports financed with own foreign-currency deposit accounts or with foreign exchange from the free market, a specific permit is required. Importers must initiate their application with the pertinent sectoral ministry. Applications with the higher priorities are then submitted to the Technical Commission for Imports and Exports for further screening. Screened applications are submitted to the Ministerial Commission on Foreign Exchange for ap- proval and subsequently to the Central Bank Commis- sion for Foreign Exchange Allocation for a final decision. Only authorized imports are eligible for official foreign exchange; these include basic food products, medicines and medical equipment, petroleum and its derivatives, agricultural machinery, spare parts, and tools, and public transportation equipment. Imports can also be financed with the use of own foreign-currency accounts up to a limit of US$10,000 a year, unless higher amounts are specifically authorized by the Central Bank, or from the free exchange market. Payments for imports from the Central American region must be effected by bank check or certified check in cordobas, authorized for conversion through the Central American Clearing House. Payments for imports from outside the Central American region must be settled through the banking system.2 Payments are usually made with sight drafts, but letters of credit are generally used for imports from Japan. Central Bank approval is required to open letters of credit; the banks are not permitted to sell foreign exchange before the arrival of the import documents. Imports are not released from customs unless evidence is submitted that either payment or acceptance of payment has been made through a bank. In the latter case, the Central Bank must also approve the credit terms, but this requirement does not apply to duty- free imports from member countries of the Central American Common Market. The Central Bank may authorize deferred payments or payment with funds derived from properly authenticated credits obtained abroad, usually for imports of raw materials and capital goods intended for priority development. Under the provisions of the Central American Agree- ment on Fiscal Incentives, Nicaragua grants duty exoner- ations on imports of raw materials and capital goods to approved industrial firms. Most imports originating from outside the Central American Common Market are subject to an import surcharge of 30 percent of the applicable import du ty .3 In addition to custom duties, many nonessential imports are subject to a special import 2However, by virtue of Decree No. 1-L (effective March 1, 1963), the exchange proceeds from bananas, coconuts, copra, and coconut by- products exported through the ports of the region of El Cabo and the Department of Zelaya may be used by the exporters to pay for imports consumed in these areas. 3The 30 percent surcharge was eliminated on January 1, 1986. 384 duty of C$3 per US$1, and many essential imports, to a special import duty of C$2 per US$1. Certain imports are also subject to a selective consumption tax, irrespec- tive of origin. In addition, most commodities, whether imported or domestically produced, are subject to a 10 percent general sales tax. Payments for Invisibles All sales of foreign exchange by the banking system for payments of invisibles must be authorized by the Central Bank. Foreign exchange for certain invisible payments can be purchased from the exchange house at the free market rate, or can be financed from the use of own foreign-currency deposit accounts. Holders of foreign currency-denominated accounts with the domes- tic banks may use those accounts up to US$10,000 a year for payments of invisibles, unless higher amounts are specifically authorized by the Central Bank. Resident travelers are not allowed to take out more than US$500 in foreign bank notes at any given time, and may not take in or out of the country more than C$5,000 a month in domestic bank notes. There are arrears on interest obligations of the public sector. Exports and Export Proceeds Five public enterprises under the Ministry of External Trade have a monopoly on the exports of coffee, cotton, meat, sugar, and certain nontraditional exports; export of these items require a general authorization from the Central Bank. Other exports require specific authoriza- tion from the Central Bank, which is issued after verification that the export prices are consistent with those prevailing in international markets. With a few exceptions, foreign exchange proceeds from exports must be surrendered to an authorized bank within 30 to 60 days of shipment. Failure to surrender foreign exchange from export proceeds will result in revocation of the export license. All export proceeds are subject to obligatory surrender at the official exchange rate. Under the special foreign exchange incentive scheme provided by the Central Bank for producers of cattle and coffee, producers selling their product to the state marketing company are entitled to purchase from the Central Bank a certain amount of U .S. dollars at the official rate, which varies from US$2 to US$11, depend- ing on the quantity and quality of the product; the producers are free to sell such dollars at the free market rate. A few agricultural export products are subject to ad valorem taxes, which are applied progressively with the international prices for those exports. Proceeds from Invisibles All invisible receipts other than those from tourism and private remittances must either be surrendered to, or deposited w i th, the banking system. Receipts from most invisibles are exchanged at the official rate and receipts ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution from certain invisibles can be exchanged at C$50 per U .S. dollar. Receipts from tourism and private remit- tances can be sold at the free market rate. Arriving adult tourists are required to exchange forthwith US$50 at the official rate. Charges for hotel rooms, including interna- tional telephone calls, must be settled in U.S. dollars. Capital All capital transactions require authorization from the Central Bank. Foreign exchange receipts from loans and investments made under the Foreign Investment Law must be surrendered to the Central Bank through its authorized agents at the official exchange rate. Foreign exchange for servicing of external debt disbursed before February 8, 1985 is sold at a special rate of C$10 per US$1; for the servicing of external debt contracted on or after February 8, 1985, the official rate is applied when foreign exchange is available. Depending on the avail- ability of foreign exchange, Central Bank authorization is given for servicing private external debt. There are arrears on principal obligations on public external debt. Gold The Nicaraguan Mining Institute manages the coun- try's gold production. The Central Bank is in charge of selling gold at prices prevailing in international gold markets. The Central Bank can sell gold to domestic, industrial, and other users. Commemorative gold coins were issued in 1967, 1975, and 1980. Natural and juridical persons may trade gold coins for numismatic purposes only. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement February 8. The exchange arrangement was modified as follows: (1) The official exchange rate was adjusted from C$10 = US$1 to C$28 = US$1, representing a devaluation of 64.3 percent. The new rate would be applied to all export proceeds, receipts from freight, insurance, port services, investment income, expendi- tures by foreign embassies, payments for imports of specified imports of nonessential consumer goods, pay- ments for other transport services, expenditures by Nicaraguan embassies and commercial offices abroad, commission payments, payments for settlements of insurance, and other expenses related to the opening of letters of credit and similar modes of payments. (2) The application of mixed exchange rates for the conversion of specified export proceeds was discontinued. (3) The exchange rate of C$10 = US$1 would continue to be applied to interest and amortization payments on external loans disbursed as of February 8, 1985; debt service payments on external loans disbursed thereafter would be settled at the exchange rate applicable to imports of goods and services financed by the respective foreign loans. (4) A special exchange rate of C$20 = US$1 would be applied for imports of raw materials, spare parts, and specified essential goods. (5) A separate exchange rate of C$40 = US$1 would be applied to NICARAGUA imports of capital goods, as compared to the previous rate of C$15 = US$1 for capital goods in general and C$28 = US$1 for private motor vehicles. (6) Another exchange rate of C$50 = US$1 was introduced for exports of printed materials, international communica- tions and foreign grants, payments for business and official travel, medical treatment, and student expendi- tures abroad, foreign subscriptions, expenses for interna- tional communications, professional fees for foreign experts, and transactions through foreign credit cards. (7) Steps were taken to establish a legal "free" exchange market where the rate would be administered on the basis of supply and demand, and eligible transactions would consist of receipts from tourism, private inward remit- tances, and other invisibles not subject to conversion at the fixed exchange rate; on the payment side, the free market rate would apply to imports of goods and services other than those specified as eligible for settlement at one of the fixed exchange rates. May 20. The free exchange market (as announced on February 8, 1985) began operations, and an exchange house was authorized by the Central Bank to handle all transactions in this market. July 13. A regulation was introduced requiring trans- actions in respect of nontrade insurance and reinsurance other than for aircraft to be settled at the official exchange rate of C$28 = US$1; insurance and reinsur- ance for aircraft should be effected at the rate of C$40 = US$1. December 12. Fifty percent of the foreign exchange commissions of travel agencies operating in Nicaragua were made subject to conversion at the official exchange rate; the remaining 50 percent were required to be settled in the free market. Imports and Import Payments February 8. Payments for specified nonessential con- sumer goods were made eligible for settlement at the exchange rate of C$28 = US$1. In addition, a special exchange rate of C$20 = US$1 was introduced for imports of raw materials, spare parts, and certain essential goods, and another exchange rate of C$40 = US$1 was announced for imports of a wide range of capital goods. May 20. It was announced that foreign exchange for payment of imports not eligible in the official exchange market could be purchased at the free exchange market. Payments for Invisibles February 8. The new official exchange rate of C$28 = US$1 began to be applied to payments for transport services, expenditures by Nicaraguan embas- sies and commercial offices abroad, commission pay- ments, and payments for insurance and expenses related to the opening of letters of credit and similar modes of payments. May 20. It was announced that foreign exchange for invisible payments not eligible for settlement through the 385 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NICARAGUA official exchange market could be purchased at the free exchange market. July 13. It was announced that foreign exchange transactions for nontrade insurance and reinsurance should be effected at the official exchange rate of C$28 = US$1, with the exception of transactions for insurance and reinsurance of aircraft, which would be effected at the rate of C$40 = US$1. Exports and Export Proceeds. February 8. The application of mixed exchange rates to proceeds from specified export products was discon- tinued, and the official exchange rate of C$28 = US$1 became applicable to proceeds of all exports other than printed material for which an exchange rate of C$50 = US$1 was introduced. May 20. As an incentive for the production of cattle, the Central Bank announced that producers selling their cattle to the State Marketing Company would be entitled to purchase U .S. dollars from the Central Bank at the official rate, up to an amount varying from US$2 to US$11 per head of cattle, depending on the quan t i ty and quality of the cattle; such dollars could be sold at the free market rate. November 14. As a special foreign exchange incentive for the production of coffee during the 1985/86 season, the Central Bank announced that producers selling their coffee to Empresa Nicaraguense del Cafe (ENCAFFE) would be allowed to purchase U .S. dollars at the off ic ial rate from the Central Bank, in an amount of US$5 for a quintal of coffee beans. Private producers could use such dollars for any purpose or sell them at the free market rate, and public producers could either use them to pay for essential imports or sell them at the free market rate in order to pay existing bank debt in local currency.

Not for Redistribution NIGER (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Niger is the CFA Franc ,1 which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. The official buy ing and selling rates are CFAF 50 = F 1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market and the fixed rate between the French franc and the CFA franc. The BCEAO levies a commission of 0.01 percent on transfers from countries outside the West African Mone- tary Union (WAMU) and one of 0.025 percent on transfers to such countries. Transfers by the Treasury and the Postal Administration and transactions in bank notes and traveler's checks are exempted. Banks levy a fixed commission of CFAF 100 plus a proportional levy of 0.25 percent for transfers inside the Un ion. For transfers outside the French franc zone there is a further exchange commission at a market determined rate. Seventy-two percent of the revenue from commissions charged by the banks on transfers outside the Union must in turn be transferred to the Treasury. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of measures relating to gold and the repatriation of export proceeds, Niger's exchange controls do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Cote d'lvoire, Equato- rial Guinea, Gabon, Mali, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the External Finance Directorate in the Ministry of Finance. The BCEAO is authorized to collect, either directly or through the banks, financial ins t i tu t ions, the Postal Administration, and notaries public, any information necessary to compile balance of payments statistics. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through the BCEAO, the Postal Administra- tion, or authorized banks. Import and export licenses are issued by the Directorate of External Trade in the Ministry of Commerce and Transportation, subject to endorsement by the External Finance Directorate, except for licenses relating to gold, which are granted by the Ministry of Finance. Import certificates for liberalized commodities are made out by the importer himself and are approved by the External Finance Directorate. The CFA franc is issued by the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de 1'Ouest (BCEAO) and is the common currency in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d' lvo ire, Ma l i, Niger, Senegal, and Togo. Prescription of Currency Since Niger has an Operations Account with the French Treasury, settlements w i th France (as defined above), Monaco, and the countries linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any franc area country. Current payments to or from The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are normally made through the West African Clearing House. Certain settlements with Nigeria are still effected through special accounts.2 Settlements with all other countries are usually effected through correspondent banks in France, in foreign cur- rencies, or in French francs, through Foreign Accounts in Francs. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. Foreign Accounts in Francs may be credited w i th BCEAO bank notes mailed to the BCEAO agency in N iamey by an authorized bank's foreign correspondent. Otherwise, the crediting to nonresident accounts of BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, or bank notes issued by any other institute of issue that ma in ta ins an Operations Account w i th the French Treasury is prohibited. Foreign Accounts in Francs may be debited, without prior authorization, with the value of BCEAO bank notes mailed by authorized intermediaries to their foreign correspondents. Imports and Import Payments All imports originating in South Africa are prohibited. Imports of soap, cement, and certain printed cotton fabrics are prohibited, irrespective of origin, unless a special authorization is issued by the Ministry of Com- merce and Transportation. The import from any source of rice, paddy, hulled rice, wheat flour, butane gas, several types of fabric, certain footwear, and certain plastic goods requires prior authorization, irrespective of whether an import license or import certificate is also required. A similar regime applies to imports of sugar, except from member countries of the Common African and Mauritian Organization, and to imports of matches, unless they originate in a member country of the West African Economic Community (WAEC). Imports from France and from countries linked w i th the French Treasury by an Operations Account of all goods other than those mentioned above (or those listed in Article 1 of Order No. 042/MC/DCE of October 18, 1982) may be made freely w i thout a license or certificate. Imports from 2The bilateral payments agreement w i th Nigeria lapsed at the end of 1977. However, Niger continues to ma in ta in accounts w i th banks in Nigeria credited w i th receipts of exports to Nigeria by certain public enterprises in Nigeria; the funds are used to finance imports of oil from Nigeria by enterprises in N iger. 387 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NIGER other countries require either a license or an import certificate. Imports of virtually all goods from Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and the six original member states of the EC, many goods from other OECD countries and their past or present dependent territories, and a smaller number of items from the United States and Canada are liberalized and require only an import certificate. Im- ports of nonliberalized goods from non-EC countries outside the French Franc Area are made under global quotas in accordance with an annual program determined each year by the Ministry of Commerce and Transporta- tion. Licenses for certain cotton fabrics are conditional upon purchases of the corresponding domestic product. Goods not subject to quantitative restriction may be imported on an import certificate. Beginning from October 1, 1985, the Societe Nationale de Commerce et de Production du Niger (COPRONIGER) no longer maintains a monopoly on the import of specified commodities, including salt, ciga- rettes, green tea, and certain textiles. All import transac- tions with foreign countries must be domiciled w i th an authorized bank when valued at more than CFAF 25,000 c . i . f. at the border. Import licenses or import certificates entitle importers to purchase the necessary exchange, provided that the authorized bank is satisfied that the import transaction is genuine and in accordance w i th the import title. Import certificates require the visa of the External Finance Directorate if the goods have to be paid for before they are imported. Foreign exchange may not be purchased before the payment due date if the goods have already been imported, or un t il eight days prior to the shipment date if the goods are covered by documen- tary credit. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and countries linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to the approval of the External Finance Directorate, which for certain transactions has delegated its powers to the authorized banks. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted freely when the basic transaction has been approved. Residents traveling as tourists to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and countries linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account may obtain an exchange allocation equivalent to CFAF 100,000 a person a trip (CFAF 50,000 for children under 10 years), which may be taken up twice a year; any foreign exchange in excess of CFAF 5,000 remaining after return to Niger must be surrendered w i th in eight days to an authorized bank. The transfer of savings from their salaries by foreigners working in Niger is subject to prior approval by the External Finance Directorate and is normally limited to 50 percent of net pay. Larger 388 transfers are permitted, however, against presentation of supporting documents. Residents traveling to foreign countries may take out up to a max imum of CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, and bank notes of other countries linked w i th the French Treasury by an Opera- tions Accoun t, in addition to their travel allocation. Residents traveling to other countries of the French Franc Area may take out any amount in BCEAO bank notes bu t, when trave l ing to a coun try of the French Franc Area outside the West African Monetary Un ion, must declare these if they exceed CFAF 150,000. Nonresident travelers may freely take out up to CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, and bank notes of other countries linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account, and foreign notes up to the amount declared upon en t ry ,3 or, if no declaration was made, up to CFAF 25,000; they may also take out freely any amount of foreign currency traveler's checks, etc ., issued abroad in their name. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. All exports of rice and paddy require the prior authorization of the Ministry of Commerce and Transportation. Exports of millet and sorghum are prohibited unless covered by a shipping document in the name of the Office des Produits Vivriers du N iger (OPVN ). Gum arabic may be exported only by COPRONIGER. With the exception of peanuts, peanut oil, peanut cakes, sisal, cotton, cottonseed, and certain other imported items, all of wh ich require a license, all other exports to France (as defined above) and the Operations Account countries may be made freely. Exports of domestic products and imported commodities to other countries require a license and an exchange commitment. In principle, the due date of payment for exports to foreign countries must not be later than 180 days after arrival of the goods at their destination. Proceeds from exports, regardless of the buy ing coun try, must be collected and surrendered through an authorized intermediary bank w i th in one month of the due date. All exports, regardless of des t ina t ion, must be domiciled w i th an authorized bank when their va lue exceeds CFAF 500,000. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles w i th France (as defined above), Monaco, and the other countries linked w i th the French Treasury by an Operations Account may be retained. All amounts due from resi- dents of other countries in respect of services and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be collected and surrendered w i th in two months of 3This amount is reduced, when appropriate, by the amount sold for CFA francs and increased by the amount of foreign notes acquired in Niger by debit to a Foreign Account in Francs or a foreign currency account, by exchange for other foreign means of payment b rought in, or by repurchase w i th CFA francs (such repurchase be ing l im i ted to the equ iva lent of CFAF 25,000). ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution the due date or the date of receipt. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BCEAO, the Bank of France, or a bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin). Residents must surrender within eight days of entry any foreign currency in excess of CFAF 5,000. Capital Capital movements between Niger and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the other countries linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require approval by the exchange control authority and are restricted, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. Special controls (additional to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable) are maintained over borrowing abroad, over inward and outward invest- ment, and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Niger. Such operations require prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. Exempt from authorization, however, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Nigerien Government, and (2) shares that are identical with, or may be substituted for, securities whose issuance or sale in Niger has previously been authorized. With the exception of controls over foreign securities, these measures do not apply to relations with France (as defined above), Monaco, member countries of the West African Monetary Union, and other countries linked w i th the French Treasury by an Operations Account. Special controls are maintained also over the soliciting of funds for deposit with foreign private persons and foreign firms and institutions, and over publicity aimed at placing funds abroad or at subscribing to real estate development operations abroad; these special controls also apply to France (as defined above), Monaco, and countries linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account. All the special provisions described in this paragraph apply only to transactions and not to the associated payments or collections. All investments abroad by residents of Niger require prior authorization by the Minister of Finance;4 75 percent of the value must be financed from borrowing abroad. Foreign direct investments in Niger5 must be declared to the Minister of Finance before they are made. The Minister has a period of two months from receipt of the declaration, during which he may request postpone- ment of the project. The fu ll or partial liquidation of either type of investment also requires prior declaration to the Minister. Both the making and the liquidation of investments, whether these are Nigerien investments abroad or foreign investments in Niger, must be reported Including those made through foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in Niger and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Niger. 5 Including those made by companies in Niger that are directly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in Niger of foreign companies. NIGER to the Minister of Finance and the BCEAO within 20 days following each operation. Direct investments constitute investments imp ly ing control of a company or an enterprise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. Lending abroad is subject to prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. Borrowing by residents from nonresidents requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans constituting a direct investment, which are subject to prior declaration, as indicated above; (2) loans contracted by authorized banks; and (3) loans other than those mentioned above, when the total amount outstand- ing of these loans, including the new borrowing, does not exceed CFAF 2 million for any one borrower, provided that the annual interest rate does not exceed the normal market rate and that the proceeds of the loan are immediately sold on the exchange market or debited to a Foreign Account in Francs. The repayment of a foreign borrowing constituting a direct investment is subject to the same formalities as the liquidation of a direct investment; the repayment of other borrowings requires authorization only to the extent that the borrowing itself was subject to prior authorization. Foreign investments in Niger may be granted certain guarantees and facilities under the Investment Code of July 31, 1968 and its amending texts. Existing benefits accorded under the previous Investment Code have been maintained. The new Investment Code provides for privileged or regular treatment. The latter provides assurances, for both new and existing enterprises, with respect to indemnities in the event of expropriation and concerning nondiscrimination between Nigerien nation- als and foreign nationals; tax exemptions may be granted for new investments. Privileged treatment is reserved for enterprises deemed to be of special importance to national economic development and falling within specified categories of industrial activities. Such treat- ment may be accorded under two different regimes, the approval regime and the agreement regime. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Niger. Imports and exports of gold from or to any other country require prior authorization by the Minister of Finance, which is seldom granted. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the Treasury or the BCEAO; (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles contain- ing a minor quan t i ty of gold (such as gold-filled or gold- plated articles); and (3) articles of gold up to a combined weight of 500 grams when carried by a traveler. Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Changes During 1985 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 389 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NIGERIA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Nigeria is the Nigerian Naira. Nigeria does not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions and pursues an independent and flexible exchange rate policy. The official middle rate for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is determined on the basis of a basket of currencies. Official buying and selling rates are set at 0.25 percent on either side of the middle rate. On December 31, 1985 the middle rate against the U.S. dollar was US$1.0004 per N 1, and the buying and selling rates were US$1.0029 and US$0.9979, respectively, per N 1. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) also quotes daily rates at which it is prepared to deal in pounds sterling. Cross rates are also available for other currencies.l All exchange dealings are for approved transactions and are on a spot basis only.2 There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. However, nongovernmental transactions are subject to a commission of 0.25 percent. For approved transactions, authorized dealers may deal at market rates, spot or forward, between them- selves and with resident and nonresident customers. Authorized dealers may enter freely into contracts with residents of Nigeria for the purchase or sale of any foreign currency for delivery at a future date, provided that the transaction is one that would be acceptable on a spot basis and relates to a firm commercial contract for the import or export of goods or to freight charges on a specific shipment of goods and is payable in a foreign currency. Forward contracts related to imports must not extend more than six months beyond the expiration date of the import license or beyond the date of import, when the license has no expiration date or when no license is required. Forward contracts related to exports may cover any necessary period, provided that payment for the goods is to be received within three months of shipment or within such longer period as may have been authorized. Administration of Control The Federal Ministry of Finance is responsible for basic exchange control policy and, in principle, for approving applications for the following: copyrights; the repatriation of capital and transfer of profits; the raising of external loans, including repayment of such loans; borrowing in Nigeria by companies controlled directly or indirectly from outside Nigeria (other than local bank overdrafts to pay for imports); the granting of "approved status" to nonresident investments in Nigeria; and any 'For example, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, French francs, deutsche mark, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, and Swiss francs. 2The Central Bank buys and sells U .S. dollars and pounds sterling and is prepared to buy only those other currencies for which it quotes daily rates. 390 dealings in foreign securities. The Central Bank is the principal administrator of exchange control. Most com- mercial banks and merchant banks have been appointed as authorized dealers by the Ministry of Finance and are empowered to deal in foreign currencies and to approve applications in accordance with instructions issued by the Central Bank. Any application that does not fall within the scope of the authority of these authorized dealers must be submitted to the Central Bank or, for the transactions mentioned above, to the Ministry of Fi- nance. Certain hotels and rest houses have also been appointed authorized buyers of foreign currency and traveler's checks. All export proceeds and other proceeds in foreign currencies are centralized with the Central Bank. The Central Bank supplies the authorized banks with foreign exchange for approved payments. The administration of trade controls, including is- suance of import licenses, is carried out by the Federal Ministry of Trade and the Import Licensing Committee, comprising officials of the Ministries of Trade, Finance, and Economic Development, as well as representatives of the Central Bank and the Department of Customs and Excise. Prescription of Currency Authorized payments may be made in naira to an External Account in Nigeria or in any foreign currency. The proceeds of exports to foreign countries may be received in naira from an External Account, in any foreign currency that is freely exchangeable for naira, or in any specified currency. Settlements with the central banks of West African states (for Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'lvoire, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea- Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo) are normally made through the West African Clearing House. Nonresident Accounts There are three categories of nonresident accounts: External Accounts, Nonresident Accounts, and Blocked Accounts. External Accounts are maintained for diplo- matic representatives of all countries and international organizations. They may be credited with authorized payments by residents of Nigeria to residents of foreign countries, with payments from other External Accounts, and with proceeds from sales of foreign currencies. They may be debited for payments to residents of Nigeria, with payments to other External Accounts, and for purchases of foreign currencies. Funds derived from local sources may be deposited in Nonresident Accounts. Such accounts may be credited with proceeds from services rendered locally, provided that the operation of such accounts has been reported to and approval has been obtained from the Central Bank before any foreign ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution transfers are effected. Blocked Accounts are accounts to which are credited funds that are blocked by directives given under Section 27 of the Exchange Control Act. Imports and Import Payments3 Nigeria's import policies are formulated w i th the basic objectives of promoting industrialization (protection of local industries), diversifying the economy, and support- ing the balance of payments. All nonprohibited imports are subject to a specific import licensing requ iremen t .4 Licenses are issued by the Ministry of Trade wh ich stamps them either "valid for foreign exchange" or "not valid for foreign exchange." In the latter case, imports are effected against the drawdown of loan contracts, the use of inter-company credit facilities, or the use of the importer's resources held abroad. In the former instance, licenses are issued in the context of an overall foreign exchange budget and value limits accorded to govern- ment, industrial goods, food, and general merchandise, with the latter subdivided into subsectoral groupings. Criteria applied in evaluating import licenses for manu- facturing industries include: (i) the extent to wh ich the manufacturing industry concerned uses local raw mate- rials; (ii) the foreign exchange earnings generated by the company's products; (iii) the linkage effect of the products of the company to those of other industries; (iv) the amount of capital invested in the company, together with its turnover; and (v) geographical location. An import license guarantees the availability of foreign exchange up to the value stated in the license. Licenses generally remain valid un t il the end of the calendar year in which they are issued. Some licenses, generally for high-value, bu lky products, are granted for up to half of the value requested and w i th a validity period that does not extend beyond the middle of the calendar year; however, provided the recipient of such license makes fu ll use of it, an extension is automatically granted in an amount equivalent to that originally g iven, and for a period not to run beyond the calendar year. An import prohibition may be applied if, among other considera- tions, the authorities arrive at a judgment that domestic requirements can be fu l ly met by domestic production, or if the items concerned are considered nonessential. Items which may not be imported are subdivided into two categories: those the importation of which is absolutely prohibited, and those wh ich may be imported only as personal effects. The former category contains 22 items, among which are maize, rice, air pistols, counterfeit coins of any coun try, secondhand c lo th ing, certain types of spirits, meat declared to be un f it for consumption, and indecent or obscene prints. The latter category comprises 68 items, inc lud ing cigarettes, live poultry (except day-old chicks), vegetables, pastries, fresh f ru i t, potatoes, textile fabrics, beer, fresh m i lk, rice in packets or in containers of less than 50 kilograms, 3As part of the budget program for 1986, it was announced that a flat 30 percent levy would be imposed on all imports in addition to all current duties. 4A11 imports from South Afr ica and Nam ib ia are proh ib i ted. NIGERIA toothpaste, and passenger cars w i th a c . i . f. va lue each exceeding N 15,000 or an engine capacity exceeding 2,500 cubic centimeters. An M form must be completed for all imports into N iger ia, irrespective of va lue. Au thor ized dealers regis- ter M forms re la t ing to the imports of the private sector and the parastatals; the Federal M in i s t ry of Finance registers M forms re la t ing to imports of the federal and state governments. Prior to registering an M form, an importer must have obtained an import license for the goods to be imported; and he must be able to present a tax clearance certificate (showing the settlement of all tax l iab i l i t ies) covering the previous three years. In registering M forms, authorized dealers are required to ensure that (a) they endorse the associated import license w i th the total va lue of M forms registered against the license, (b) the total value of each import license is not exceeded by the value of M forms registered against it, and (c) all import licenses are u t i l ized for the specific items for wh ich they have been issued. It is only after an M form has been processed and registered that an importer can confirm his order to the seller. In the absence of a registered M form, a letter of credit may not be opened, nor may any form of payment for imports be effected. On completion of processing, M forms gener- ally remain valid for six mon ths, dur ing wh ich period the items specified must arrive in N iger ia; revalidation beyond the expiry period is granted subject to the va l id i ty of the import license. The Exchange Control Department in the Central Bank checks all M forms. Each registered M form submitted to the Central Bank must be accompanied by a pro forma invoice for the imports, showing the price split into f .o .b. and fre igh t, w i th all ancillary charges, such as commissions and interest charges, shown separately; in addition, each submitted M form must be supported by a statement showing the M forms already registered in favor of the importer dur ing the past 12 mon ths, together w i th details of the u t i l iza t ion of such forms, inc lud ing quan t i t ies, va lues, and the dates of arrival and collection of goods involved. Approval for the release of foreign exchange against an accepted M form rests w i th the Central Bank. All imports valued at N 1,000 or more are subject to preshipment inspec t ion ,5 to ensure that all imports into Nigeria are of the correct qua l i ty and quan t i ty according to the contracts, and that only the normal price of that commodity in the country of supply is paid. Unless a "Clean Report of Findings" on the goods to be imported has been issued, foreign exchange settlement for imports 5The o f f i c i a l ly designated compan ies for the inspection are: Cotecna, Dan iel C.

Not for Redistribution NIGERIA may not be effected. With regard to price, the final invoice for the imports does not have to agree with the details declared on the M form, provided that (a) the price is supported in every respect by a Clean Report of Findings issued by a designated preshipment agent, and (b) any increase over the declared M form price does not exceed 10 percent of the declared total c . i . f. amount. An increase in price in excess of 10 percent requires a new M form. However, for goods exempted from preship- ment inspection because of their value, approval for payment will not be granted for more than the value of the original application. When import payments are to be made against confirmed letters of credit, all shipping documents relating to the imported goods must be lodged with the Exchange Control Department at the Central Bank within 21 days of receipt of the claim cable by the Central Bank. Bills of entry, against cable claims, must be submitted to the Central Bank within 90 days of the Bank's receipt of the cable. All other means of payment require submission to the Central Bank of the fu ll set of documents, evidencing the receipt of the goods in Nigeria. Under normal circumstances, the completed "package" of documents is processed within two to seven days. If the Central Bank is satisfied with all the documents, the Exchange Control Department will issue a foreign exchange release order (an accepted M form) to the Foreign Operations Department of the Central Bank. However, an ad hoc reinspection of the documents can be undertaken in consultation with the Foreign Opera- tions Department before a foreign exchange release order is issued. With the exception of some payments made by the Central Bank for the Government, foreign exchange is released to authorized dealers, allowing them to effect payment for imports or to reimburse their correspondent banks for import payments already made. Other than against letters of credit, payment for imports may also be made against bills for collection, intercompany open accounts, usance bills, or most other credit terms arranged between importers and exporters. Import con- tracts requiring deferred payments or installments need approval from the Central Bank for private sector imports and from the Ministry of Finance for public sector imports. Prepayment for imports by the parastatals and the private sector is prohibited. Certain import payments have been delayed. Subject to the availability of funds, the Central Bank releases foreign exchange against accepted M forms or A forms on a "first in, first out" basis, and according to the following priority categories: (a) payments for the servicing of the external debt, medical bills, business travel allowances, seminars, personal home remittances, school fees, and certain obligations of the Nigerian Airlines and Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation; (b) payments for importation against letter of credit of raw materials, books, spare parts, medicine, and other essential goods; and (c) all other payments. Settlement of the interest charges is usually effected when the arrears are settled. Settlement of arrears is made at the exchange rate prevailing on the settlement date. Arrears on 392 payments due to commercial banks (on letters of credit) and uninsured imports have been subject to consolidation agreements. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to residents of other countries are subject to individual approval; for some categories of invisibles this is granted by authorized dealers, either up to specified limits or up to the amount of the bill or invoice. Locally disbursed profits and dividend pay- ments that can be remitted abroad may not exceed 30 percent of a company's capital stock. New profits and dividends may be remitted as soon as they are declared, provided that, in the case of airline and shipping com- panies, a tax at the rate of 10 percent is paid. The tax is held on account until corporate tax returns are assessed and filed. Remittances of technical fees, management fees, and royalties are permitted when it can be shown that these are related to the import of modern technol- ogy. Payments for technical services and management fees require approval by the Ministry of Finance and the submission of a detailed report describing the state of implementation of the provisions of the respective agreements. A max imum of 2 percent of profit before tax is permitted. For new companies a lump sum is applied in lieu of the 2 percent of profit before tax for the first three years. Similar policies are applicable to other payments for services, such as those relating to copy- rights and trademarks. In the case of royalties, exchange allowance is based on volume of sales, subject to a maximum of 1 percent, except for books and musical records, which are treated on a case-by-case basis in relation to international practice. Foreign consultants performing professional services in Nigeria are allowed to remit to their associates abroad up to 20 percent of the amount contracted, excluding the cost of prefeasibility and feasibility studies. Applications for payments that cannot be approved by authorized dealers and are not among those (such as profits and dividends) that require approval by the Ministry of Finance are forwarded to the Central Bank for decision. An A form, which is subject to a similar review process as an M form, must be filed with the Central Bank for all invisible payments. All insurance other than that for which facilities do not exist in Nigeria must be taken out with a company in Nigeria. Residents are entitled to a basic travel allowance in foreign exchange up to a limit equivalent to N 100 a person a year (there is no allowance for children under 16 years). There is also a separate allowance for pilgrims; each pilgrim 16 years and older is entitled to a maximum of N 800. The basic travel allowance and that for the pilgrims are mutually exclusive; that is, no individual may obtain the two in one fiscal year. Foreign exchange for these purposes may be sold to residents by authorized dealers. In addition, travel agents and ship- ping and airline companies in Nigeria may sell transpor- tation tickets for any destination against payment in Nigerian currency. The cost of services rendered by ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution travel agents in respect of hotel accommodation, meals en route, etc. must be covered from the basic travel allowance. Foreign exchange is no longer made avail- able for medical treatment abroad, unless the need for such treatment is certified by the Chief Medical Officer of the state where the applicant is resident (on the recommendation of the State Medical Board), and subject to a letter from an overseas doctor or hospital indicating acceptance for such treatment and stating bills payable and the number of days of stay for medical treatment abroad. No official sales of foreign exchange are made to new students intending to follow under- graduate or professional courses abroad; such sales are allowed only for postgraduate courses abroad, provided that the courses are not available at Nigerian universities and are considered relevant to the needs of the national economy. Students who on January 1, 1984 were attending universities or institutions of higher learning abroad and had previously been granted foreign ex- change are, however, exempted from the new regula- tions, provided that their applications for foreign ex- change are accompanied by adequate documentation, including a letter from a Nigerian Embassy or High Commission abroad; if appropriate documentation is presented, exceptions to this regulation may be made for students who have not previously received remittances of foreign exchange. Foreign exchange allowances for elementary school education abroad are not granted except in special cases, such as those of handicapped children for whom educational facilities are not available locally. Exchange applications for most nontourist travel must be submitted to the Central Bank. Remittances by residents for g ift purposes are limited to N 150 a year for individuals and N 500 for charitable organizations. Foreign nationals residing in Nigeria may purchase annua l ly foreign currency up to 25 percent of their net income for all personal remittances (including insurance, education, medical expenses, proceeds from sales of assets, provident fund contributions, sundry payments, and the basic travel allowance); applications in excess of this limit are examined on their merits by the Central Bank. When taking overseas leave, foreign nationals may also convert up to two months' pay into foreign exchange. Residents are permitted to take out the equivalent of their basic travel allowance in foreign currency notes and traveler's checks; nonresident visitors may take out any foreign currency notes and traveler's checks that were declared upon entry, m inus the amount converted locally into Nigerian currency. Travelers may take out N 20 in domestic notes and coin; all other export of Nigerian currency notes and coin is prohibited.

NIGERIA import policies. Consequently, certain exports are pro- hibited, while others are subject to licensing require- men ts .7 The exportation of 11 items is absolutely prohibited; these include beans, maize, rice, m i lk, groundnut oil, and all imported food products. In addition, the export of African antiques, works of art, and objects used (or which have been used) in African ceremonies is prohibited, except under prescribed condi- tions. A further list of 36 products may be exported only under license. These latter products include cigarettes and tobacco, unrefined gold, petroleum products, raw cocoa beans, raw cotton, groundnuts, cottonseed cake, oil and meal and palm kernel cake, meal, and oil. The sale abroad of all export crops purchased by the Commodity Boards (cocoa, cotton, groundnuts, and palm kernels) is the responsibility of each Board under the general guidance of the Export Commodity Coor- dinating Council. Exports of petroleum are handled by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and are subject to special arrangements. Export proceeds must be surrendered, through an authorized dealer, to the Central Bank w i th in three months of shipment. For all exports, the exporter is required to submit an exchange control declaration at the time of shipment. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in foreign currencies must be sold to an authorized dealer, for surrender to the Central Bank. Persons entering Nigeria may freely bring in foreign bank notes, but must cash such foreign currency with an authorized dealer who mus t, in turn, surrender it to the Central Bank. Travelers may bring in N 20 in domestic currency; all other import of Nigerian currency notes and coins is prohibited. Capital* Except for the purpose of financing imports or exports, permission is required from the Ministry of Finance for any ind iv idua l, firm, company, or branch resident in Nigeria to borrow abroad. In addition, official agencies and state-controlled corporations require the prior approval of the Ministry of Finance for any foreign borrowing. The contracting of suppliers' credit abroad by state-controlled corporations or agencies also is subject to approval by the Ministry of Finance. The permission of the Ministry of Finance is required for borrowing in Nigeria (1) by any nonresident individual or company, and (2) by any company registered in Nigeria (other than a bank) which is controlled directly or indirectly from outside Nigeria. However, to enable entities mentioned under (2) to meet temporary shortages of funds, licensed banks in Nigeria may grant loans or overdrafts for periods not exceeding 14 days, or may increase the amount of any advance or overdraft by the amount of loan interest or bank charges payable thereon. 7Exports to South Afr ica and Nam ib ia are p roh ib i ted. 8 As part of the budget for 1986, the Nigerian authorities announced in January 1986 that external debt service paymen ts dur ing the year wou ld be limited to 30 percent of budgeted foreign exchange earnings. 393 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NIGERIA General permission is also given for any loan, bank overdraft, or other credit facility to be arranged to finance Nigerian imports or exports of goods. Residents of Nigeria may not deal in foreign currency securities or buy from or sell to nonresidents of Nigeria any security payable in naira without the permission of the Ministry of Finance. The capital proceeds of securi- ties registered in Nigeria and owned by nonresidents may be collected and negotiated through authorized dealers, provided that the prior permission of the Ministry of Finance is obtained. Exchange for the transfer of certain assets by emi- grants or repatriates is granted on final departure from the country, but the transfer of the proceeds of assets realized in order to comply with the Nigerian Enterprises Promotion Decrees of 1972 and 1977 may take place upon receipt. Ceilings for foreign capital participation in the equity capital of enterprises in various sectors of the economy have been set by the Indigenization Decree of 1974, as amended in June 1976 and January 1977. Nonresidents intending to make direct investments in Nigeria may apply to the Ministry of Finance for approved status, the granting of which means that sympathetic consideration will be given to fu ture requests to repatriate the capital and related profits and dividends. Beginning from January 1, 1985 dividends due to nonresident investors can be invested in new local companies, provided that an additional amount equal to half of the remittable amount is imported; the additional capital inflow is required to enable the investor to qualify for "approved status." The granting of approved status is not applicable to the purchase of shares on the stock exchange in Nigeria unless this forms an integral part of the approved investment project. Furthermore, this status is not normally granted when internally generated funds from profits, dividends, rents, or bank credit or locally raised loans are invested in local enterprises. With minor exceptions, foreign-owned companies and commercial banks operating in Nigeria must be incorporated in Nigeria. The repatriation of foreign capital requires approval from the Ministry of Finance. Gold With the permission of the Federal Ministry of Finance, residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Nigeria for numismatic purposes. Residents other than the monetary authorities, producers of gold, and autho- rized industrial users are not allowed, without special permission, to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry or coin, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require specific licenses issued by the Ministry of Finance; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, producers of gold, and industrial users. Furthermore, the import of U .K. gold coin requires a license from the Commissioner of Customs and Excise, and the import of 394 other gold coin requires a specific import license. Imports of gold coin and gold and silver bullion are free of duty when made by the Central Bank; otherwise, such imports are subject to customs duty at 100 percent ad valorem. Changes During 1985 Nonresident Accounts October 1. Authorization was granted for persons resident in Nigeria, diplomats, foreign diplomatic mis- sions, and international organizations to operate foreign currency accounts in Nigeria. Sixteen banks were em- powered to open such accounts, which should be denominated in U .S. dollars, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, deutsche mark, or French francs. Operations of the account were declared to be free of exchange control formalities; interest would be paid in foreign exchange at rates comparable to the ruling interestrates for the currency of the deposit and would be tax-exempt. Foreign exchange from all but the following sources would be eligible for deposit in such accounts: (a) the sale of crude oil or petroleum products; (b) exports of goods and services, excluding any portion approved for the exporter to retain; (c) agency commissions; (d) oil bunkering operations; and (e) external loans and foreign currencies bought by authorized dealers. Account own- ers could use their deposits for any purpose, including import transactions, but were prohibited from selling funds in their accounts for use outside the banking system. Withdrawals from such accounts would be noted in the account holders' passport, as is done for all other legitimate transactions in foreign currency. Imports and Import Payments January I. As part of the abolition of the system of foreign exchange allocations to authorized dealers (which included the abolition of the allocation co- efficients), M forms ceased to serve as an application for foreign exchange; instead, an import license would guarantee the availability of foreign exchange up to the value stated in the license. Authorized dealers would continue to register, and give initial approval to, M forms for imports by the private sector and parastatals; in this connection, the dealers were required to ensure that: (a) specific import licenses were endorsed with the total value of M forms registered by them against the import license; (b) the total value of each specific import license was not exceeded by the value of M forms registered against the license; and (c) that specific import licenses were utilized for the items for which they had been issued.

NIGERIA 395 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NORWAY (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Norway is the Norwegian Krone. The external value of the krone is pegged to a currency index number reflecting the average change in the exchange rates of the 14 currencies most important to Norway's external trade and payments. The exchange rate is managed so as to allow only limited fluctuations (± 2.25 percent) around the benchmark for the effective value. The weights of the index are, in principle, based on Norway's exports of processed goods to each of the countries whose currencies are included, taking also into account competitive relations with third countries. The exchange rate of the krone for the U.S. dollar, the principal intervention currency, is quoted daily, together with those of 18 other currencies, on the basis of the market rates. On December 31, 1985 the buy ing and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were NKr 7.5715 and NKr 7.5935, respectively, per US$1. Forward premiums and discounts are left to the interplay of market forces. Forward transactions with nonbank residents by autho- rized banks and foreign exchange brokers must have a commercial basis. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Norway formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from May 11, 1967. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Ministry of Finance and Customs in cooperation w i th the Bank of Norway. Most current payments are exempt from ex- change control, provided that they are made through authorized banks in accordance with the currency pre- scriptions issued by the Bank of Norway. Authority to conduct most current payments has been delegated to authorized banks, which report such payments to the Bank of Norway. Import and export licenses, when required, are issued by the Ministry of Trade and Shipping and, in certain cases, by the Ministry of Agriculture or the Ministry of Fisheries. Prescription of Currency Settlements with all countries may be made in any convertible currency, including Norwegian kroner in Convertible Krone Accounts (see section on Nonresident Accounts, below). Nonresident Accounts The main type of nonresident account is the Convert- ible Krone Account. Such accounts may be held by residents of all countries. They may be credited with authorized payments from any country, with transfers from other Convertible Krone Accounts, and w i th proceeds from the sale in Norway of convertible curren- cies. They may be debited for authorized payments from 396 any country to residents of No rway, for transfers to other Convertible Krone Accounts, and for purchases in Norway of any foreign currency. Authorized banks are permitted to open foreign exchange accounts for nonresi- dents, subject to the regulations on such accounts (see section on Capital, be low ) .1 Imports and Import Payments Most commodities do not require an import license, but all imports from South Africa are subject to licens- ing. Certain textiles and garments are subject to import licensing for surveillance purposes. Following Norway's accession to the current Multi-Fiber Agreement on Ju ly 1, 1984, the global quotas formerly in force under Article XIX of the GATT are being phased out. In this connection, Norway has concluded bilateral agreements with 16 textile suppliers. Besides textile products, there are licensing requirements for a few industrial import items from Japan and the Republic of Korea, and for certain additional products from Ta iwan .t With these exceptions, industrial goods may be imported freely upon presentation of the original invoice. Imports of certain agricultural goods are restricted, irrespective of origin. A global quota list contains a few quotas for agricultural products for which imports are permitted up to fixed limits; these quotas apply to all countries. New and secondhand ships other than ships that are 20 years old or older and certain categories of fishing vessels may be imported freely, but special permission is required in order to ensure compliance with the regulations regarding payments in advance of delivery. The import of radio equipment and radio control equipment is subject to approval by the Direc- torate of Telecommunications. The import of a small number of commodities is prohibited for health and similar reasons, and certain goods (some grains, alco- holic beverages, fishing gear made of textile materials, pharmaceutical products, and drugs) are imported by government monopolies. Payments for Invisibles Payments to any country for all current invisibles, including income from capital and contractual amortiza- tion, may be made freely. There are no limits on the basic exchange allowance for tourist travel abroad. For business travel, the banks may sell reasonable amounts. Each person leaving Norway may take w i th him up to NKr 5,000 in Norwegian bank notes. Nonresidents leaving Norway may, in addition, export any foreign bank notes brought into the country by them. 'Residents also may open foreign exchange accounts. The customer must have both income and expenditure in foreign currencies. Holdings in these accounts must not exceed the amount required to cover obligations due in the immed ia te f u t u r e. tSee Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part Two, page 75. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Exports and Export Proceeds Most goods may be exported freely to any country against a declaration or a license. Exports subject to regulation are listed and require export licenses. Exports valued at not more than NKr 2,000 to any country are exempt from declaration or export license; for arms and ammun i t ion th is limit is NKr 500, and for fish and fish products, Nkr 1,000. If payment is not received w i th in 12 months of delivery, a license from the Bank of Norway is re- quired. In principle, all exchange from exports must be surrendered. Proceeds from Invisibles In principle, receipts from inv is ib les must be surren- dered. A person entering Norway may bring in any amount in Norwegian currency and in other means of payment. Capital Inward transfers of capital and investments in Norway by nonresidents must be approved by the Bank of Norway. The regulation of inward direct inves tment in connection with transfers of share capital is limited to a reporting system. Outward transfers of capital require individual licenses; the granting of these licenses de- pends on the merits of the case. Licenses for outward transfers of proceeds from the sale or l iqu ida t ion of investments made in Norway by nonresidents are granted freely, and nonresident capital may be repatriated auto- matically. Payments for contractual amortization are also permitted free ly. Nonresidents are allowed to purchase nonquoted as well as quoted shares w i th in the l im it of the Concession Acts and the respective companies' Articles of Association. However, permission for foreigners to purchase Norwegian bonds (w i th in specified l im i t s) has been revoked. Personal capital transfers, such as transfers re la t ing to fam i ly loans, g i f ts, inheritances, legacies, dowr ies, emigrants' assets, savings of nonresident workers, and amounts in settlement of imm ig ran ts' debts, may be made free ly. In general, resident-owned capital assets abroad, other than securities, real estate, and other authorized invest- ments, have to be surrendered. Norwegian shipowners, insurance companies, and brokers may open accounts with foreign banks; upon special permission from the Bank of No rway, other Norwegian firms may also hold such accounts. Applications for capital transfers to make direct investments abroad are treated l ibera l ly. Residents are allowed to purchase quoted and nonquoted foreign shares. However, purchase of nonquoted shares requires a license. Norwegian citizens are allowed to buy foreign bonds w i th in a l im it of NKr 1 m i l l ion a person and NKr 5 million a firm. Residents may, upon app l ica t ion, transfer capital abroad to purchase real estate for recrea- tional purposes. NORWAY There are no nominal l im i ts on authorized bank s' borrowing abroad, but authorized banks have to balance their combined spot and forward positions in foreign currency at the end of the day w i th in narrow marg ins vary ing between banks according to the size of their total assets. Banks are permitted to hold positions in any currency that is covered in other currencies. A license from the M in is t ry of Finance and Customs is required to raise bond loans in foreign countries. Borrowing abroad in connection w i th imports of ships must be approved by the M in is try of Trade and Ship- p ing. All other inward transfers of capital by nonbank residents require approval by the Bank of No rway. Incurring or providing guarantee obligations abroad also requires approval by the Bank of Norway. W i th the exception of loans to the petroleum sector, shipping, and shipyards, new foreign borrowing by Norwegian com- mercial enterprises must be w i th in overall l im i ts speci- fied for 1985 as the equ iva lent of NKr 3.0 b i l l ion for short-term loans and NKr 2.2 b i l l ion for med ium- and long-term loans.2 Gold Residents may freely purchase, ho ld, and sell gold in any form. No customs duties or other charges or fees are payable on imports or exports of gold bu l l ion and gold coin not contained in jewelry. Domestic sales of gold bu l l ion and gold coin are subject to the regular value- added tax at a rate of 20 percent. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement September 9. On the basis of an Act enacted on May 24, 1985, re la t ing to Norges Bank and the monetary sys tem, and as a forma l iza t ion of prevailing practice, rules were issued, stating that a swing margin of ± 2.25 percent around the actual va lue of the exchange rate index would be permitted. However, the Norges Bank could legally refra in from intervention even when the exchange rate exceeded the m ax imum stipulated ma rg in. It was also announced that un t il fur ther notice, the Norges Bank wou ld intervene in the exchange market as necessary to keep the exchange index for the Norwe- gian krone in the upper quartile of the sw ing ma rg in, i . e ., between 101 .13 and 102.25.

Oman avails itself of wider margins. The Central Bank of Oman maintains fixed buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar; on Decem- ber 31, 1985 these rates were RO 1 = US$0.34505 and RO 1 = US$0.34574, respectively. The commercial banks' rates for other currencies are based on market rates in London. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Oman informed the Fund on June 19, 1974 that it formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sec- tions 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control Exchange control authority is vested in the Central Bank, but there is no exchange control legislation in Oman. Prescription of Currency All settlements with Israel and South Africa are prohibited, and the use of their currencies is also prohibited. No other prescription of currency require- ments are in force. Nonresident Accounts No distinction is made between accounts held by residents and those held by nonresidents. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Israel and South Africa are pro- hibited. Imports of a few commodities are prohibited for reasons of health, security, or public policy. In addition, companies operating in Oman and trading in manufac- tured oil products are prohibited from importing such products as long as the domestic refinery is deemed by Oman to be producing the specified products in quan- tities that satisfy local demand. Licenses are required for imports; exchange for payments abroad for authorized imports may be obtained freely. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited, and exports or re-exports of live animals and foodstuffs 'On January 25, 1986 the exchange rate of the rial Omani was adjusted from RO 1 - US$2.89524 to RO 1 = US$2.6008, representing a devaluation of 10.17 percent. may be prohibited in times of shortage in Oman. All other commodities may be exported freely. There are no requirements attached to receipts from exports or re- exports; the proceeds need not be repatriated or surren- dered, and they may be disposed of freely, regardless of the currency involved. Exports of Maria Theresa dollars are prohibited. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments for and proceeds from invisibles are not restricted. Payments must not, however, be made to or be received from Israel or South Africa. Travelers may bring in or take out any amount in domestic or foreign bank notes. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or payments by residents or nonresidents, except that no payments may be made to or received from Israel or South Africa. Investment in business firms in Oman by foreign physical or juridical persons requires prior approval. Such investment is regulated by a foreign investment law enacted in June 1983, and by a law for the Organization and Encouragement of Industry, which came into effect on January 15, 1979. Under the 1983 foreign investment law, joint ventures are offered a five- year tax holiday, renewable for an additional period of five years under certain conditions; the Oman Devel- opment Bank can provide medium- and long-term loans at preferential interest rates for project financing in petroleum, agricultural, fishery, and mineral sectors; and assistance in preinvestment research can also be given. Foreign investment is not permitted in trade and ser- vices, and foreign capital is encouraged to be directed to large production or manufacturing projects. Gold The monetary authorities and authorized resident and nonresident banks may, without license, purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form at home or abroad. They may also import and export gold in any form without a license and without payment of any customs duties or tax. Transactions involving Israel and South Africa are prohibited.

Not for Redistribution PAKISTAN (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Pakistan is the Pakistan Rupee, for which the U .S. dollar is the intervention currency. A managed floating exchange rate system is operated, under which the State Bank of Pakistan (the central bank) sets on a daily basis the rate at which it will purchase and sell U .S. dollars in its dealings w i th authorized dealers. On December 31, 1985 the State Bank's buy ing and selling rates for transactions with authorized dealers were PRs 15.9800 and PRs 15.9956, respectively, per US$1. All transactions with the public in foreign exchange must be conducted through autho- rized dealers and money changers, whose dealings must be effected at rates authorized by the State Bank. In calculating spot exchange rates for other currencies, a margin of 0.0625 percent is provided on either side of the mean rate based on the previous day's closing buy ing and selling rates for the currency concerned in the New York market. Authorized dealers in Pakistan are permitted to cover their requirements of specified currencies in foreign exchange markets abroad. They may also cover their permitted transactions in specified currencies against U .S. dollars or Pakistan rupees, either spot or forward for a limited period, with their agents in the countries concerned. In addition, they offer forward cover in the currencies of member countries for exports and imports effected under the Asian Clearing Union arrangement, with the State Bank standing ready to cover forward contracts reported by authorized dealers. Beginning from August 1, 1985, interest-bearing cer- tificates called Foreign Exchange Bearer Certificates (FEBC) can be purchased only in foreign exchange by foreigners and Pakistanis. Denominated in Pakistan rupees, FEBCs can be freely taken in and out of the country, and can be encashed at any time in Pakistan rupees or in foreign exchange at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of the encashment. These certifi- cates are intended to provide a vehicle for residents freely to undertake current and capital transactions. Administration of Control The State Bank has delegated authority to a number of banks and financial institutions to deal in all foreign currencies, to supervise surrender requirements, and to sell exchange for specified purposes within limits pre- scribed by the State Bank. The Chief Controller of Imports and Exports is responsible for the issue of licenses and permits, as well as the implementation of import and export policies. Certain foreign trade transac- tions are conducted through various state-trading agen- cies, such as the Trading Corporation of Pakistan, Ltd. (TCP), the Cotton Export Corporation, Ltd. (CECP), and the Rice Export Corporation, Ltd. (RECP). 400 Prescription of Currency Exchange receipts and payments abroad must be effected through an authorized foreign exchange dealer, in principle, in any convertible currency or in Pakistan rupees from or to nonresident rupee bank accounts. Certain settlements with specified countries are chan- neled through special accounts. Letters of credit for imports from all other countries must be established in foreign currency or in Pakistan rupees for credit to a nonresident bank account of the country of the beneficiary or of the country of origin or shipment of goods. Trade transactions under "barter" agreements are settled through special accounts in inconvertible curren- cies. Trade in specified commodities with Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Poland, Sweden, and the U .S .S .R. is settled through special nonconvertible accounts. The special accounts with the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Sweden, and the U .S .S .R. are maintained in nonconvertible U .S. dollars, and the special account with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is denominated in deutsche mark. Payments to and from the Islamic Republic of Iran and Turkey relating to visible trade (excluding border trade and defense materials) are settled through clearing accounts maintained by the respective central banks in U .S. dollars. Payments to, and receipts from, member countries of the Asian Clearing Union other than the Islamic Republic of Iran ( i .e ., Bangladesh, Burma, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka) in respect of current transactions (other than those relating to petroleum, natural gas, and their products) may be effected through the Asian Clearing Union in Asian Monetary Units or in the domestic currency of one of the member countries involved in such transactions. No exchange control is exercised over transactions with A fghan is tan, and set- tlements are made in Pakistan rupees or in Afghan currency.

Accounts of residents of India, other than the accounts of the Indian Embassy and its personnel, are blocked. Pakistani nationals residing abroad and foreign nation- als, whether resident abroad or in Pakistan, and firms and corporations and charitable bodies owned by persons who are otherwise eligible to open foreign currency accounts may open foreign currency accounts with banks in Pakistan without prior approval of the exchange control authorities. There are no restrictions on the currencies in which the accounts may be denominated; credit balances may be transferred abroad, and interest on such accounts is exempt from income tax. A deposit holder wishing to make payments in Pakistan must first convert the foreign exchange drawn from his account into Pakistan rupees. If a Pakistani national holding such an account returns to Pakistan, he may retain the account unless his stay exceeds three years; thereafter, the account must be closed and the exchange surrendered. Banks in Pakistan receiving such deposits must sell the foreign exchange to the State Bank. Beginning from August 1985, authorized dealers under the foreign currency accounts facility can accept term deposits in foreign currency from banks operating abroad, including financial institutions owned by them; such term deposits must be at least US$10 million (or equivalent in other currencies), for a maturity period of at least one year. Imports and Import Payments The 1985/86 Import Policy Order (IPO) outlines the regulations applicable to imports.2 The IPO divides imports into two categories: prohibited imports and restricted imports. All imports which do not appear either on the prohibited (negative) list or restricted list are freely importable. The negative list consists essen- tially of items banned for religious, security, or lux- ury consumption reasons; capital and consumer goods banned temporarily for protective reasons; and inter- mediate goods used mainly in the production of capital and consumer goods banned for protective reasons.3 The restricted list of imports consists of five categories: (1) 29 items or categories of goods importable only by the public sector; (2) 20 items or categories importable only from specified sources under credits, barter trade, loans, or the U .S. P.L. 480 program; (3) consumer items (arms and ammunition, butter, condensed, preserved, and powdered milk, milk food for infan ts, malted milk, and Ovaltine or similar products) subject to quantitative restrictions; (4) 25 items or categories of goods import- able subject to specified requirements, such as a permit Effective Ju ly 1, 1983, the 1983/84 IPO instituted a basic change in the import regime, from a positive l ist system to a negative list system. 3 Some categories of curren t ly prohibited imports fall outside these categories ( i . e ., some prohibited items are not produced in Pakistan and they do not fit into the category of goods banned for religious, security, or luxu ry consumption reasons). PAKISTAN by a public sector agency or fu lf i l lment of technical specifications; and (5) lists of items importable by specific industries or other users only. Imports of some items on the negative list are permitted under certain circumstances, principally by export industries, public sector agencies, or under the personal baggage scheme. All imports require license permits, except goods im- ported by the Central Government for defense or other purposes, goods in transit, personal baggage, certain imports over the land routes from Afghanistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran, and certain other items per- mitted under a Ministry of Commerce Notification. Licenses are issued on the basis of notification by the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports.4 Generally, licenses remain valid for 12 months, but when machi- nery is specifically manufactured, licenses can be ob- tained with a validity period of up to 24 months. Licenses for imports are subject to a fee of 2 percent of the value of the license, payable at the time of issue. The import regime is subject to certain other supple- mentary qualifications, the most important of which are as follows: (1) Imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited, as are imports of goods originating in these countries but shipped from third countries. The private sector can import from India 42 specified items.

(3) Special provisions exist for the import by export industries of items on the restricted (tied) list from nontied sources and items on the negative list. Machinery on the negative list may also be imported by nonexporting industries up to specified amounts.

Not for Redistribution PAKISTAN Except for imports of books, journa ls, periodicals, and magazines, irrevocable letters of credit must be opened for all commercial imports. In principle, such letters of credit have to be opened w i th in 60 days after registration of the license w i th the State Bank of Pakistan for private and public sector imports, or in the case of imports under barter agreements w i th in such period as may be specified in related official Public Notices. For imports under tied loans or credits, which require that the contract be approved by the Economic Affairs Division or another specified agency, licenses for both private and public sector imports remain valid for the opening of a letter of credit for 30 days after final approval of the contract. Oil companies and refineries are free to open letters of credit for the import of crude oil and petroleum products within the validity period of the underlying license. Remittances are not normally permitted before shipping documents are received, but in special cases, e .g ., machinery and other capital goods for which deposits have to be paid to foreign manufacturers, the State Bank of Pakistan may authorize advance pay- ments for a part of the value of the goods. Autho- rized dealers may also make advance remittances, without prior approval of the State Bank, for imports of books, magazines, and journals by commercial importers. No payments are permitted for goods originating in or consigned from Israel or South Africa. With specified exceptions,5 the State Bank of Pakistan requires banks to take m in imum margins against import letters of credit at the following rates: 25 percent for milk and cream (including baby food) and butter; and 35 percent for all items not listed above. Imports by the TCP are exempt from the margin requirements on import letters of credit. However, domestic letters of credit opened in favor of the TCP in relation to the import of any commodities through the TCP (except bleaching powder and imports under the Raw Material Replenishment (RMR) Scheme) are subject to the same minimum margin requirements as are prescribed for import letters of credit for these commodities. 5Industrial raw materials imported by industrial or commercial users, industrial machinery (including all capital goods but excluding consumer durables), agricultural machinery and components and spares of such machinery, raw materials used by iron, steel, and shipbreaking industries, all raw materials imported by manufacturers of electrical equipment, capital goods and engineering goods ( inc lud ing cycles and agricultural implements), chassis of trucks, buses, jeeps in completely knocked-down condition, construction and engineering equ ipmen t, medicines, drugs, and medical and surgical equipment and appliances, pharmaceutical raw materials, medicinal herbs and crude drugs, X-ray films, artificial limbs and hearing aids and parts thereof, raw materials imported by manufacturers of fertilizers and pesticides, raw materials imported by the vegetable, ghee, and edible oil indus try, crude oil and petroleum products, newsprint, vegetable seeds, onions, tea, books, magazines, journals and periodicals, secondhand c lo th ing, raw ju te, ju te bags, cement, items on the tied list, imports under barter, pulses, raw materials against import licenses issued under the Export Performance Scheme (RMR ), motorcycles and motor scooters and auto-rickshaws (completely knocked-down condi- t ion) imported by firms which have been given sanction for "progres- sive" manufacture under the deletion program, potatoes, all live an ima ls other than swine, and cars for disabled persons. 402 Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles are controlled by the State Bank of Pakistan and in many cases require its prior approval. No remittances are permitted to Israel or South Afr ica. Authorized dealers may sell exchange or make remittances in accordance with the regulations. Certain remittances of a personal nature are subject to annual quotas, but applications in excess of the quotas may be approved at the discretion of the State Bank. Remit- tances by Pakistani nationals to their families abroad require special authorization. Payments for invisibles connected with imports are generally given the same treatment as that accorded to the underlying trade transaction. Except with respect to certain aid shipments, transport insurance must be taken out with insurance companies in Pakistan. Commissions, brokerage, or other trade charges paid to foreign import- ers or agents by Pakistani exporters are generally limited to a max imum of 5 percent of the invoice value, except for cotton, rice, and cement, for which separate regula- tions apply. The remittance of dividends declared out of current profits is allowed freely to foreign shareholders where the investment was made with the Government's ap- proval. With the approval of the State Bank of Pakistan, profits of branches of foreign companies may be remitted to their head offices. The same applies to head office expenses charged to a branch's profit and loss account and accepted for tax purposes by the Pakistani income tax authorities. Authorized dealers may sell foreign exchange up to US$1,000 a person every two years for private travel irrespective of the number of days spent abroad;6 this allocation can be used in installments. In addition to this quota each traveler is allowed US$50 a trip. Additional exchange for business travel, medical treatment, education, and sponsored cultural trips may be granted on an individual basis. Student maintenance allowances for study abroad range from US$4,199 to US$6,843 depending on region. Student allowances can be drawn through authorized dealers without requiring State Bank approval. Allowances for professional train- ing abroad range from US$750 a month for junior executives to US$1,200 a month for senior executives. There are also specific allowances for pilgrims' travel to Saudi Arabia. Exporters of goods with annual export earnings in excess of PRs 2.5 million and exporters of services in excess of PRs 0.25 million are entitled to a renewable one-year blanket permission for the purchase of travel tickets and travel exchange of US$150 a day up to US$4,500 for each business trip. Foreigners leaving Pakistan within six months from the date of their arrival in Pakistan may take out foreign currency not exceeding the amounts they brought in (including foreign currency notes up to the equivalent of US$500 a person, subject to a maximum of US$2,000 a family) and PRs 100 a person in Pakistan currency notes. 6The allowances for travel to India and Bangladesh are less; there is no allowance for travel to A fghan is tan. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Residents leaving for Afghanistan may take out any amount of Afghan currency. Nationals working abroad who visit Pakistan may retain for three months the foreign exchange they brought in. When leaving Pakis- tan w i th in three months from the date of arrival, they may take with them the unspent balance of foreign exchange (including foreign currency notes up to the equivalent of US$500 a person subject to a maximum of US$2,000 a fam i ly). Larger amounts of foreign currency notes can be taken out if the currency notes were declared on entry. Residents traveling to other foreign destinations may take out PRs 100 a person in Pakistan currency and any amount in foreign currency notes and traveler's checks sold by authorized banks under general authority delegated to them or under permission issued by the State Bank. Foreigners may make family remit- tances of up to 50 percent of net income or US$750 a month, whichever is higher. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of specified commodities to any destination and all exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited.7 Exports of most other commodities are allowed freely. However, certain specified exports are subject to export quotas (for example, maize, gram, camels, and split gram), quality controls (such as batteries, electric bulbs and appliances, and oil cakes), or m in imum export prices (such as hand-knotted carpets up to 96 knots and certain varieties of onyx blocks). The Cotton Export Corporation (CECP) has a monopoly over exports of cotton although private exporters may act as its agents; rice is exported through the Rice Export Corporation (RECP), and cement through the State Cement Corpora- tion. Chemical fertilizers can be exported also by the private sector un i ts. Goods consigned to India can be exported only by public sector agencies. The State Bank requires a declaration by the exporter that payment will be received in accordance with the prescribed method and within the prescribed period of time except for goods manufactured in the export processing zones. The authorized dealer certifies the export form for shipment. Exporters are obliged to collect and surrender export proceeds within four months of shipment, although the State Bank may allow an extension of this period. Exporters may, however, with the prior approval of the State Bank, grant deferred payment terms. The surrender of Afghan currency accruing from exports to Afghanistan is not required. Export financing at concessional rates is provided for all exports, with the exception of 25 specified items8 7Prohibited exports include ferrous and nonferrous metals (exclud- ing iron and steel manufactured goods), edible oils, grains, dairy products, animal fats, beef, mutton, timber, certain hides and skins, pulses and beans, wet blue leather made from cowhides and calfhides, wheat bran, wheat straw, and charcoal. 8The exceptions are: raw cotton; cotton yarn; fish other than frozen and preserved; mutton and beef; petroleum products; crude vegetable material; wool and animal hair; crude animal material; feedstuff for animals; all grains including grain flour; stone, sand, and gravel; waste and scrap of all kinds; fertilizer crude; oilseeds, nu ts, and kernels; pearls and precious stones; jewelry exported under the Entrustment Scheme; live animals; hides and skins; wet blue leather; inorganic elements, oxides, etc.; crude minerals; works of art and antiques; all metals; fur skins; and wood in rough or squared form. PAKISTAN based on irrevocable letters of credit or firm export orders on a case-by-case basis under Part I of the Export Finance Scheme,9 or, alternatively, on the basis of the previous year's export performance of the exporter as advance limit on a revolving basis under Part II of the scheme. Compensatory export rebates are paid on the f .o .b. value of textile exports, engineering goods, and other exports as follows: grey cloth, poultry, fresh fruits and flowers, acetate yarn, artificial leather products (7.5 percent); finished cloth, made-up textiles containing at least 50 percent cotton by weight, blended or woolen textiles (10 percent); leather goods, hand-knotted carpets and canvas footwear, engineering goods (including domestically produced engineering goods supplied lo- cally against international tender), surgical instruments, sporting goods, cutlery, specified PVC products, repair work performed on foreign vessels in the Karachi shipyard, plastic products, marble manufactured prod- ucts, glass bottles, and canned fruits (12.5 percent). A rebate of 55 percent is available against the tax payable on income attributable to the sales proceeds from exports of goods manufactured in Pakistan. In- dustrial units established under the Pay-As-You-Earn Scheme are permitted to utilize up to 50 percent of the f .o .b. value of exports for the servicing of suppliers' credit on imports of plant and machinery. Export duties are levied on staple cotton, oil cakes, molasses, semi- tanned hides and skins, crushed bones, and onyx blocks. Proceeds from Invisibles With the exception of Afghan currency, which may be retained, incoming foreign exchange derived from invis- ibles must be surrendered within three months. Travelers may bring in PRs 100 in Pakistan currency notes a person and PRs 5 in coin that is legal tender in India. There is no limitation on the import of other currency notes and coin. Capital Investments in Pakistan by nonresidents are subject to approval. In order to encourage industrial development in Pakistan, the Government follows a liberal policy toward foreign entrepreneurs, who, with the approval of the Government, may start any industry in the private sector without conditions being laid down regarding the participation of local capital. It is expected, however, that local rupee expenditure will ordinarily be met from local equity capital. Repatriation facilities are as follows: (1) Foreign capital invested in approved industries established after September 1, 1954 may be repatriated at any time to the extent of the original investment, and current profits may be transferred without restriction to the country of origin of the capital. (2) Profits reinvested in approved indus- trial projects with the sanction of the Government may be treated as investment for the purpose of subsequent repatriation. (3) Appreciation of any capital investment 9Under specified conditions authorized dealers may grant conces- sional finance without State Bank of Pakistan approval and without an irrevocable letter of credit or firm export order. 403 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PAKISTAN under (1) and (2) may also be treated as investment for the purpose of subsequent repatriation. These repatria- tion facilities do not apply to the purchase of shares on the stock exchange, unless the purchase is an integral part of an approved investment project, or to capital invested in Pakistan before September 1, 1954. Guaran- tees provide for just and fair compensation in the currency of the country of origin of the investment in the event of nationalization of any project. Foreign nationals in Pakistan or abroad may register their investments in National Prize Bonds issued by the Government of Pakistan; the principal in such transac- tions can be repatriated at any time, but the prize funds are treated as savings for the purpose of exchange control regulations on outward transfers. Transfers of capital abroad by resident nationals are, in general, not permitted; the purchase of foreign securities by Pakistani residents requires approval by the State Bank of Pakistan. Detailed rules govern the transfer of capital by persons emigrating or retiring from Pakistan, depending upon the nationality of the person concerned and the country to which the transfer is to be made. Foreign nationals temporarily residing in Pakistan are treated as nonresidents for purposes of transfer of securities. General permission has been given in connec- tion with the issue, sale, or transfer of Pakistan securi- ties, excluding shares of public or private limited companies, in favor of nonresidents, provided that the securities are registered at the address in Pakistan of the purchaser and investment is made on the basis of nonrepatriation of capital and return. Pakistan securities held by nonresidents may be transferred to other nonresi- dents against payment abroad, subject to the same terms and conditions as those applicable to the transferor. A general permission has also been issued allowing foreign nationals temporarily resident in Pakistan to make investments in units of the National Investment Trust, subject to certain stipulations. Exports of securities are subject to approval. Proceeds accruing from the liquidation of nonresident capital assets that are not covered by repatriation arrangements must be credited to blocked accounts. Subject to ap- proval by the State Bank of Pakistan, balances in blocked accounts may be invested in approved govern- ment securities payable in Pakistan rupees or placed as time deposits with banks. A general permission allows Pakistani nationals resi- dent abroad to acquire securities in Pakistan by remit- tance of foreign exchange or by debiting their foreign currency accounts in Pakistan; dividends or interest thereon, as well as the proceeds upon sale, may be transferred abroad, provided that these securities were held for no less than one year. Pakistani nationals require the prior approval of the State Bank of Pakistan to sell movable or immovable assets held abroad, and the liquidation proceeds must be repatriated to Pakistan through normal banking channels. 404 Gold The export and import of gold are prohibited unless authorized by the State Bank of Pakistan. Such permis- sion is normally not granted. However, under a special scheme, jewelry manufacturers are allowed to import gold for the purpose of manufac tur ing jewelry for export. Banks incorporated in Pakistan are not permitted to engage in purchases or sales of bullion whether in or outside Pakistan. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement August 1.

Not for Redistribution PANAMA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Panama is the Panamanian Balboa, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar at B 1 = US$1. The U.S. dollar is legal tender and circulates freely in Panama; locally issued currency is represented by balboa coin and several commemorative coins. Commercial banks quote buying and selling rates for certain other currencies based on the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar in markets abroad. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. On November 26, 1946 Panama notified the Fund that it accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2 , 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control Most import and export licenses are issued by the Price Regulation Office, a semiautonomous institution of the Panamanian Government. The Price Regulation Office is responsible for the implementation of restric- tions on imports of commodities that compete with national production and on certain exports. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry determines the import quotas for commodities listed in trade agreements; the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, jointly with the Price Regulation Office, determines the import quotas for certain agricultural commodities. Prescription of Currency There are no prescription of currency requirements. Imports and Import Payments Quotas are imposed on imports of certain commodities competing with present or prospective domestic produc- tion; some of these are not being licensed. Import licensing also applies to imports of various foodstuffs. Other imports are free. Imports by the public sector, however, are subject to special requirements. Payments abroad may be made freely. In addition to import duty, a tax of 7.5 percent of the f .o .b. value is levied on private sector imports of all dutiable goods other than specified pharmaceutical prod- ucts and foodstuffs, for which the rate is 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively; books are exempt. Most imports are also subject to a tax of 5 percent calculated on the sum of the c . i . f. value and all other import taxes and charges; among the exemptions are fuels, lubricants, and related products, as well as foodstuffs, specified medicinal and pharmaceutical products, and imports into the Free Zone. Exports and Export Proceeds Export taxes are levied on gold, silver, platinum, manganese, and other minerals, sugar, bananas, coco- nuts, scrap metals, pearls, animal wax, nispero gum, ipecac root, and rubber. Exports of certain foodstuffs, firearms, and ammunition are prohibited. Certain non- traditional exports are eligible for tax credit certificates. The proceeds of exports are not subject to exchange control. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments for and proceeds from invisibles are not restricted. A travel tax of 4 percent is levied on air and sea tickets bought in Panama or on such tickets pur- chased for travelers starting their trip in Panama. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or payments by residents or nonresidents. Several foreign-controlled banks are authorized to con- duct business only with nonresidents. Gold Panama has issued two commemorative gold coins with face values of B 100 and B 500, which are legal tender but do not circulate. Residents may freely hold gold in any form, at home or abroad, and may freely negotiate gold in any form with residents or nonresi- dents, at home and abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry carried as personal effects by travelers are subject to license if made by residents other than the monetary authorities; import licenses are issued freely by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and export licenses are granted by the Ministry of Finance and Treasury. Exports of unworked gold pro- duced in Panama are subject to an export duty of 1 percent ad valorem, and exports of gold coin (other than U .S. coins, which are exempt) are subject to a duty of 0.5 percent. Changes During 1985 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 406 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PAPUA NEW GUINEA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Papua New Guinea is the Papua New Guinea Kina. The exchange rate of the kina in terms of the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, is adjusted daily on the basis of its relationship to a weighted basket of currencies representing Papua New Guinea's major trading partners. On December 31, 1985 the official buying and selling rates quoted by the Bank of Papua New Guinea for the U .S. dollar were US$0.9885 and US$0.9869, respectively, per K 1. The commercial banks, the only authorized foreign exchange dealers, publish rates for all current transactions w i th their customers, within a max imum spread of 2 percent between buying and selling. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Papua New Guinea formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from December 4, 1975. Administration of Control Foreign exchange control is administered by the Bank of Papua New Guinea under the Central Banking (Foreign Exchange and Gold) Regulations, Chapter 138. Overall policy is determined by the Government with the advice of the Bank of Papua New Guinea and the Ministry of Finance. The Bank of Papua New Guinea has delegated considerable powers to the commercial banks operating in Papua New Guinea, which have been appointed authorized dealers in foreign exchange and gold. Export licensing is administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Prescription of Currency Contractual commitments, which are expressed in a foreign currency, to persons resident outside Papua New Guinea must be met by payments in foreign cu r rency .J Export proceeds may be received in any foreign currency or in kina from an overseas bank's account in Papua New Guinea. Nonresident Accounts The Bank of Papua New Guinea controls all credits to nonresident bank accounts; funds credited to such ac- counts may be withdrawn without further formality. Only in exceptional circumstances is approval given for a nonresident bank account to be denominated in a foreign currency. Imports and Import Payments Imports of a limited number of goods are restricted for health, security, and protective reasons. Certain import 'Foreign currencies are defined as all currencies other than the k ina. items are subject to quotas for reasons of domestic protection; quotas are adjusted quarterly, reflecting the extent to which local production can meet domestic demand. There are no import licensing requirements. Autho- rized dealers have powers to approve most transactions without referring to the Bank of Papua New Guinea. Normally, import payments should be settled within 90 days of the arrival of the goods in the country; approval for payment on extended credit terms is usually given for items such as capital goods. Payments for Invisibles Approval is readily given for most payments for invisibles, provided that supporting documentation can be produced. The remittance overseas of life insurance premiums on new policies written after December 31, 1975 in the names of permanent residents is not permitted. Applications for foreign exchange for foreign travel in excess of the equivalent of K 4,000 an adult and K 1,500 a minor a year for tourist travel and K 2,000 for each business trip are referred to the Bank of Papua New Guinea for consideration. Travelers may not take or send out of Papua New Guinea domestic currency in excess of K 200 in notes and K 5 in coin; however, domestic coins issued for numismatic purposes may be taken out freely. Overseas visitors are free to take out any currency which they had brought in and recorded on arrival. Exports and Export Proceeds Residents of Papua New Guinea may export goods without exchange control formality on condition that they comply with the terms of the general authority issued by the Bank of Papua New Guinea. The essential conditions of this authority are that payment for goods exported is received within six months of the date of export and that the proceeds are sold to an authorized dealer in Papua New Guinea. When exporters are not in a position to comply with the conditions of the general authority, they must apply to the Bank for a specific authority. No authority is needed for certain categories of goods, including sundry items such as passengers' personal effects. Export licenses are required for all types of goods under the Exports (Control and Valua- tion) Act. Special provisions are in force for the export of prescribed goods (logs, pearls, tuna fish, and wood chips). Specified commodities are subject to export levies. Proceeds from Invisibles Approval is required only for the disposal of foreign currency proceeds other than by sale to an authorized dealer in Papua New Guinea. Overseas visitors may bring in any amount of currency for travel expenditure. 407 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PAPUA NEW GUINEA Capital Outward transfers of overseas-owned capital are nor- mally allowed; advance commitments, however, are given only in exceptional circumstances. New invest- ment outside Papua New Guinea by permanent residents and by companies and other organizations operating in Papua New Guinea is subject to certain limitations. When an investment is for portfolio reasons, the amount that may be invested in a 12-month period is limited to K 10,000 a person. Investment may only be in the form of marketable company securities and real estate. The approval of the Bank of Papua New Guinea is needed for the acquisition and disposal of foreign securities by permanent residents.2 Persons who have been declared to be temporary residents by an authorized dealer or the Bank of Papua New Guinea may repatriate their surplus earnings without limit. Prior clearance from the tax authorities may be required for these transactions. Approval by the Bank of Papua New Guinea is required for all new or increased foreign investment in 2Foreign securities are defined in the Central Banking Act as including deposits in overseas bank accounts and debts due by persons outside Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea. In some cases the Bank of Papua New Guinea refers such applications to the Ministry of Finance. Foreign investments other than those in bank- ing and insurance are also subject to approval by the National Investment and Development Authority. Ap- proval from the Bank of Papua New Guinea is also necessary for the acknowledgment of indebtedness, so that a right to receive a payment may be conferred on a nonresident. Offshore borrowing by private sector entities in Papua New Guinea may not exceed the debt/ equity ratio of 3:1. Commercial banks may undertake offshore borrowing for on-lending to exporters, provided that no assumption of exchange risk is involved. Gold Under the Central Banking (Foreign Exchange and Gold) Regulations, Chapter 138, approval by the Bank of Papua New Guinea is necessary for the sale, purchase, export, and import of gold. Changes During 1985 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 408 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PARAGUAY (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Paraguay is the Paraguayan Guaran i. The exchange arrangement consists of four different exchange rates, three of wh ich are fixed by the Central Bank, while the four th, which is operated by commercial banks and exchange houses, fluctuates freely. An ex- change rate of 0 160 per US$1 applies to transactions related to the binational entities and to public sector capital and external debt service payments. A rate of 0 240 per US$1 applies to 50 percent of exports at m in imum prices, registered private capital transactions, imports of petroleum, fuel oil, and agricultural and industrial inputs. A rate of (fa 400 per US$1 is applied for the remaining 50 percent of proceeds from exports at minimum export prices. All other transactions ( i . e ., most non-oil import paymen ts, profit remittances, and private service payments) are channeled through the free exchange market. On December 31, 1985 the rate prevailing in this market was around 0 650 per US$1. A tax of 1V -2 percent is levied on purchases and sales of foreign exchange in the official market, except for trans- actions with foreign embassies and diplomats, with meat packing plants, and those relating to investments in Para- guay under the terms of Investment Law No. 550/75. A fee of 2 percent is levied on sales of foreign exchange for imports. In addition, banks charge a commission of 2 percent on all sales of foreign exchange and receive a commission of 1 percent on all sales of foreign exchange to the Central Bank. The Central Bank charges a commission of 1 percent on all sales of foreign exchange to the commercial banks that are authorized to operate in the exchange market. Additional selling rates result from the application of an 8 percent tax on the c . i . f. value of a wide range of consumer goods imported from nonmember countries of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA); a 10 percent tax on outward remittances of profits and divi- dends; and a 30 percent tax on outward remittances of interest, royalties, rent, honoraria, commissions, and other income accruing to nonresidents from Paraguayan sources. For interest payments on foreign loans con- tracted by national banks, the tax is applied only to the spread if floating rate loans are involved, and only to 6l/2 percent of interest on fixed-rate loans. There are no forward exchange facilities. The authorized banks are required to transfer all of their daily gross foreign exchange receipts in the official market to the Central Bank. The Central Bank charges the authorized commer- cial banks a fee of 1 percent on its sales of foreign exchange at the official exchange rate. Authorized banks are required to report their daily transactions to the Central Bank. Administration of Control The Central Bank determines foreign exchange policy and supervises, together with the Superintendency of Banks, the foreign exchange transactions carried out by the banks and the exchange houses. Prescription of Currency Payments between Paraguay and Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela are made through accounts maintained with the Central Bank of Paraguay and the other central banks concerned within the framework of the multilateral clearing system of the LAI A. Clearing takes place every four months, but Paraguay, as a relatively less developed country, may request special settlement every two months. There are no other prescription of currency requirements. Imports and Import Payments Imports of certain commodities require authorization; these include table wine in bu lk, natural grape must concentrate, rice in the husk or with any degree of processing, gasoline, diesel oil, gas oil, kerosene, wire, nails, dry cell batteries, and potatoes, garlic, and onions during local harvest seasons. Imports of wheat and wheat flour are made by the Ministry of Industry and Com- merce. The Central Bank operates a register of import- ers, consisting of four categories of priority for import goods. All imports are subject to a m in imum financing term of 120 days. Commercial banks are instructed not to establish letters of credit for importers unless these importers already have, from their own resources, the foreign exchange necessary to settle these external obligations. Surcharges calculated on the c . i . f. value are payable on most imports up to a maximum of 30 percent, depending on the customs specifications. Surcharges are collected by the banks at the time of delivery of docu- ments for customs clearance or when the import payment is made, whichever is earlier. The following are the principal import items exempt from surcharges: imports for religious, charitable, cultural, or educational pur- poses; imports for the Government; furniture acquired through inheritance; all imports exempted according to international treaties; and the accompanied baggage of international passengers or nationals returning to estab- lish residence in Paraguay. Also exempted are agricul- tural and industrial machinery and equipment imported through the Spanish free zone in Paraguay, agricultural machinery and equipment for the National Wheat Pro- gram, books and periodicals, and imports under Invest- ment Law No. 550/75; imports of investment goods and of new material for export industries are eligible for exemption on a case-by-case basis. Commodities origi- nating from neighboring countries are subject to a 10 percent surcharge on the c . i . f. value; this applies to foodstuff, textiles, footwear, and other manufac- tured consumer goods. Alcohol-powered automobiles, be settled at the rate of 0 240 per US$1, and the 409 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PARAGUAY tractors, and motorcycles are subject to only 60 percent of the surcharge established for vehicles with equivalent specifications using other fuels. Imports of a few commodities are prohibited or restricted, including commodities that may jeopardize national security and public order or public health. A wide range of import items are prohibited under Law No. 7804, including wild animals, refined oils, dairy products, cigars, soaps, matches, leather or plastic suitcases, paper stationary, fabrics, footwear, metal wires, nails, screws, bicycles, and furniture. The Minis- try of Finance may lift import restrictions on foodstuff (mostly produce) whenever domestic demand cannot be met through internal supply. Imports of specified goods (including television sets and precious metals) may not be financed with foreign credit. Imports on credit for a term of more than six months require approval from the Central Bank; such approval is normally granted only for imports of ma- chinery and other capital goods. Import payments must be made through banks, at the official rates of exchange, or at the rate prevailing in the parallel market. For certain commodities originating in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and Uruguay, and falling under the regional trade regime, import payments need not be channeled through banks; as long as proof of payment of the preferential tariff rates for these imports can be presented, payments may be effected with the importer's own foreign exchange. Payments for Invisibles Payments for current invisibles are settled at the free market rate, with the exception of government transac- tions, which are settled at 0 240 per US$1. Travelers may take out any amount in foreign or domestic currency. There is an ad valorem sales tax of 5 percent on international airline tickets. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of logs and rough beams and some other unprocessed forest products are prohibited, as are ex- ports of rawhides, horses, wild animals, sheep, goats, pigs, rabbits, and cement. Beef exports are subject to annual export quotas, and certain other exports require prior authorization in order to ensure adequate supplies for domestic consumption and to meet the needs of domestic industries. All other exports are free from licensing requirements, but some require a certificate issued by the Institute of Technology and Standards, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, or the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock. The proceeds of exports must be collected within 120 days after completion of the banking formalities related to the shipping documents; the foreign exchange rate must be converted at banks authorized to deal in exchange, and the proceeds must be surrendered at the exchange rate for the respective commodity. For all exports, the Central Bank establishes minimum export prices denominated in U.S. dollars. Exporters are 410 required to surrender, in the official exchange market, all the foreign exchange proceeds from their exports, which may not be less than the amount corresponding to the minimum price set by the Central Bank. Advance receipts of export proceeds must also be sold to autho- rized banks. All exports are exempted from taxes or charges. Proceeds from Invisibles Except for foreign exchange inflows from the bina- tional entities (which have to be transferred in fu ll to the Central Bank), there are no surrender requirements for proceeds from invisibles. Travelers may bring in any amount in foreign or domestic currency. Capital All inward and outward transfers must be channeled through the authorized banks or exchange houses. Banks may provide foreign exchange at the rate of 0 240 per US$1 for transfers of registered capital, subject to presentation of appropriate documentation. As a provi- sional measure the Central Bank limits annual sales of foreign exchange for the amortization of private sector debt to no more than 10 percent of the originally registered external liability. In addition, firms (including commercial banks) are prohibited, except when a sub- stantial hardship can be shown, from repatriating re- tained earnings. Under Investment Law No. 550/75, the Government can grant special tax, customs, and import surcharge concessions to proposed investments, pro- vided that these are duly registered and approved. Capital imported and registered under this law may be retransferred in the currency originally imported in installments of up to 20 percent from the third year after the beginning of production. Gold Under Decree Law No. 18/52, the Central Bank may prescribe the maximum amount of gold (and foreign exchange) that may be held by residents; this require- ment does not apply to amounts held by the Central Bank or by institutions authorized to deal in foreign curren- cies. In practice, residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, in Paraguay or abroad, and exchange houses may freely deal in gold coins, gold bars, and gold leaf with residents and nonresidents. Exports and imports of gold by nonbank residents and industrial users in any form other than jewelry require the prior approval of the Central Bank; payments for gold imports by industrial users must be made through authorized banks at the rate of <b 240 per US$1. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement February 13. The exchange system was modified as follows: (1) the Central Bank was authorized to sell foreign exchange in the free market to eliminate specula- tive fluctuations; (2) 50 percent of export proceeds at the minimum prices established by the Central Bank should ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution remaining 50 percent, at the rate of (fa 400 per US$1; and (3) commercial banks should sell to the Central Bank all foreign exchange proceeds from exports of soybeans, cotton, and their by-products. February 18. The exchange system was modified further as follows: (1) all public sector capital and external debt service payments and transactions related to the binational entities should be settled at the rate of (/j 160 per US$1; (2) all registered private transactions for imports of petroleum fuel oil and agricultural and industrial inputs should be settled at the rate of 0 240 per US$1; (3) all other imports, profit remittances, and service payments, as well as that part of export proceeds corresponding to the difference between the actual export price and the minimum export price determined by the Central Bank should be settled at the free market exchange rate; (4) all foreign exchange receipts from exports should be transferred daily to the Central Bank; and (5) cotton, soybeans, and their by-products were required to be exported with advance receipts of export proceeds (divisas anticipadas). February 27. The following regulations were in- troduced: (1) the Central Bank would charge commercial banks a Vi of 1 percent exchange fee and a 1 percent banking fee on every purchase of foreign exchange to cover imports and services by the Government; (2) commercial banks would be required to sell to the Central Bank on a daily basis at the prevailing exchange rates all the foreign exchange bought during the day, and a 1 percent fee would be paid on that operation to commercial banks; and (3) the Central Bank would charge a 1 percent exchange fee on all sales of foreign exchange to authorized commercial banks. April 16. The Exchange Commission (Comision de Cambios) of the Central Bank's Exchange Department was eliminated with effect from April 1, 1985. In addition, all applications from authorized commercial banks for purchases of foreign exchange should be directly forwarded to the Exchange Department of the Central Bank. July 28. It was announced that commercial banks were no longer required to forward to the Central Bank applications for official foreign exchange not conforming with Resolutions 1 and 2 of Law No. 80 of May 24, 1984. Imports and Import Payments January 4. Under Law No. 7804, the list of goods exempted from tariffs or subject to import prohibition or restrictions was specified, as well as the list of prohibited export goods. In addition, a flat 10 percent tariff was levied on imports originating from neighboring coun- tries, mostly foodstuff and nondurable consumer goods. PARAGUAY July 2. A regulation was introduced, requiring com- mercial firms engaged in import-related activities to register in the Central Bank's Importer Records. July 3. The following changes were made in import regulations: (1) importing firms would be allowed to import for a value up to double their individual capital; imports in excess of this limit should be backed by a guarantee from a bank operating in Paraguay; and (2) a minimum capital requirement of (& 10,000,000 was introduced for any firm applying to register in the Central Bank's Importer Records. November 4. Circular 73/85 was issued, prohibiting any firm or individual from engaging in import transac- tions without prior registration at the Central Bank's Importer Records. Presentation of a company balance sheet for each of the preceding three years was made obligatory for such registration; in the case of companies in business for less than three years, registration would be determined on the basis of reputation. In addition, it was reiterated that only authorized commercial banks were permitted to present import documents to the Central Bank. Exports and Export Proceeds February 18. Cotton ginners were required to report to the Central Bank by the fifteenth and thirtieth of each month on the quantities of raw cotton bought, the volume of fibers produced —classified by type of fiber— total exports of cotton fibers, sales of fibers to other firms, and to report on the existing stocks of cotton fibers; they were also required to apply to the Central Bank for an authorization to sell any cotton fiber to other exporting firms. May 27. A m in imum export price for an average type of cotton was set at US$935 per ton. June 28. Any commercial firm engaging in export activities was required to register in an Export Record, kept at the Central Bank. July 3. The following changes were made in export regulations: (1) a m in imum capital of (fc 10,000,000 would be required for any firm to register in the Export Record; (2) exporters could operate with letters of credit for up to a value of US$100,000 in each case; transac- tions beyond this amount should be made with anti- cipated foreign exchange; and (3) exports to countries with which Paraguay maintains bilateral credit agree- ments were excluded from this clause. November 15. Under Circular 76/85, it was an- nounced that foreign exchange proceeds from exports representing the difference between the actual sales price and the official m in imum export price would be credited to exporters to finance future expenditures related to exports. 411 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PERU (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Peru is the Peruvian Sol.l There are two exchange markets: (i) the official market in which the exchange rate for the Peruvian sol is pegged to the U .S. dollar at S/. 13,908 = US$1 (buying); and (ii) the Financial Exchange Market (free market), in which the rate fluctuates freely in response to supply and demand, and where the Central Bank may intervene by buying foreign exchange acquired by financial institutions from the free market. On December 31, 1985 the buying rate in the free market was S/. 17,321.05 = US$1. In addition, holders of U .S. dollar-denominated deposits, may convert them into soles at an exchange rate equivalent to that prevailing in the official market (selling), plus a premium of 3 percent. All transactions are handled through the official market, with the excep- tion of exchange purchases for travel, education, insur- ance, certain technical services, and personal remit- tances abroad, which are handled through the free market. Exchange market transactions in the official market may also be conducted in 14 currencies2 other than the U.S. dollar, on the basis of their exchange rates in terms of the U.S. dollar in the international market. Remittances by petroleum companies are made through the official market. All exchange transactions must be conducted through the banking system or recognized exchange dealers. An exchange tax of 1 percent is levied on foreign exchange proceeds from exports of goods and services, and on purchases of foreign exchange for imports of goods and services; a tax of 1A of 1 percent is levied on issues of U.S. dollar certificates of deposit. The Central Bank sets its selling rate in the official market with a 0.5 percent spread over the buying rate. Banks and dealers operating in the official market are required to limit the spread between their buying and selling rates on any given day to not more than 0.5 percent (excluding the spread arising from the 1 percent exchange tax). Residents are free to hold abroad their foreign ex- change receipts other than those from exports. If repatri- ated, such foreign exchange may be sold to the banking system, or be used to open foreign currency accounts or to acquire foreign currency certificates of deposit. Export proceeds, including loans for the prefinancing of exports, must be surrendered to the Central Reserve ^n February 1, 1985, the Peruvian authorities introduced a new currency (the inti, consisting of 100 centimos and equivalent to 1,000 soles), and announced, inter alia, that with effect from January 1, 1986, all operations in the financial system would be expressed in intis. 2Belgian francs, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, and Swiss francs for external trade transactions; for nontrade transactions, operations may also be effected in Austrian schillings, Canadian dollars, Norwegian kroner, Swedish kroner, and Venezuelan bolfvares. 412 Bank, which issues ten-day exchange certificates for 95 percent of the value of receipts from traditional exports (other than petroleum and its derivatives) and for 80 percent of receipts in the case of nontraditional exports. These exchange certificates are held by the surrendering bank (or any other bank to which they may be subsequently assigned) for use by the exporter for his own permitted foreign exchange payments and transfers or for conversion into soles at the official market rate of the day. If not so utilized within their maturity, the certificates are canceled, and the corresponding amount in soles is credited to the account of the bank at the buying rate in effect at the close of the preceding business day, minus a discount of 2 percent. For the 5 percent value of receipts from traditional exports and for the 20 percent of receipts from nontraditional exports, freely disposable ten-day exchange certificates are issued to the exporter by the Central Bank; the certificates may be converted into soles at the financial exchange market rate. Exporters of nontraditional products availing them- selves of subsidized credit from the Fund for Nontradi- tional Exports (PENT) are eligible for 180-day nontrans- ferable exchange certificates (PENT certificates) against the surrender of foreign exchange proceeds of preship- ment and postshipment credits received from abroad, provided that such foreign credits do not exceed 72 percent of the contemplated export value. Extensions of up to 360 additional days in the validity period of the certificates are permitted. PENT certificates remain in the custody of the Central Reserve Bank and bear interest at the LIB OR plus 5 percentage points for the duration of the foreign export financing; they are applied directly by the Central Reserve Bank for the cancellation of part of the PENT credit to the exporter in local currency. Upon surrender of export proceeds, the Central Reserve Bank issues a second set of exchange certificates for the direct cancellation of the PENT credit not covered by PENT certificates. For the remainder of the surrendered foreign exchange, the following procedure is followed: for up to 20 percent of the total export proceeds, freely disposable ten-day exchange certificates are issued to the exporter; for any remaining exchange surrendered, ten-day ex- change certificates are issued that are usable either for payments through the unified exchange market or for conversion into soles at the official market exchange rate. Peru formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement as from February 15, 1961. Administration of Control Export and import licenses are issued by the General Directorate of Foreign Trade in the Ministry of Industry, ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Commerce, Tourism, and Integration. The Central Re- serve Bank issues foreign exchange certificates against receipts from exports. The Import Supervision Commis- sion is the ultimate administrative authority on applica- tions for prior import licenses denied at a lower level and rules on the exclusion of importers from the National Register of Importers. It also exercises general surveil- lance over the flow of imports and their effects on domestic production and is empowered to make recom- mendations to the Import Valuation Commission. The latter Commission exercises surveillance over customs valuation and has the authority to purchase and auction off, or to impose special duties on, those imports deemed to be undervalued or dumped. Public sector imports valued at more than US$10,000 require the approval of the Board for External Transactions of the Public Sector and must be registered with the General Directorate of Foreign Trade. Public sector imports valued at more than US$50,000 require, in addition, a resolution of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, Tourism, and Integration. Borrowing abroad by the public sector, as well as borrowing abroad by the private sector with a govern- ment guarantee, is subject to prior approval by Supreme Decree, on the recommendation of the Committee of the External Debt and the National Planning Institute. Public enterprises are required to register their short-term indebtedness with the General Directorate of Public Credit (GDPC) and to obtain GDPC's approval for renewal, rollover, or consolidation of such debt. More- over, with effect from January 1983, the enterprises must submit their annual short-term borrowing programs to GDPC for approval. The National Commission on Investment and Foreign Technology (CONITE) supervises foreign direct investment in Peru and the use of foreign trademarks, patents, and licenses, as well as the related royalty payments. Most payments for invisibles require the approval of CONITE. Prescription of Currency All exchange market operations in the official market must be effected in one of the 15 prescribed convertible currencies, but exchange certificates may be issued by the Central Reserve Bank only in U .S. dollars. Payments between Peru and Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela must be made through accounts maintained with each other by the Central Reserve Bank of Peru and the other central banks concerned, within the framework of the multilateral clearing system of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA). Imports and Import Payments Import prohibitions apply to 531 commodities out of the approximately 5,300 eight-digit items of the Peru- vian customs nomenclature (NABANDINA). These com- modities include agricultural products, footwear, tex- tiles, and security-related materials. With the exception of imports valued at US$2,000 or less a year, a set of PERU 1,547 items specified by the General Directorate of Foreign Trade is importable only subject to prior approval (observation) from the appropriate ministry; they include items subject to public sector monopoly or deemed in need of protection or damaging to public welfare. Importers must be listed in the National Regis- ter of Importers. An import license for imports from countries of the Andean Pact is not required, nor is the listing of the importer in the National Register of Importers; the imports need only be registered with the General Directorate of Foreign Trade. Imports of raw materials and intermediate goods for the production of nontradi- tional exports are exempted from import duties and a specific import license is not required, provided that the appropriate ministry determines that such imports qual- ify under the Temporary Admission Regime. Certain industrial raw materials and fertilizers, as well as certain agricultural commodities, such as milk pow- der, may be imported only by the National Enterprise for Input Marketing (ENCl), and crude petroleum and petro- leum derivatives, only by PETROPERU, a state-owned enterprise. Imports of capital goods must be covered by irrevoca- ble documentary credits, and the intermediating bank must guarantee refunding of the foreign currency if the import is not effected by the time the relevant documen- tary credit expires. There are no minimum financing requirements for imports, and advance payments are permitted except for capital goods imported by firms with an annual turnover in excess of S/. 10 billion. With specified exemptions, imported goods are sub- ject to a uniform value-added tax of 11 percent of the c . i . f. value of imports (in addition to the import duty); exemptions from the value-added tax include agricultural products, certain minerals and fuels, medicines, fertiliz- ers, pesticides, agricultural equipment and tractors, aviation equipment and ships in excess of 1,000 tons, and items for personal use (including automobiles up to 2,000 cubic centimeters). In addition, a selective con- sumption tax (also in addition to the import duty) is levied on luxury items, ranging from 18 percent to 145 percent of the c . i . f. value. Under the 1980 customs tariff, as amended, the maximum import duty is 60 percent ad valorem, and the unweighted average rate is 57 percent.3 In addition, many imports are subject to one or both of the following taxes: (1) an additional import tax for the promotion of nontraditional exports of 1 percent of the c . i .f. value, and (2) a maritime freight tax of 10 percent of the ocean freight charges. However, certain goods originating in Andean Pact countries may be imported duty free. Public sector imports must, in principle, be shipped in Peruvian vessels. Payments for Invisibles Authorization of the Central Reserve Bank or other agencies is required for payments for invisibles eligible 3Including the 15 percent surcharge. 413 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PERU for foreign exchange in the official market. Such payments and transfers include those for medical treat- ment abroad, duly authorized official travel, registration of patents and trademarks, certain advertisement costs, banking services, profits from registered investments, income of nonresidents, pension or insurance contracts, and certain technical services. All other payments for invisibles (including most types of foreign travel) must be made through the free market. Remittance of net profits, including depletion and depreciation allowances, requires approval of CONITE and a prior tax clearance. In accordance with Andean Pact rules, the remittance of profits on foreign capital invested in Peru is, in principle, limited to 20 percent a year, although a higher percentage may be permitted for investments that generate employment, are in unde- veloped areas, or help to diversify exports.4 All pay- ments for royalties, patents, trademarks, and licenses require the prior approval of CONITE. Foreign-owned enterprises may not enter into new contracts to pay royalties to a foreign parent company or its affiliates. The effective interest rate on a new loan from a foreign parent company or its affiliate may not exceed by more than 3 percent the prevailing interest rate for first-class assets in the money market of the country in whose currency the transaction is conducted. Foreign invest- ment by petroleum and mining companies is subject to special contracts with the Peruvian Government. Pay- ments of capital and interest on external loans can be made through the official market if the funds had been converted into soles in the same market. Approval by the Foreign Exchange Committee of the Central Reserve Bank is required for purchases of foreign exchange for payments that have not been considered by the exchange regulations. Indicative limits on foreign exchange sales are established for medical treatment abroad. The Central Bank, through its Foreign Exchange Committee, may authorize purchases of ex- change in excess of the specified limits in justified cases. Exports and Export Proceeds Export prohibitions apply to 60 items, mainly rare wildlife or plants. Export licenses are required in 50 other cases. The Banco Minero del Peru is the principal exporter of uncut precious stones and pearls; MINPECO has a monopoly over exports of silver and other refined metals produced by the public enterprises; the Banco Minero has a monopoly over gold exports; and (since August 1985) PETROPERU has a monopoly over exports of petroleum derivatives. Exports of certain commodities specified by the General Directorate of Foreign Trade are subject to prior license, and all export proceeds, as well as export prefinancing loans, must be surrendered to the Central Reserve Bank within 30 working days of expected date of receipt. Traditional 4Companies exporting at least 80 percent of their production to countries outside the Andean Pact and mining companies are exempt. 414 exports must be sold against an irrevocable letter of credit confirmed by a bank established in Peru. In special cases, and with the authorization of the Central Reserve Bank and the General Directorate of Foreign Trade, exports may be sold against sight drafts, provided that payment is received within 180 days of shipment. Exporters of most nontraditional products are granted transferable tax credit certificates (certificados de rein- tegro tributario^ or CERTEX) equivalent to a maximum of 30 percent of the f .o .b. value. In addition, 10 percent is allowed for exports from outside the Lima-Callao area. Exports of local handicrafts recognized as such by the General Directorate of Foreign Trade are eligible for CERTEX benefits at a rate of 35 percent. Exporters may be eligible for additional benefits at a rate of 10 percent in certain cases. CERTEX certificates may be used by the exporter in payment of his tax obligations or may be sold to other taxpayers, who may use them for the same purpose. The Export Credit Insurance Company of Peru (SECREX) administers an export credit guarantee pro- gram, and the Central Reserve Bank (since December 1983) provides or arranges export finance for nontradi- tional exports. To be eligible for the incentives granted for nontraditional exports, exporters must be listed in the Register of Enterprises Exporting Nontraditional Prod- ucts; each entry in the list is valid for two years. Most traditional exports are subject to a tax of 5 or 10 percent, which is payable in soles, but when the international price is below a specified level, exports of copper, lead, zinc, silver, gold, tin, and tungsten are exempt. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles may be held abroad or sold to the banking system w i th in ten working days of receipt. Capital Outward capital transfers require approval. For trans- fers derived from foreign direct investment the approval of CONITE is required; for most other transfers the appropriate agency is the Central Reserve Bank. Mini- mum maturities and grace periods for different cate- gories of external loans contracted or guaranteed by the public sector have been established. Furthermore, annual global limits are established on the contracting of new public or publicly guaranteed external debt (with certain exceptions) having an original maturity of more than one but less than ten years. Loan amortization payments of the private sector are authorized by the Central Reserve Bank and those of the public sector by the General Directorate of Public Credit. Short-term trade credits with banks that have not signed a ref inanc ing agreement are to be rolled over on maturity un t il signature of agreement. Local currency funds for the servicing of these debts are to be placed on deposit in special accounts at the Central Reserve Bank on the maturity date of the original obligation. With the permission of the Central Bank, funds in these special ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution accounts may be lent out domestically as loans denomi- nated in foreign currency, with a maturity of less than one year. Service payments on public sector short-term debt to national or foreign banks are authorized only if matched by a loan from such creditors to Banco de la Nacion or COFIDE for an amount at least as large as the repayment, and conforming with specified conditions. In compliance with the foreign investment regime approved by the countries of the Andean Pact, new foreign investments must be authorized and registered with the appropriate agency, in most instances, CONITE, so that such investments are directed to projects consid- ered essential for the country's development. If a foreign company incorporated in Peru as of July 1, 1971 wishes to benefit from the duty-free program of the Cartagena Agreement, it was required to have agreed by June 30, 1974 to the gradual acquisition by national investors of shares in the company, so as to transform it into a mixed or national company during a maximum period of 15 years following the entering into effect of this regime. For this purpose, mixed companies are defined as those in which national investors hold between 51 percent and 80 percent of the capital, and national companies are those in which at least 80 percent of the capital is owned by national investors. Since June 30, 1974 the required participation of national investors in the capital of an enterprise has been not less than 15 percent; this participation must be raised to at least 45 percent after 10 years and to at least 51 percent at the end of the 15-year period. For foreign companies established in Peru after June 30, 1971, the 15 percent participation by national investors must be secured at the time of the initiation of production. Foreign investments in firms engaged in basic industries or in mining activities (including petroleum production) and in firms that export at least 80 percent of their production to countries outside the Andean Common Market are exempt from the requirement of gradual transformation into mixed companies; however, these enterprises do not benefit from the duty-free program of the Cartagena Agreement. Foreign enterprises may have access to short-term domestic credit in amounts not greater than their capital and reserves. Investment in the mining sector is governed by the General Mining Law. Companies holding mining con- cessions may enter into mining contracts with the Government providing for special incentives and guaran- tees or may constitute mixed enterprises with govern- ment participation of at least 25 percent. The Govern- ment may grant to mining concessionaries (initiating large-scale investment programs) tax incentives and guaranteed availability of foreign exchange for transfers for (1) recovery of investment; (2) interest payments if the rate does not exceed the prevailing rate for similar loans in the financial market from which the loans originate; (3) payments for justified services; and (4) reasonable profit remittances, together with guaran- teed access to the most favorable exchange rate. Mixed mining enterprises may receive all the benefits and PERU incentives which may be granted by special contract and, in addition, special tax reductions. Gold Export of gold in the form of precious metals is the monopoly of the Banco Minero del Peru. The authorities do not make foreign exchange available for imports of gold other than by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and authorized industrial and professional users. Domestic sales and purchases of gold may be carried out by industrial and professional users, provided that they hold licenses issued by the Banco Minero del Peru, but only MINPECO is authorized to make the initial purchase of newly mined gold and other precious metals. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement February 1. In replacement of the sol, a new monetary unit (the "inti") was introduced, consisting of 100 "cen- timos," and equivalent to 1,000 soles ( i .e ., I/. 1 = S/. 1,000). In this context, it was announced that the financial system could continue to denominate transac- tions in soles until December 31, 1985, but that from January 1, 1986, any reference to the national currency of Peru should be made exclusively in intis. August 2. The convertibility into foreign currency of all U.S. dollar-denominated certificates of deposit with Peruvian banks was suspended for a period of 90 days. During the suspension period, holders of U .S. dollar- denominated certificates of deposit could: (a) convert them into soles at an exchange rate equivalent to that prevailing in the official market (selling) plus a premium of 3 percent; (b) use them to make any payments abroad authorized to be made through the official market; or (c) use them at their maturity to open new U .S. dollar- denominated certificates of deposit (CD). Trading of these certificates between private parties was not re- stricted, nor was the suspension of convertibility applica- ble to diplomatic missions, international organizations, or their staffs. In addition, the exchange rate in the midpoint official market was fixed at S/. 13,942.77 per U.S. dollar, and the system of frequent adjustments in the official rate was discontinued. At the same time, a free exchange market was introduced to replace the market for U.S. dollar-denominated CD market, the latter having been abolished with the freezing of CDs. The free exchange market would handle all transactions not eligible for foreign exchange in the official market, essentially private capital transactions and current invis- ible payments. August 9. The Central Reserve Bank of Peru an- nounced that it would buy, at the rate of S/. 17,500 per U.S. dollar, foreign exchange acquired by financial institutions in the free exchange market. August 16. The Central Reserve Bank of Peru an- nounced that the selling exchange rate for the sol in the free exchange market could be modified from time to time on the basis of developments in the economic situation. 415 ©International Monetary Fund.

Not for Redistribution PHILIPPINES (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Philippines is the Philippine Peso. The authorities of the Philippines do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions, and ex- change rates are determined on the basis of demand and supply in the exchange market. However, the authorities intervene when necessary in order to maintain orderly conditions in the exchange market and in light of their other policy objectives in the medium term. On Decem- ber 31, 1985 the official rate was ¥ 19.032 per US$1. The spot buying and selling margins are determined on a competitive basis for all transactions under the general jurisdiction of the Bankers' Association of the Philip- pines. The Central Bank is not governed by the trading rules of the Bankers' Association of the Philippines in making its own purchases and sales of foreign exchange. Interbank trading takes place on-floor at the Foreign Exchange Trading Center (FOREX) from 4:30 p.m. through 5:00 p.m. daily, and off-floor through telephone communications between banks during business hours. The Central Bank from time to time acts as a buyer or as a supplier on the trading floor. There is a 1 percent tax on all purchases and sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Exchange regulations are administered by the Central Bank on the basis of policy decisions reached by the Monetary Board. Certain new foreign direct or portfolio investments in the Philippines require the prior approval of the Board of Investments (BOI). In addition to other banks, the thrift banks and the rural banks are authorized by the Central Bank to deal in foreign exchange; subject to certain conditions, they may purchase foreign currencies from tourists and other specified nonresidents, for conversion into pesos. Prescription of Currency There are no prescription of currency requirements for outgoing payments, but all exchange proceeds from exports and invisibles must be obtained in prescribed currencies.1 Most payments and transfers to South Africa are prohibited. Authorized agent banks and foreign exchange dealers are authorized to accept notes denominated in Saudi Arabian riyals, Kuwaiti dinars, and Bahrain dinars for conversion into pesos. Nonresident Accounts Bank accounts denominated in pesos may be opened in the names of nonresidents, whether individual or corporate, without the prior approval of the Central Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, deutsche mark, French francs, Hong Kong dollars, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Singapore dollars, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. Bank. Nonresident accounts may be credited only with the proceeds from inward remittances of foreign ex- change or convertible foreign currencies and with peso income from, or peso proceeds of, conversion of properties (real or personal) located in the Philippines and belonging to nonresidents. Nonresident accounts may be freely debited for peso withdrawals. Withdraw- als from nonresident accounts for transfer abroad are subject to individual application with supporting evi- dence and to established limits where applicable, such as in the case of emigrants. Subject to authorization, both residents and nonresi- dents may maintain foreign currency accounts with authorized agent banks in the Philippines (see section on Proceeds from Invisibles, below). Imports and Import Payments Imports from South Africa are prohibited. All mer- chandise imports are allowed, except for certain com- modities that are regulated or restricted for reasons, inter alia, of public health, national security, international agreements, or local industry protection. Imports are at present classified into freely importable commodities, prohibited, banned, regulated, or liberalized commodities. The first group comprises commodities that are freely importable and that may be given due course by authorized agent banks (AABs) without prior approval of the Central Bank. Prohibited commodities are commodities whose importation is prohibited, such as those originating from South Africa, onions, potatoes, garlic, cabbages (except for seedling purposes), and coffee. The third category—banned commodities—consists of those for which importation requires prior Central Bank approval. These are further classified into nonessential consumer (NEC) and unclassified consumer (UC) goods. Regulated commod- ity imports are defined as commodities that require clearances and permits from various government agen- cies but do not need prior Central Bank approval before importation. Finally, liberalized commodities are com- modities that were formerly banned but may now be imported without prior Central Bank approval. Sales of foreign exchange for imports of commodities that are classified under the two categories of consumer goods— UC and NEC—are subject to prior approval of the Central Bank, and the opening of letters of credit for such imports must be reported to the Central Bank within 24 hours. Payments for imports of certain other com- modities (wheat, raw cotton, and leaf tobacco) are permitted only if they are financed through certain official credit arrangements. Imports of a consignment basis require prior Central Bank approval. Any importa- tion of plant, machinery, equipment, and spare parts under deferred payments arrangements with maturity periods longer than 360 days is subject to prior approval 417 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PHILIPPINES by the Central Bank. If payment terms are cash or within 360 days, prior approval by the Central Bank is necessary for importation by any single importer of nonagricultural machinery and equipment with an aggre- gate value in excess of US$50,000 within a calendar month, with the exception of (a) imports of specified machinery and implements; and (b) plant machinery and equipment for the exchange and direct use of (i) export- oriented firms that qualify as such under Central Bank regulations; (ii) registered activities of BOI-registered firms; and (iii) companies registered with the Export Processing Zone Authority (EPZA), subject in all cases to the presentation of required certifications from the relevant government agencies concerned. Prior approval for imports of machinery and capital equipment by the Board of Investment is required for certain local content and "progressive" manufacturing programs. Trade with any of the state-trading countries, exclud- ing Yugoslavia, must be effected through the Philippine International Trading Corporation. As a method of payment, commodities may be imported against letters of credit, on a document against acceptance (D/A) basis, or under open account (O/A) arrangements. The use of the D/A and O/A procedures is restricted to oil firms, export-oriented companies certified or registered by the Central Bank, the Board of Investment, the Garments and Textile Export Board, or the EPZA, exporters of semiconductor devices, export- ers of garments and footwear, paper mills and paper manufacturers, and franchised public utility concerns. The use of these procedures by producer firms normally is restricted to commodities in the Essential Producer Goods category. Unless arrangements are made for such terms of credit, imports in excess of US$1,000 must be covered by letters of credit opened on or before the day of shipment and are subject to the release certificate requirement. Imports financed by the importer's own foreign exchange or not involving payments from the Philippines (i.e., "no dollar" imports) are allowed, subject to prescribed conditions, and are exempt from the requirement of opening letters of credit. The reserve requirement on marginal deposit on all import letters of credit is 100 percent. At the request of an authorized agent bank or other financial institution, a firm may be "watch listed" by the Central Bank for arrears on its loan repayment commit- ments. A firm thus watch listed may not open import letters of credit without the approval of the Central Bank, which will allow the opening of letters of credit only after a schedule for the repayment of overdue obligations has been agreed upon. Certain authorized agent banks require 50 percent deposit against the opening of letters of credit for such firms, compared with 25 percent in normal cases. There are separate regulations for imports into border regions by baiter traders. Payments for Invisibles Virtually all payments to South Africa are prohibited. In principle, all other payments are permitted, with prior 418 approval of the Central Bank, provided that amounts of more than US$100 are substantiated by documentary evidence. However, there are certain limits established by the Central Bank for purchases of foreign exchange for travel abroad by residents, remittances for educa- tional expenses, maintenance and expenses of depen- dents of residents while abroad, remittances of profits, dividends, and interest, royalties, and for film and other rentals (see below). Foreign exchange allowance for travel abroad is limited to the following amounts: (a) for both business and nonbusiness travel, irrespective of duration, up to a maximum of US$3,000 for the United States, Canada, South America, Europe, Australia, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and New Zealand (Area I); (b) for both business and nonbusiness travel, irrespective of duration, up to a maximum of US$1,000 for Hong Kong, Taiwant, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and other countries not included in the coverage of the area under (a) (Area II); (c) for travelers under 21 years of age, up to a maximum of US$500, irrespective of duration and destination; and (d) for overseas contract workers with prearranged employment, up to a maximum of US$100. Applications for travel abroad for a fifth or subsequent time within one calendar year are subject to careful review by the agent banks to prevent abuse. A foreign tourist holding a visa valid for up to 59 days may remit abroad up to the equivalent of US$1,000 against payment in another foreign currency brought in by the tourist; beyond this amount, approval must be obtained from the Central Bank. The following limits apply to exchange for educa- tional expenses abroad for students undertaking bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree courses at duly accredited colleges or universities. The allowances are divided according to the areas in which the study is undertaken: living allowances are provided up to US$500 per month in Area I and US$350 per month in Area II; books and supplies allowances up to US$500 per year in both areas; clothing allowance up to US$500 per year in Area I and US$300 per year in Area II; other miscellaneous school expenses are allowed up to US$500 per year in Area I and US$300 per year in Area II. Any scholarship allowances are deducted from these amounts. High school students may be granted foreign exchange for education only under an exchange program and under the following conditions: the max- imum travel funds per student will be US$500, the maximum clothing allowance and incidental expenses during his stay abroad will be US$500, or US$1,000 a student a calendar year. The limits on remittances to dependents of residents are as follows: US$250 a month for each dependent living in Area I as defined above, and US$150 a month for each dependent living in Area II. The maintenance allowances for dependents are granted only for close relatives under conditions prescribed by the Central Bank. tSee Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part Two, page 75. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Remittances of profits and dividends (net of taxes) accruing to nonresidents out of net profits realized after October 14, 1984 are permitted in fu l l, provided that remittances are not financed from domestic borrowings. Remittances of royalties or rentals on patents, trademarks, and copyrights accruing after October 14, 1984 are freely permitted (net of taxes) for contracts registered with the Central Bank or the Technology Transfer Board, provided that the royalties do not exceed 5 percent of the wholesale price of the commodity that is manufactured locally under the royalty contract (2 per- cent in the case of marketing service contracts), and that contracts do not exceed five-year terms and do not include restrictions on the export of the product. Remit- tances of the producer's share of earnings made on motion-picture films and rentals on television films are freely permitted, provided generally that the shares or rentals do not exceed 60 percent of net proceeds from films. Notwithstanding other provisions, however, all unserviced eligible nontrade, nonloan remittances (e .g ., dividends, profits, royalties, lease payments, fees, com- missions, etc.) earned and which became due and payable before October 15, 1984 and in arrears of transfers as of that date shall not be serviced without prior Central Bank approval. Foreign exchange w i th in the l im i ts established above may be purchased from authorized agent banks, with the prior approval of the Central Bank. Applications for payments for certain invisibles for wh ich no basic allowance has been set are considered on their merits by the Central Bank. No person may take out or export from the Philippines foreign currency or any other foreign exchange except as authorized by the Central Bank. Residents may take out, as part of their travel allowance, up to US$1,000 in foreign bank notes. Nonresident travelers may take out any amount of foreign currency that they had previously brought in and declared, less any amounts converted into pesos. Resident and nonresident travelers require prior authorization from the Central Bank to take out more than P 500 in domestic notes and coin or checks, money orders, and other bills of exchange drawn in pesos. When traveling abroad, citizens of the Philippines must pay a travel tax of P 2,700 for first-class passengers and P 1,620 for economy-class passengers. Reduced rates of P 1,350 for first-class passengers and P 810 for econ- omy-class passengers are provided for groups of people traveling for recognized special purposes. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. Exports of certain strategic materials and items deemed essential for industrialization and economic development are also prohibited. Otherwise, exports are generally not re- stricted but are regulated to ensure that the foreign exchange proceeds are surrendered to an authorized agent of the Central Bank. Authorized agent banks issue the necessary export permits upon registration of the exporter's report of foreign sales (except export permits PHILIPPINES for gold, wh ich are issued by the Central Bank); reports of foreign sales of copra, coconut oil, and sugar-based commodities, however, are approved for registration only by the Central Bank. Registration of sales of sugar- based commodities requires prior clearance by the Department of Trade. As a general rule, no commodity may be exported unless it is covered by a draft drawn in one of the prescribed currencies (see footnote 1) and unless collec- tion of the proceeds w i ll be undertaken by an authorized agent bank; however, payment by means of telegraphic transfer, check, or mail transfer may be allowed. Payments for exports on a cash, collection, or consign- ment basis must be arranged through an authorized agent bank, which must specifically contract w i th the exporter to buy the exchange proceeds. No shipment of exports will be allowed by the customs unless a certificate is issued by a bank stating that payment has been received or arranged. Export proceeds must be received in a prescribed currency w i th in 60 days from the date of shipment (or w i th in such period as may be established in special cases) and surrendered to the agent bank within three business days of receipt. The und rawn balances of exports involving initial drawings of less than 100 per- cent of the f .o .b. invoice value must be collected and repatriated w i th in 150 days from the date of shipment for exports to Europe, Afr ica, and Latin America, and 120 days from date of shipment for exports to other countries. An irrevocable letter of credit is required for all exports of scrap metals, copra, and coconut oil, and for all exports to Guam, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and Japan. Exports of perishable commodities to Hong Kong require prepayment. An export tax is levied on the f .o .b. value of certain major exports. The rate is 6 percent for centrifugal sugar; 4 percent for gold, s i lver, iron ore and concentrates, chromite ore and concentrates, unmanufac tured abaca, molasses, canned pineapples, bunker fuel oil, cement clinker, portland cement, petroleum pitch and residues, and lumber and veneer; and 2 percent for bananas. However, the export taxes on sugar, mineral products, molasses, cement, petroleum pitch and residue, as well as bunker fue l, are suspended. The Philippine Sugar Marketing Agency (PHILSUMA) has a monopoly over the export of sugar. Export trade with state-trading countries, excluding Yugoslavia, is handled through the Philippine Interna- tional Trading Corporation. There are separate regula- tions for exports from border regions by barter traders. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles must be sold w i th in three business days to an authorized agent bank. Whenever the net foreign exchange receipts from invisibles amount to at least US$100,000 (or its equivalent in other curren- cies) for the calendar year immediately preceding, the firm may, upon application, be certified by the Central Bank as export-oriented and shall be entitled to retain a portion of its earnings in a special foreign currency 419 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PHILIPPINES deposit account with AABs for operating expenses abroad and other contingencies, equivalent to the aver- age expenses incurred during the preceding 3 months plus 10 percent of the gross foreign exchange receipts during the immediately preceding 12 months. Philippine nationals employed abroad are permitted to open U .S. dollar deposit accounts with authorized agent banks, in which they may retain any U .S. dollars they remit to the Philippines. To be eligible for credit to such accounts, earnings must be transferred through Philip- pine diplomatic establishments. Under a foreign cur- rency deposit scheme, inward remittances of foreign currencies by residents or nonresidents for deposit in numbered foreign currency accounts are allowed, provided that the remittances represent neither current earnings or income of residents nor payments by nonresi- dents pursuant to contractual obligations. Balances in such accounts are freely transferable abroad. Philippine nationals working abroad are required to repatriate specified minimum shares of their foreign earnings, ranging from 50 percent to 80 percent. Travelers may freely bring in any amount of foreign currency and up to P 500 in domestic notes and coin and checks, money orders, and other bills of exchange drawn in pesos, of which not more than P 50 may consist of Philippine coin. Peso-denominated gold coins issued by the Central Bank of the Philippines are exempt from these requirements. Capital Virtually all payments and transfers to South Africa are prohibited. Remittances of foreign exchange for repayment of principal on all foreign obligations of whatever maturity due to foreign banks or other financial institutions during the period October 17, 1983 to January 16, 1985 are subject to prior approval by the Central Bank. All inward and outward capital move- ments, with the exception of certain banking operations and certain transactions related to financing of interna- tional trade (see below), are subject to the prior and specific approval of the Central Bank. When applications for new inward foreign investments (in kind or in cash), as well as new foreign borrowings are reviewed, prefer- ence is given to projects approved by the BOI, to export- oriented industries, and to other (nonexport-oriented) industries not utilizing domestic credit resources. The law guarantees fu ll repatriation of cash investments made after March 15, 1973 in export-oriented industries that have been certified by the Central Bank, in enter- prises registered with the BOI, and in securities certified by the Central Bank and traded on the Manila and Makati Stock Exchanges. As a m in imum, foreign investors must hold securities for at least 90 days before the proceeds become eligible for repatriation. Foreign companies are eligible to borrow pesos from domestic sources, provided they have a debt-equity ratio of 60:40 in high-priority sectors, 55:45 in medium- priority sectors, and 50:50 in low-priority sectors. 420 Foreign direct cash investments made after March 15, 1973 and registered w i th the Central Bank are freely repatriable, except for investments in domestic commer- cial banks, wh ich, if made after March 31, 1973, are freely repatriable and if made before that date are repatriable according to the schedule specified under (4) in this paragraph (below). There are restrictions on sales of foreign exchange for the repatriation of foreign direct cash investments made before March 16, 1973 and noncash investments made after March 15, 1973, de- pending on the category of industry where the invest- ment is made, as follows: (1) investments in export- oriented industries certified by the Central Bank are repatriable in fu l l, but no annual installment may exceed the applicant's share in the net foreign exchange earnings of the firm in the preceding year; (2) investments in enterprises registered w i th the BOI, producing import substitutes or exports, are repatriable in three equal annual installments starting one year after the liquidation of the investment, but no annual installment may exceed the total net foreign exchange earnings in the preceding year; (3) investments in enterprises registered w i th the BOI (not included in (2) above and not u t i l iz ing domestic credit resources) are repatriable in three equal annual installments starting one year after the liquidation of the investment; and (4) for investments in the remaining industries, repatriation is allowed according to the following schedule: for amounts of US$0.25 million or less, five equal annual installments after liquidation; for amounts w i th in the range US$0.25-0.5 million, seven equal annual installments after liquidation; and for amounts of over US$0.5 m i l l ion, nine equal annual installments after l iqu ida t ion. Approval and registration by the Central Bank are required for the assigned capital of branches of foreign banks to be eligible for profit remittances and capital repatriation. During the period between the date of the investment and repatriation, liquidation proceeds may be reinvested, subject to approval by the Central Bank, in foreign currency deposits, in government securities, or in shares of stock in export-oriented industries registered w i th the BOI or certified by the Central Bank. During the period between the sale of securities approved by the Central Bank and the actual repatriation of cash sales, the proceeds may, while awaiting the scheduled repatriation, be placed by the foreign investor in any of the following financial instruments: (a) government securities; (b) shares of stock in BOI-registered industries; and (c) shares of stock in export-oriented industries certified by the Cen- tral Bank. Without prior central bank approval, commercial banks may not receive credit from abroad other than credit arising from normal international trade transac- tions. They may, however, accept deposits in nine scheduled currencies2 from nonresidents of foreign 2Canad ian do l lars, deutsche ma rk, French f ranc s, I ta l ian lire, Japanese y en, Ne the r lands gu i lde rs, pounds s te r l ing, Swiss francs, and U .S. dollars. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution nationality; such deposits are freely repatriable at the prevailing exchange rate and are exempt from the 35 percent withholding tax. Twenty-five domestic com- mercial banks and four local branches of foreign banks are licensed to operate in an expanded foreign currency deposit scheme; these foreign currency deposit un it banks (FCDUs) are empowered to borrow funds from international money markets for domestic on-lending. Nonbank residents may obtain suppliers' credits from abroad, provided that repayment terms are within the limits prescribed by the Central Bank. Maturities of long-term loans or repayment terms should be as follows: (1) US$250,000 or less, three years; (2) over US$250,000 up to US$500,000, five years; (3) over US$500,000 up to US$3 million, seven years; and (4) over US$3 million, eight to ten years. Firms whose products are clearly destined for export, as well as firms earning foreign exchange and du ly certified as belonging to other priority areas (food, energy, infrastructure, transport, and communication) with appropriate govern- ment agencies, may secure credits in excess of US$3 million w i th a m in imum repayment period of seven to eight years. Interest rates may not be more than 1.5 percent above the prime rate of the lending country. Applications are not approved if the proposed project expands capacity in an industry deemed to be over- crowded or for firms that are in arrears w i th government financial institutions. Any prospective borrowing equiv- alent to US$3 million or more must be submitted for inclusion in the Central Bank's programming of external credit resources. Sales of foreign exchange for amortiza- tion of loans are permitted in accordance with the terms of loan contracts approved by the Central Bank. The same applies for loan contracts registered w i th the Central Bank prior to November 26, 1969. For those not falling under these two categories, prior approval by the Central Bank is required for sales of foreign exchange for repayment of loans. Emigrants may transfer up to US$5,000, subject to verification by the Central Bank. The remaining liquid assets may be withdrawn in five years beginning one year from emigration. Outward investment by resident persons, firms, or corporations requires prior approval of the Central Bank through the Management of External Debt and Invest- ment Accounts Department. Except as otherwise specifically authorized, resident persons, firms, or cor- porations may not enter into any contract or transaction that may involve settlement in foreign exchange, or involving any assets belonging to them expressed in foreign currencies or payable or deliverable abroad. This restriction also applies to contracts or transactions involving assets w i th in the Philippines belonging to a nonresident person, firm, or corporation, and to their export or import. Detailed regulations are in force concerning transactions in securities between residents and nonresidents. Twenty-five foreign banks have been authorized to operate offshore banking un i ts^n the Philippines. These PHILIPPINES units may engage in a wide range of foreign currency transactions w i th nonresidents and w i th other offshore un i ts. Offshore banking un i ts may open and maintain deposit accounts in pesos w i th domestic agent banks exclusively to meet administrative and other operating expenses and to pay to designated local beneficiaries of nonresident Filipinos the equivalent of foreign exchange remittances channeled through the offshore bank ing units' correspondent banks abroad. Offshore banking un i ts may also sell inward remittances of foreign exchange to the Central Bank. All investors in enterprises registered w i th the BOI are guaranteed the right to repatriate their investments and to remit earnings thereon as well as sums needed to meet payments of principal and interest on foreign loans; they are also guaranteed freedom from expropriation and requisition. There are d ifferent arrangements for "pioneer investments" and "preferred investments"; the former are granted certain incentives over and above those given to preferred investments. Normally, enterprises owned or controlled by foreign nationals are permitted to operate only in "pioneer areas of investment," and at least 60 percent of the outstanding voting capital stock of registered enterprises in "pre- ferred areas of investment" must be owned by Philippine nationals. Under the Foreign Investment Law of 1968, new enterprises where investment by non-Filipinos exceeds 30 percent and wh ich are not covered by the Investment Incentives Act of 1967 must obtain prior authority from the BOI in order to engage in any economic activity in the Philippines. If purchases of shares of common stock by foreign nationals would reduce Philippine ownership in a firm to less than 70 percent, permission from the BOI must first be obtained. Gold Producers of gold may be eligible for assistance under the Gold Industry Assistance Act, irrespective of whether the gold is a by-product or the principal or only product of their operations. Beginning in August 1985, repayment of certain foreign debts of the Philippine private corporate sector is guided by a Central Bank program administered by a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank. The Central Bank purchases the entire output of the 14 domestic primary gold producers.

Not for Redistribution PORTUGAL (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Portugal is the Portuguese Escudo, the exchange rate of which is adjusted at relatively short intervals in relation to a basket of currencies, weighted according to their importance in Portugal's international merchandise trade. Periodically, the Bank of Portugal announces depreciation objectives for the effective ex- change rate of the escudo: the monthly rate of deprecia- tion, which was initially set in May 1978 at 1.25 percent but was lowered progressively to 0.50 percent by June 1980, was raised to 1 percent in March 1983, and was temporarily halted at the end of November 1985. On December 31, 1985 the authorized banks' buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were Esc 157.271 and Esc 157.703, respectively, per US$1. Rates for other currencies1 are quoted by the Bank of Portugal on the basis of U.S. dollar rates in exchange markets abroad. There is a tax of 0.6 percent on all sales of foreign exchange. The Macao pataca is pegged to the Hong Kong dollar at a parity rate of P 1.03 = HK$1. Authorized banks may deal in foreign exchange with the Bank of Portugal and among themselves. They are also normally allowed to deal in foreign exchange with banks abroad at the rates prevailing in the Portuguese foreign exchange market. They are not allowed to enter into arbitrage operations in foreign markets. In dealing with their customers, the authorized banks buy and sell foreign exchange in convertible currencies for their own account. Purchases and sales of unquoted currencies can be made only through an authorized bank acting on a commission basis. Banks are required to obtain the prior approval of the Bank of Portugal to accept deposits in foreign currencies from residents or nonresidents and to obtain short-term credits abroad. The banks may use their foreign exchange holdings for all authorized pur- poses, but the Ministry of Finance may set limits on the use of these resources and, in certain circumstances, may require that foreign exchange assets be sold to the Bank of Portugal. The net foreign asset positions of the authorized banks and their gross foreign exchange holdings are subject to ceilings. Administration of Control Exchange controls are administered by the Bank of Portugal on behalf of the Ministry of Finance, with the assistance of the commercial banks authorized for this purpose. Foreign trade policy is formulated and implemented by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce; almost all foreign trade transactions are subject to prior registration 'Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, the ECUs, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Greek drachmas, Italian lire, Irish pounds, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, South African rand, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. 426 with the Ministry. The Director-General of Foreign Commerce in this Ministry is responsible for administer- ing trade controls. Import and export bulletins are issued by a department within the Directorate General of Foreign Commerce or by other authorized executive departments. State agencies undertaking international trade transactions are required to use Portuguese vessels. Prescription of Currency Transactions with Turkey are settled on a monthly basis through a clearing account maintained in U .S. dol- lars. Export transactions with other countries may be settled in the quoted currencies (see footnote 1) or in U .S. dollars. Payments to nonresidents may be made by crediting escudos to a nonresident account, the opening of which is subject to prior approval by the Bank of Portugal. Nonresident Accounts Foreign Accounts in Escudos are divided into (1) Time Foreign Accounts in Escudos, for which the opening, debiting, and crediting are subject to special advance authorization of the Bank of Portugal; and (2) Demand Foreign Accounts in Escudos, which may be opened by bodies other than credit institutions, are subject to special authorization of the Bank of Portugal, but may be debited and credited without prior authoriza- tion of the Bank of Portugal for payments for transac- tions authorized in escudos concerning imports and exports of goods, services, and capital between Portugal and foreign countries and for transfers between such accounts. For all other debit and credit operations, authorization of the Bank of Portugal is required. The granting of credit in the form of overdrafts on the accounts described above requires the authorization of the Bank of Portugal. Foreign Accounts in Escudos in the names of persons resident or domiciled in Turkey, w i th which Portugal has a special clearing arrangement, are opened, debited, and credited according to instructions issued by the Bank of Portugal. Special accounts in escudos have been established to which must be credited those Portuguese bank notes that have been presented by foreign correspondents and are in excess of the amounts that may be credited to Demand Foreign Accounts in Escudos. These accounts may be debited only for payments in escudos to residents, subject to the prior authorization of the Bank of Portugal. Deposit accounts in escudos may be opened by Portuguese emigrants. Such accounts may be in the form of current accounts, accounts requiring advance notice of withdrawal, or time accounts. Without prior authoriza- tion from the Bank of Portugal, deposit accounts may be credited only with remittances from abroad received through the banking system or in the form of an ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution international postal order, the equivalent in escudos of external means of payment sold to credit institutions by emigrants, and interest due on such deposits. Deposit accounts may be debited without restrictions. Nonresidents may open time foreign accounts in nine foreign currencies. Such accounts may be credited with remittances from abroad and with the related interest due and may be debited without restrictions. However, a nonresident wishing to use the funds on these accounts in Portugal is subject to the exchange regulations currently in force. There are also provisions for resident accounts in foreign currencies. Imports and Import Payments Imports of certain products are prohibited or are allowed only under specific conditions, mainly for reasons of health, public order, and the prevention of commercial fraud. Any physical or juridical entity may be an importer; importers must have an import entitle- ment and must pay income taxes regularly. Prior registration (in the form of a "bulletin") is required for all imports valued at over Esc 15,000. Most imports from all sources are effected on the basis of bulletins. For imports free of quantitative restriction, the bulletin enables the importer to obtain the necessary foreign exchange. For imports subject to restriction, the bulletin is equivalent to an import license. The validity of the bulletin is 3 months for customs clearance purposes and 12 months from the date of customs clearance for settlement purposes; in special cases, longer validity periods may be granted. Personal bag- gage and imports of merchandise, the value of which does not exceed Esc 15,000, do not require a bulletin, except when forming part of an order with a total value exceeding Esc 15,000 and provided they are not ex- pressly excluded from this exemption. Imports of books up to Esc 30,000 and of newspapers and technical, scientific, or cultural periodicals up to Esc 200,000 are also exempt from the bulletins. Payments beyond one year after customs clearance require the approval of the Bank of Portugal. Imports of certain items, such as unassembled auto- mobiles, household appliances, and f ru i ts, are subject temporarily to quota limitations in value terms. Goods not on the negative list may be imported freely from most countries that are members of the GATT. The negative list includes certain foodstuffs and other ag- ricultural products, certain natural or manufactured raw materials, some textile fibers, and a small number of finished products, including motor vehicles; the items on the list are subject to quantitative restrictions for protec- tive reasons or are under special regimes. A somewhat more extensive negative list applies to Japan. The GATT liberalization does not apply to Ghana and Nigeria; imports from these GATT members of goods that would be liberalized if imported from other GATT countries are subject to individual authorization, which is granted on the merits of the case. Nonliberalized imports from PORTUGAL countries that are GATT members are admitted under individual authorization. All imports from countries that are not members of the GATT are based on individual authorizations; imports from some Eastern European countries are generally licensed in accordance with bilateral trading arrangements. There are a few bilateral quotas for specified agricul- tural imports from certain EFT A countries. Imports of nonliberalized industrial products, except for certain protected steel products and automobiles, are free of quantitative restriction when originating in EFTA or EC countries. Special legislation provides that automobiles assembled in Portugal are subject to the use of certain m in imum percentages of domestic components. How- ever, imports of passenger automobiles of non-EFTA and non-EC origin are allowed up to 15 units a producer a year for those makes not assembled in Portugal and, for other makes, up to 2 percent of the number of vehicles of the same make that were assembled in Portugal in the preceding year. Imports of some makes of EFTA and EC origin were allowed up to 600 units for each producer in 1985. Imports of certain vehicles for special purposes are free of restrictions. Domestic credit financing is restricted for certain imports and foreign financing is required for certain imports. M in imum proportions of foreign financing and m in imum repayment terms are prescribed by the Bank of Portugal. Many imports are subject to a temporary import surcharge of 10 percent of the customs value, irrespective of origin. Imports of a few nonessential goods are also subject to a temporary import surcharge of 60 percent of the customs value. Payments for Invisibles Payments to foreign countries for current invisibles must be made through authorized banks and are gener- ally free of quantitative restrictions, but for most transactions ceilings are specified for the amounts of foreign exchange that authorized banks may grant freely. For payments to countries with which Portugal does not maintain special clearing arrangements, the autho- rized banks may grant foreign exchange up to the equivalent of Esc 200,000 a transaction for most types of invisibles, and the licensing centers (established in continental Portugal and the Azores) of those banks may grant up to the equivalent of Esc 5 million. For tourism and other private travel they may grant to persons 18 years of age or over the equivalent of Esc 100,000 a person a year, Esc 70,000 for persons between 12 and 18, and Esc 40,000 for children under 12; in addition, tourists may take out of the country Esc 5,000 in local currency for each trip. The export of larger amounts of domestic or foreign currency requires the prior authori- zation of the Bank of Portugal. Application must be made to the Bank of Portugal for exchange for payments of items not referred to above and for payments in excess of the above-mentioned limits. Under the provisions of the Foreign Investment Code, individual remittances of profits and dividends may be 427 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PORTUGAL subject to phasing for a period of up to one year, depen- ding on the prevailing balance of payments situation. Phased amounts awaiting remittance may be deposited with domestic banks in accounts denominated in foreign exchange. Special provisions apply to situations of serious external imbalance or when the amount involved is so large as to be deemed to entail serious economic and financial disturbance to the country; in such cases, individual remittances of profits and dividends may be suspended for a period of time to be determined by the Council of Ministers, but annual remittance of at least 20 percent of the amount involved shall always be authorized. By the end of 1984, these special provisions were, however, not in force. Exports and Export Proceeds Prior registration is required for all exports valued at over Esc 15,000. Exports are effected on the basis of "bulletins" (similar to the import bulletins). Export bulletins are issued freely; the primary purpose of this procedure is to enforce the prescription of currency and surrender regulations. The export of a few commodities is restricted, mainly to assure adequate supplies to domestic industries and to avoid depletion of local resources. Personal baggage and exports of merchan- dise, whose value does not exceed Esc 15,000, do not require a bulletin, provided they are not expressly excluded from this exemption. Re-exports of merchan- dise are exempt from prior registration, regardless of their value. Exporters are required to sell to an authorized bank the total amount of the export proceeds within the period and in the foreign currency stipulated in the export bulletin; the period for repatriation of export proceeds is, as a rule, fixed at four months from the date of customs clearance. Should settlement for exports occur later than four months after customs clearance, the exchange rate prevailing on the last day of the four-month period from the date of customs clearance would be applied. The Bank of Portugal may authorize the deduction of commission expenses abroad and freight, insurance, or other charges from the total amount subject to surrender. Proceeds from Invisibles Portuguese residents may receive freely payments in foreign currency for invisibles from residents of coun- tries with which Portugal does not have bilateral pay- ments arrangements. Such receipts may be effected through credit institutions and do not require prior authorization by the Bank of Portugal. Receipts from invisibles must be surrendered. Nonresident travelers may bring in freely up to Esc 5,000 in domestic bank notes and any amount in bank notes, coin, and checks denominated in foreign currency for their travel expenses; imports of notes and coin by nonresidents for other purposes require authori- zation by the Bank of Portugal, and the re-export by 428 nonresident travelers of foreign currency in excess of Esc 25,000 requires proof of prior importation of an equal or larger amount. Returning residents may bring in up to Esc 5,000 in domestic bank notes and any amount in foreign bank notes and coin. Authorized banks are not permitted to receive or to pay domestic or foreign bank notes or coin for settlement of external transactions. Capital All private capital transactions between Portugal and foreign countries are subject to prior authorization by the Bank of Portugal; for transactions exceeding Esc 800 million and with a maturity of more than one year, the approval of the Minister of Finance is also required. Foreign direct investments in Portugal are authorized on the basis of the Foreign Investment Code. Such investments are permitted in all sectors except those wh ich, under the general law, are closed to private enterprise corporations. An Exchange Risk Insurance Fund provides exchange risk insurance against losses caused by exchange rate movements in excess of 3 percent on approved foreign borrowing. When the transfer abroad of the proceeds from the liquidation of foreign investments involves large amounts, the Bank of Portugal may require that the transfer be phased over a period not exceeding five years. In such cases, exchange risk guarantees may be provided. Foreign loans and their repayments are autho- rized as necessary. Capital movements and transfers of assets are subject to ceilings (up to wh ich they are authorized auto- matically), according to Portugal's reservations to the OECD code of liberalization of capital movements. For larger amounts authorizations may be granted on the merits of each case. Direct transactions in foreign exchange between residents are prohibited. Gold Residents may hold gold in any form in Portugal. The purchase, sale, import, export, or re-export of bullion or coined and unworked gold, when carried out between Portugal and foreign countries, is subject to special advance authorization from the Bank of Portugal. There is a free market for gold in Macao, in which both residents of Macao and nonresidents who are not resident in Portugal may freely trade among themselves in bars, leaves, and coins. Imports and exports of gold, unless made by or on behalf of the Macao monetary authorities, require licenses issued by the Commissioner for Economy. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement July 15.

Not for Redistribution QATAR (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Qatar is the Qatar Riyal, which is pegged to the SDR at QR 4.7619 = SDR 1. Qatar has established margins of 7.25 percent around this rate. The Qatar Monetary Agency sets daily market rates for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, and the pound sterling. On December 31, 1985 the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were QR 3.6385 = US$1 and QR 3.6415 = US$1, respectively. The commercial banks' exchange rates for transac- tions in U .S. dollars are based on the Monetary Agen- cy's buying and selling rates. A spread of 0.87 dirham is applied to exchange transactions with the public. The commercial banks' buying and selling rates for other currencies are based on the Monetary Agency's rates for the U .S. dollar and market rates for the currency concerned against the U .S. dollar. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Qatar formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2 , 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, with effect from June 4, 1973. Administration of Control The Qatar Monetary Agency is the exchange control authority, but there is at present no exchange control legislation. Import licenses are issued by the Ministry of Economy and Commerce. Prescription of Currency All settlements with Israel and South Africa are prohibited. No other prescription of currency require- ments are in force. Nonresident Accounts No distinction is made between accounts held by residents and those held by nonresidents. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Israel and South Africa are pro- hibited. Also prohibited are imports of pork and its derivatives. Imports of alcoholic beverages, firearms, ammunition, and certain drugs are subject to licensing for reasons of health or public policy. Otherwise, imports are not restricted. There are no restrictions on payments for permitted imports. Imports of general goods are subject to a customs duty at the rate of 4.0 percent, which is the minimum rate applied by member countries of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Otherwise, all commodities may be exported freely. There are no requirements attached to receipts from exports or re-exports; the proceeds need not be repatri- ated or surrendered, and they may be disposed of freely, regardless of the currency involved. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments may not be made to or received from Israel and South Africa. Otherwise, there are no limitations on payments for and proceeds from invisibles. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or payments by residents or nonresidents, although payments may not be made to or received from Israel and South Africa. Foreign participation in certain industrial enterprises is prohibited unless Qatar nationals control at least 51 percent of the shares. Foreigners other than nationals of member states of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf are prohibited from business ownership in the trade sector. For major industrial projects, it is government policy to assume a m in imum of 70 percent ownership. Gold The monetary authorities and all other residents and nonresidents (including private persons) may freely and without license purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad. For trading purposes, the selling and buying of gold and precious metals are subject to import license and customs du ty. Transactions involving Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Changes During 1985 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 430 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ROMANIA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Romania is the Romanian Leu. The exchange rate used for all trade transactions in convert- ible currencies is the commercial rate, which is defined in terms of a basket of six currencies reflecting the geographical pattern of Romania's trade and payments. Weekly adjustments are made in the leu/U .S. dollar rate (and correspondingly in the rates for all other quoted currencies) in such a way as to maintain the central point on the basket peg. On December 31, 1985 the commer- cial exchange rate was lei 15.73 = US$1. The National Bank of Romania quotes rates for 16 other currencies defined as "fully convertible"1 and for the Finnish markka, the Greek drachma, the Indian rupee, the Israeli sheqel, the Portuguese escudo, the Spanish peseta, the Turkish lira, and the Yugoslav dinar, based on the rates for these currencies against the U .S. dollar in the countries concerned. For members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA),2 Albania, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the cur- rency used for commercial transactions is the transfer- able ruble (TR); on December 31, 1985 the transferable ruble rate was lei 15.50 per TR 1. For exchange rate purposes, payments for insurance and transportation connected with trade are considered as trade transactions. With the exception of payments and receipts for travel arranged through tourist organizations, which are considered commercial transactions, and of most capital transactions (excluding transfer of inher- itances), nontrade exchange transactions are carried out at the noncommercial exchange rate. Capital transactions are settled at the commercial rate. The noncommercial rate is pegged to the same basket of currencies as the commercial rate and is also adjusted on a weekly basis; the rate was lei 11.23 = US$1 on December 31, 1985. For the nontransport component of the expenses for individual travel to nonsocialist countries and Yugo- slavia and for certain other expenditures abroad, such as personal subscriptions to periodicals and legal penalties, a 100 percent tax is levied on purchases of foreign exchange. For nontrade transactions with the CMEA countries, Albania, and the Democratic People's Re- public of Korea, special exchange rates are established by multilateral or bilateral agreement; for transactions with the U .S .S .R ., this rate is lei 8.30 per rub 1. For persons working abroad in technical assistance jobs or as professionals, such as medical doctors, daily allowances are paid in foreign exchange, and any accumulated surpluses can be converted into lei at the noncommercial exchange rate. Romanians working in international organizations or joint ventures, as well as those occasionally receiving foreign exchange income, are required to repatriate a part of it as a contribution to the fund for training of staff involved in international cooperation and for the maintenance of their families at home. Administration of Control Foreign trade is a state monopoly. Import and export transactions are effected by foreign trade enterprises and other authorized units. Import and export transactions are subject to authorizations granted by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and International Economic Cooperation. In the issuing of authorizations, the provisions of existing trade agreements are taken into account. Foreign currency proceeds from exports are sold to the Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade; foreign currency required for import payments is purchased from that bank. Exchange control is administered by the Ministry of Finance, the National Bank, and the Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade. Prescription of Currency Payments to and from countries with which Romania has bilateral payments agreements are made in curren- cies and in accordance with the procedures set forth in those agreements.3 If no agreement exists, settlement is usually made in a convertible currency. Certain commer- cial settlements with Turkey are made in U .S. dollars under a credit agreement. Permitted foreign payments may not be made in lei. Nonresident Accounts Foreign juridical and physical persons may maintain accounts with the Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade, the National Bank, or with foreign banks having branch offices in Romania. These accounts are of three kinds: A-Accounts are maintained in convertible currency, or in lei obtained for convertible currencies, from the selling of precious metals, coins, or ingots, other than silver. B-Accounts are maintained in nonconvertible currencies quoted by the National Bank, in clearing currency, or in lei received from the conversion of such currencies. Transactions in any individual B-Account may be ef- fected in only one such currency. C-Accounts are maintained in lei received from other legal sources. 'Aus tra l ian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Irish pounds, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Luxembourg francs, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. 2The participants in the CMEA are Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, the U .S .S .R ., and Viet Nam. 3The countries w i th which bilateral payments agreements were in force as of December 31, 1985 were Albania, Bangladesh, the People's Republic of Ch ina, Colombia, Ghana, Ind ia, Islamic Republic of Iran, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Viet Nam. Set- tlements w i th Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, the German Demo- cratic Republic, Hunga ry, Mongolia, Poland, and the U .S .S .R. take place through the multilateral payments system w i th in the International Bank for Economic Cooperation. 431 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ROMANIA A-Accounts may be debited for payments abroad in any currency, for payments within the country, and for transfers to any other A-, B-, or C-Account. B-Accounts may be debited for all payments abroad in the currencies from which the funds were derived and for payments within Romania. C-Accounts may be debited only for domestic transactions. The transactions permitted for the different accounts do not require any further authoriza- tion. Nonresidents may also keep accounts in lei with the Savings and Consignment Bank. The Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade may accept from nonresident custom- ers time deposits in convertible foreign currencies, on which interest is paid at rates prevailing in international markets. Romanian citizens, including Romanians working abroad who transfer their savings to Romania, may open foreign currency accounts with the Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade or the National Bank. The deposits may be used for payments in foreign currency, at home or abroad, or for exchange into lei at the noncommercial exchange rate. The entire amount of foreign exchange received from abroad for special purposes for the benefit of Romanian citizens (such as the building or purchasing of a house, the purchase of an automobile, the purchase of other goods or services whose prices are expressed in foreign currency, travel abroad, and other purposes) may be used by the recipients. For certain other foreign exchange receipts from abroad, such as inheritances, donations, assistance, or family maintenance, a propor- tion may be deposited in a foreign currency account and the rest must be converted into lei at the noncommercial exchange rate. Imports and Exports The administrative framework for planning and ex- ecuting foreign trade in Romania is provided in the Foreign Trade Law (Law No. 12 of December 1980). International economic activity is organized and carried out in accordance with the principle of working people's self-management and self-administration of economic, financial, and foreign exchange. The general policy targets for foreign trade are set at the central level. Import and export plans are drawn up by the basic economic units, production enterprises, and industrial centrals on the basis of current and long-term needs. The foreign trade plan specifies only a limited number of goods considered of particular importance for the national economy, especially raw materials. The total planned trade does not separate importing or exporting countries but distinguishes between the clear- ing area and the convertible currency area, according to the manner of settlement of exchange payments and receipts. Import and export transactions are carried out on the basis of authorizations issued by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and International Economic Cooperation for each commodity or group of commodities. The authorizations are not restrictive or discriminatory and may be issued, at the request of foreign trade units, for all types of 432 goods, regardless of origin. The Ministry may take measures to curb imports with a view to equilibrating the balance of payments, for the protection of public health, for reasons of national defense and the security of the State, etc., in accordance with the provisions of the GATT. As a rule, annual import authorizations ex- pressed in value terms are issued to individual importing enterprises as a lump sum or for a single kind of product. The authorization stipulates whether import payments are to be made in convertible currency or under bilateral payments arrangements, and, in the latter case, the country is also specified. Export proceeds must be sold to the Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade. Imports for investment in complex installations (as- semblies, subassemblies, machinery, equipment, and spare parts) are delivered to the buying units at domestic prices that are equal to the customs value (calculated by multiplying the external price by the commercial rate) plus customs duties. Imports of consumer goods are delivered to the commercial purchasing units at retail prices less the commercial discount. The difference between prices so derived and prices calculated on the basis of customs value plus customs duties and, in some cases, the turnover tax, is reflected in the financial accounts of the importing foreign trade unit. Imports are subject to customs duties, although duties are not applied to 121 tariff positions and subpositions. Customs duties are temporarily not being levied on imports of raw materials, assemblies, subassemblies, and spare parts for production, repair, and maintenance, totaling about 500 tariff positions and subpositions. The customs tariff is nondiscriminatory. Decree No. 337'/ 1981 issued on November 26, 1981 increased tariffs on personal imports of certain items into Romania above the value limits for the specified goods. The import goods prohibited to individuals include passenger cars with high fuel consumption, minibuses, firearms, and air conditioners. Customs duties on personal imports of a number of consumer durables, such as motorcycles and electrical appliances, are levied at rates of between 100 percent and 300 percent above the applicable customs tariff. Invisibles All transactions in invisibles not connected with foreign trade transactions require general or individual authorization given by either the Ministry of Finance or another appropriate ministry. For most categories of payments in respect of invisibles, foreign exchange is made available automatically once the transaction has been authorized. For travel outside the socialist countries an exchange allocation is provided up to the equivalent of US$70 a trip for each adult. In addition, tourist agencies may organize group or individual trips payable in lei. Receipts from transactions in invisibles must be sold to the Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade, and the foreign currency required for payments in respect of such transactions is bought from the same bank. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution With specified exceptions, travelers with permanent residence in nonsocialist countries must convert at least US$10 a person a day (or the equivalent in other "acceptable" currencies)4 during their stay in Romania. This requirement does not apply to (a) holders of diplomatic and service passports and their families; (b) newspaper and radio and television correspondents accredited to Romania and their families; (c) persons studying in Romania and their spouses; (d) permanent foreign personnel of foreign firms or agencies authorized to operate in Romania (including joint ventures) and their families; (e) guests of socialist units and of other juridical persons in Romania, as well as of international organizations having their headquarters in Romania; (f) children under 14; (g) teachers visiting Romania under agreements for cultural, technical, and scientific cooperation and their families; (h) persons who can be shown to have made payments for tourist services; (i) foreign personnel in assembly works or providing technical assistance in Romania and their families; (j) persons of Romanian origin having foreign citizen- ship or who are stateless; (k) Romanian citizens pos- sessing a valid Romanian passport who are domiciled abroad; (1) persons resident abroad without a valid Romanian passport, but who have not renounced their Romanian citizenship; and (m) parents, spouses, and children of persons in categories (j)-(l). Foreign diplo- mats and tourists, as well as Romanian citizens legally holding foreign currencies, may purchase certain domes- tically produced or imported consumer goods in special- ized shops, against payment in convertible currencies. Foreign tourists may purchase domestically produced and certain imported consumer goods in specialized shops, against payment in convertible currencies. The 4The acceptable currencies, in addition to the U .S. dollar, are Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Greek drachmas, Indian rupees, Israeli sheqalim, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Luxembourg francs, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, Turkish liras, and Yugoslav dinars. ROMANIA import and export of Romanian notes and coin by travelers are prohibited, with the exception of those coming from CMEA member countries, Albania, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; these latter may each bring in or take out up to lei 500 a trip in accordance with agreements concluded with these countries. Capital All inward and outward transfers of foreign exchange must be authorized by the Ministry of Finance. Outward transfers of funds belonging to resident physical persons are not normally permitted. For certain established categories, such as inheritances, reciprocal agreements have been concluded with a number of countries provi- ding for automatic authorization of transfers of specified amounts to and from Romania. The Foreign Trade Law provides for the establishment of joint ventures in Romania and abroad by Romanian economic organizations. Foreigners are also allowed to invest capital in joint ventures in Romania, up to 49 percent of the total capital of the company concerned. The Foreign Trade Law and implementing decrees guarantee the repatriation in foreign currency of the capital and the transfer in foreign currency of profits after taxes. By agreement, the accounts of joint ventures may be kept in an agreed currency. Gold The National Bank has sole authority to purchase or sell gold in any manner, at home or abroad. The Bank, in turn, authorizes certain juridical persons to hold gold, to use it, and to engage in gold transactions. The ownership by physical persons, for domestic and personal use, of jewelry and of artistic and cultural objects of gold is not restricted. Changes During 1985 Prescription of Currency May 7. The bilateral payments agreement with Ecua- dor was terminated. 433 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution RWANDA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Rwanda is the Rwanda Franc, which is pegged to the SDR at RF 102.71 = SDR 1. This fixed relationship is used to determine the midpoint between buying and selling exchange rates quoted by the Banque Nationale du Rwanda (the central bank) for spot delivery of Rwanda francs against the U .S. dollar and other currencies. The National Bank of Belgium informs the National Bank of Rwanda daily of the rates quoted in London for the currencies making up the SDR basket, and this information is used by the National Bank of Rwanda to calculate the rate of the SDR in terms of the U .S. dollar and the rate of the U .S. dollar in terms of Rwanda francs. The National Bank of Belgium also reports the rates quoted in Brussels for the various currencies, including the U .S. dollar, which enables the National Bank of Rwanda to calculate the rates of those currencies in terms of the U .S. dollar. On December 31, 1985 the midpoint between the buying and selling rate for spot delivery of Rwanda francs against the U .S. dol- lar was RF 93.49 per US$1. The buying and selling rates for all currencies are set at 1 percent above and 1 percent below the midpoint, respectively. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Control over foreign exchange transactions and foreign trade is vested in the central bank; authority to carry out some of these transactions is delegated to authorized banks. Exchange policy and foreign trade policy are, in principle, determined by the General Foreign Exchange and Licensing Committee, which is made up of the Minister of Finance, the Governor of the National Bank, and five other members; however, this Committee is inoperative. Prescription of Currency The National Bank has concluded agreements with the central banks of neighboring countries and Kenya, under which settlements are made through reciprocal accounts in convertible domestic currency. Balances on such accounts are periodically transferable. Payments to and from member countries (Burundi, the Comoros, Djib- outi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Rwanda, Somalia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zam- bia, and Zimbabwe) of the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) are made through the PTA's clearing house. Otherwise, payments for imports must be made in the currency approved by the National Bank, which, in principle, is the currency of the country of origin. Payments from any country may be received in Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, deutsche mark, French francs, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, and U .S. dollars. Foreign payments, 434 except in border trade, are generally made by bank transfer; the National Bank may, however, authorize other means of payment such as checks or telegraphic transfers. Exchange transactions with South Africa are prohibited. Imports and Import Payments Imports from South Africa are prohibited. Imports of a few types of goods, such as explosives and weapons, from all sources require prior authorization, for reasons of public security. Imports of narcotics are prohibited. All imports valued at over RF 100,000 c. & f. Kigali require licenses, as do those valued at less than RF 100,000 c. & f. Kigali, if payment is required in foreign exchange. Import licenses for toilet and pow- dered soap, candles, and insecticides are temporarily suspended. No license is required for the import of merchandise valued below RF 100,000 c. & f. Kigali, if payment in foreign exchange is not involved. Imports of household goods and personal effects of nonresidents and resident expatriates are also exempt. For a number of consumer goods, mostly of a luxury nature, the validation of import licenses for payment in foreign exchange is subject to the opening at an authorized bank of an interest-bearing time deposit account for 100 per- cent of the c. & f. value of the imports. The deposits are for three months in the case of imports by air or when the country of origin has a common border with Rwanda or with Kenya; in other cases, the deposit period is six months. Exempt from the import deposit obligation are imports by government bodies and imports of food and beverages by the hotels. The National Bank levies a validation fee of 1 percent of the f .o .b. value on import licenses that involve use of official foreign exchange and on import licenses that are subject to the inspection of the Societe Generate de Surveillance (SGS) of Geneva; the validation fee is 0.1 percent for fuel. The validation of other import licenses is subject to a processing fee of RF 750 in each case. Before orders are placed, applica- tions for import licenses must be submitted to the National Bank through an authorized bank. Unless otherwise specified, the approval of an import license application constitutes an authorization to obtain the required foreign exchange. The National Bank grants global import licenses for certain essential commodities and for limited amounts to individual firms in order to ensure their continuous operation; these are valid for three months (six months in the case of vehicle parts). Global licenses cannot cover both goods subject to the opening of a time deposit account and goods exempted from it. License applica- tions are examined at the National Bank to avoid overinvoicing. Any importer applying for a license must do so on the appropriate form and state that when paying for the imports he will not exceed the credit limit ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution normally allowed under the regulations. Dealers in imported automobiles are required to provide after-sale service for the vehicles. Used automobiles can be imported only if they are less than three years old, and the importer has to assure the availability of spare parts. Imports whose f .o .b. value on the pro forma invoice is greater than RF 1.5 million in the case of ordinary licenses and RF 0.5 million in the case of global licenses are inspected by the SGS for quality and quantity in the country of origin1 prior to shipment, and at the same time prices are verified. Import licenses must be pre- sented when the goods are cleared through customs, and a copy of the customs clearance form must be sent to the National Bank. For imports of products originating in member countries of the Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries (CEPGL), import licenses are replaced by CEPGL import notices. The Rwanda invest- ment code grants special concessions to enterprises under a contractual arrangement, which may imply exemption from import duties on certain types of equipment. Payments for Invisibles The prior approval of the National Bank is required for all payments for invisibles. Foreign exchange is sold by the National Bank, through the authorized banks, for transport and other expenses (except insurance) con- nected with imports and exports. Transfers of the salaries or wages earned by foreign nationals employed in Rwanda under contract are made net of taxes, net of the employee's share of social security contributions, and after deduction of local expenses (calculated by one or the other of two formulas, at the employee's option) — namely (a) 40 percent of gross monthly pay after tax and social security contributions, with a minimum of RF 50,000 a month; or (b) RF 70,000 a month for a head of household plus RF 20,000 a month for each dependent in Rwanda. Transfers of the net earned income of foreign nationals who are self-employed, whether engaged in a profession or established as independent traders, are also made net of taxes and after deduction for local expenses. A fee of RF 750 is levied for transfer authorizations other than those relating to income (broadly defined) received in Rwanda, for which a fee of 1 percent of the amount to be transferred is charged, with a minimum of RF 750. Payments in respect of transport charges on imports cannot be made un t il imported goods have been cleared through customs (except in cases of payment by means of documentary credit payable on loading). Insurance on imports and exports must be taken out locally, with an insurance company constituted under Rwanda law. Net 'Except for imports from Afghan is tan, Albania, Burkina Faso, Burund i, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the People's Republic of China, the Comoros, Djibouti, Gabon, Guinea, Iraq, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Lao People's Democratic Repub l ic, Liberia, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Mali, Niger, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Syrian Arab Republic, Tanzania, Uganda, U .S .S .R ., Viet Nam, Yemen Arab Republic, People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, and Zaire. RWANDA profits and dividends due to nonresidents may, in principle, be remitted abroad in fu l l, subject to the right of the National Bank to prescribe their transfer in installments. The purchase in domestic currency of tickets for travel abroad requires the prior approval of the National Bank. Authorizations for the purchase of foreign exchange for tickets and foreign exchange relating to travel for reasons of leisure, vacation, family, religion, conferences or sports are suspended until further notice. Travel for business and official purposes is restricted to the essen- tial minimum, and foreign residents working in Rwanda are allowed only one economy-class airline ticket every two years of actual service in Rwanda, more than one trip being permissible only if the total cost of tickets does not exceed that of one full-fare ticket. Remittances for payments for certain other invisibles may be authorized on an ad hoc basis. Travelers may take out domestic bank notes up to RF 5,000. Residents require authorization by the Na- tional Bank to take out foreign bank notes. Nonresident travelers may take out any amount in foreign bank notes brought with them upon entry less the amount of their expenditures in Rwanda. Commercial banks are not permitted to export domestic bank notes. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to South Africa are prohibited. All exports, except trade samples, personal and household effects of travelers, and merchandise valued at less than RF 20,000, are subject to prior declaration. Declarations for all exports must be presented to the National Bank through an authorized bank for certification, for which a fee of RF 750 is levied. A declaration is valid for three months, but extensions may be granted by the National Bank, which also reserves the right to determine the conditions for certification. For exports to Burundi, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zaire, payment must be collected not later than 30 days after the goods have left the country; this deadline is not applicable to exports under CEPGL export notices, for which there is a quarterly clearing arrangement among the central banks. The maximum permissible period for repatriation of proceeds from exports to all other countries is 120 days. All exchange proceeds from exports must be surrendered to an authorized bank within eight days from their collection. Proceeds from Invisibles All receipts from invisibles must be surrendered to the authorized banks within eight days from their collection. The collection of claims resulting from services per- formed for nonresidents must take place within 30 days of the due date. Travelers from abroad may bring in up to RF 5,000 in domestic bank notes and any amount in foreign bank notes. Declaration of means of payment on entering Rwanda is optional. Commercial banks are not permitted to import domestic bank notes. 435 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution RWANDA Capital All outward transfers of capital require the prior approval of the National Bank. Such approval is rarely given unless the transfer relates to a foreign investment in Rwanda that is covered by the Investment Law or to the personal effects of a foreign national returning to his own country. Repatriation guarantees may be given by the National Bank in respect of short-term capital inflows remaining in Rwanda for at least two months. Outward transfer of proceeds from sales of real estate is sus- pended. Foreign financing of imports is subject to guidelines limiting the number of eligible products, establishing a limit of 180 days from the date of shipment on the maturity of the financing, and specifying acceptable interest rates and commissions. Gold Residents may purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in Rwanda for numismatic purposes only. With this excep- tion, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry. Imports and exports of gold require licenses. Changes During 1985 Imports and Import Payments March 12. Imports of cement were suspended until further notice. Payments for Invisibles September 16. Sales of movable items by a foreign resident or a nonresident to a resident in an amount of RF 500,000 or more were made subject to prior authorization by the National Bank of Rwanda in cases when such sales were not effected in the context of a normal commercial activity legally exercised by the parties involved. 436 ©International Monetary Fund.

CHRISTOPHER AND NEVIS (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of St. Christopher and Nevis is the Eastern Caribbean do l la r ,l which is issued by the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) and is pegged to the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, at EC$2.70 = US$1. On December 31, 1985 the buy ing and selling rates were EC$2.6949 and EC$2.7084, respectively, per US$1. The ECCB also quotes daily rates for the Canadian dollar and the pound sterling. St. Christopher and Nevis formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from December 3, 1984. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Ministry of Finance and applies to all countries. Prescription of Currency Settlements with residents of ECCB countries must be in Eastern Caribbean dollars. Foreign Currency Accounts U .S. dollar currency accounts may be operated freely, but to operate other foreign currency accounts, permis- sion of the Ministry of Finance is required; such permission is normally confined to major exporters and foreign nationals not ordinarily residing in St. Chris- topher and Nevis. These accounts can only be credited with foreign currency earned or received from outside St. Christopher and Nevis, and can be freely debited. A m in imum balance of US$1,000 must be maintained at all times to operate a U .S. dollar currency account. Imports and Import Payments Most goods are imported under open general licenses. Individual licenses are required for imports that compete with local products unless they come from another CARICOM coun t ry .2 Payments for authorized imports payable in U .S. dollars are permitted on presentation of documentary evidence of purchase to a bank, but payments in currencies other than the U .S. dollar need the approval of the Ministry of Finance.

Residents of St. Christopher and Nevis may purchase foreign exchange from authorized banks up to the equivalent of EC$ 1,500 a year for travel outside the ECCB area, subject to presentation of evidence of intention to travel in bona fide cases. For business travel, allowances of foreign exchange may be made available up to EC$5,000 a year per company. These allocations can be increased in bona fide cases with the authorization of the Ministry of Finance.

Not for Redistribution SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Sao Tome and Principe is the Sao Tome and Principe Dobra, which is pegged to the SDR at Db 45.25 = SDR 1. The middle rate quoted by the National Bank of Sao Tome and Principe (the central bank) for the dobra against the U.S. dollar, the interven- tion currency, is determined on the basis of the daily calculation of the U.S. dollar-SDR rate. Buying and selling rates for certain other currencies are also deter- mined on the basis of the Fund's daily calculations of the exchange rates of these currencies with respect to the SDR. Charges on purchases and sales of foreign exchange are influenced by the relatively high processing cost of transactions with the rest of the world, reflecting the limited communication facilities. Foreign exchange transactions are divided into three categories for the purposes of these charges —namely, import payments, transactions in foreign checks, and collection of export proceeds. (i) On import-related exchange transactions, the ar- rangements are as follows: on the opening of a letter of credit, a charge of 1.125 percent of the import value is payable, with an additional commission to the National Bank of 0.5 percent. A stamp duty of Db 2 per Db 1,000 of import value, plus a flat Db 50, is also payable, as well as a postage levy of Db 50. Any change in the letter of credit carries a further charge of Db 150. (ii) On foreign checks for collection, the National Bank applies a commission in favor of the collecting foreign correspondents, varying according to the particu- lar bank. In addition, the National Bank charges a postage levy of Db 20 for each transaction, together with a stamp duty of Db 15. In the period between payment of the import cost by the bank and receipt of funds from the importer, an interest rate of 6.5 percent per annum is charged on the loan. (iii) For collection of export proceeds, the National Bank charges a commission of 0.25 percent when opening the letter of credit and a further 0.125 percent when the funds are received. In addition, a postage levy of Db 500 is charged. Administration of Control All foreign exchange transactions are under the con- trol of the National Bank. The exchange controls are applied flexibly, and exceptions to the stated limits are permitted on an ad hoc basis. All foreign exchange proceeds must be surrendered to the National Bank, and all exchange payments must be made through that Bank. Import and export licenses are granted by the Directorate of External Commerce. Prescription of Currency The National Bank may prescribe the currency in which foreign exchange transactions shall be made. There are bilateral payments agreements with Cape Verde and the German Democratic Republic. Under the agreement with the German Democratic Republic, Sao Tome and Principe imports building supplies, equipment, and raw materials for the con- struction and operation of the brewery and ceramics factory, as well as certain consumer goods, especially meat. The quantity of these goods to be imported is specified in annual protocols under the agreement. In return, Sao Tome and Principe is required to export to the German Democratic Republic a quantity of cocoa not below 1,500 tons each year. The agreement stipulates that the export price is to be established on the basis of the average world market price of 1980; however, if the world market price should subsequently rise above this level, a new contract would be negotiated. Transactions under the payments agreement with Cape Verde have normally covered Sao Tome and Principe's imports from Cape Verde, as well as receipts and payments for various services and transfers. The agree- ment provides for the central banks of the two countries to grant each other reciprocal noninterest credits of US$200,000; it also states that, should this balance be depleted and a debit balance persist for more than six months, the imbalance will be redressed by appropriate trade transactions between the two parties. Imports and Import Payments The state-owned foreign trading enterprise (EcoMEX), which has exclusive authority for most import activity, issues its own import licenses, but these must be approved by the National Bank. Exceptions to this exclusive authority are fuels and lubricants (imported by EMCO, the fuel enterprise), medications (imported by ENAMED, the pharmaceutical enterprise), and inputs for three foreign-financed projects. In these nonexclusive cases, import licenses must also be approved by the National Bank. For all imports, licenses are issued in accordance with Advance Import Registration Bulletins, which are valid for six months, but may be extended if necessary. The license specifies the quantity and the c . i .f. and f .o .b. values of the product to be imported, together with the currency of settlement. Licenses are granted under the annual import plan, taking into account the availability of foreign exchange and the country's supply and economic development require- ments. Prepayment for imports is permitted only through the opening of letters of credit. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles are approved within limits established by the National Bank. These limits, which allow for additional amounts in justifiable cases, include those on (1) transfers for medical treatment abroad when local facilities are insufficient; (2) transfers of remit- tances to students; (3) transfers of savings from earnings 443 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE when under technical cooperation agreements with the Government; and (4) transfers for payment of fares, freight, costs of communication with foreign countries, etc. Purchases of foreign exchange by residents for tourism are strictly limited, although air fares may be paid in domestic currency. Individual expenditures on airline tickets by private citizens for travel abroad are required not to exceed Db 40,000 in value over a three- year period. Transfers of profits by foreign companies established in Sao Tome and Principe prior to indepen- dence have been suspended. There are no limitations on remittances for subscriptions to periodicals, books, etc., or on the payments of interest on external debt. Foreign exchange allowances for medical purposes are permitted up to Db 10,000 for a period of one month. Transfers of pension payments or social security pay- ments are also permitted for nonresident nationals who had been receiving such allowances by 1980. Payments for technical assistance and other services in the national interest are allowed. At the beginning of the school year, a student may receive a special transfer of up to Db 5,000 a year for expenses related to courses taken abroad; additional amounts may be granted if approved by the Ministry of Education and Culture. All payments related to invisibles are subject to a stamp tax of 2 percent of value, or 4 percent if payment is made through a telegraphic transfer. A postage levy of Db 20 is payable on all transactions. Foreign travelers may take out in foreign exchange an amount not greater than the total sum declared upon entry. For this purpose, it is expected that the daily expenses of a tourist will not be less than Db 3,000. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports require an export license, as set out in Advance Export Registration Bulletins, which specify the quantity and c . i . f. or f .o .b. value of the export. All export proceeds must be received through the National Bank. The state-owned foreign trading enterprise (EcoMEX) is responsible for all export activity. Proceeds from Invisibles Travelers may bring exchange. in any amount of foreign Capital Inward foreign investments are governed by the Investment Code (Decree Law No. 30/80, of August 5, 1980). Transfers are permitted for repayment of financ- ing under agreements with the Government and for the amortization of private sector investments in activities considered to be in the national interest. Personnel under technical assistance programs are allowed to transfer their savings in accordance with the terms of their contracts. Gold Exports and imports of gold require special authoriza- tion by the National Bank.

Not for Redistribution SAUDI ARABIA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Saudi Arabia is the Saudi Arabian R iya l, wh ich is pegged to the SDR at SRls 4.28255 = SDR 1. In principle, margins not exceeding 7.25 percent are allowed around the fixed relationship; these margins were suspended on Ju ly 22, 1981. The middle rate of the Saudi Arabian riyal for the U .S. dollar, the interven- tion currency, quoted by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency is determined on the basis of the Fund 's daily calculation of the U .S. dollar-SDR rate. On Decem- ber 31, 1985 the Monetary Agency's middle rate for the U.S. dollar was SRls 3.645; it sold U .S. dollars to banks at SRls 3.650 per US$1 and bought from banks and the principal producer of petroleum at SRls 3.640 per US$1; these rates served as the basis for exchange quotations in the market, the banks being permitted to charge up to 0.25 percent above and below the Monetary Agency's buying and selling rates. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Saudi Arabia formally accepted the obligations of Article V I I I, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agree- ment, as from March 22, 1961. Prescription of Currency The use of the currencies of Israel and South Africa is proh ib i ted .l No other prescription of currency require- ments are in force. Imports and Import Payments Import licenses are not required, and exchange for payments abroad may be obtained free ly. The importa- tion of a few commodities is prohibited for reasons of religion, health, or security; importation of certain other items in specified forms is also prohibited. Some imports are subject to customs duties at rates ranging between 7 percent and 20 percent; imports from member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) are exempted, provided that at least 40 percent of the value added in each case is effected in GCC countries and that the capital of the producing firm is at least 51 percent owned by citizens of GCC member countries. Certain imports from Lebanon are subject to proof of origin requirements. Exports and Export Proceeds Export licenses are not required, and no control is exercised over export proceeds. The re-export of certain imported items benef i t ing from government subsidy is prohibited. ' In add i t ion, all imports from these countries and a ll exports to these countries are prohibited; paymen ts may not be made to them or be received from them for all types of transac t ions whe ther of a current or capital na tu re. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments for and proceeds from invisibles are not restricted. Travelers may freely import and export Saudi Arabian bank notes and coin. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or payments by residents or nonresidents. The Monetary Agency has issued guidelines to its foreign correspondent banks requiring them to seek approval prior to the flotation of riyal-denominated loans. Local banks are prohibited from inv i t ing foreign banks to participate in riyal-denominated syndicated transactions inside or outside Saudi Arabia w i thout prior approval of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency. Prior approval by the Monetary Agency is also required for participation by local banks in either riyal-syndicated transactions arranged abroad or foreign-currency- syndicated transactions arranged for nonresidents. The Foreign Capital Investment Law provides for specified benefits to be extended to approved foreign investments in Saudi Arabia. Approved foreign capital enjoys the same privileges as domestic capital under the 1962 Law for the Protection and Promotion of National Industry. Foreign capital invested in industrial or agricultural projects w i th at least 25 percent Saudi Arabian partici- pation is exempt from income and corporate tax for ten years after production has begun. Borrowing from foreign banks is subject to a withholding tax on the repatriation of interest earnings. Gold The monetary authorities and all other residents, inc lud ing private persons, may freely and without license purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad. They may also, without a license and without payment of any customs duty or tax, import and export gold in any form, with the exception of 14-karat gold, the import of which is prohibited. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement In terms of the middle rate, and following a change in the rate in February from SRls 3.575 = US$1 to SRls 3.595 = US$1, the Saudi Arabian riyal was devalued against the U .S. dollar in March and June by 0.3 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively. Imports and Import Payments March 22. The m in imum tariff on dutiable imports was raised from 4 percent to 7 percent. July 22.

Not for Redistribution SENEGAL (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Senegal is the CFA Franc ,l which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. The official buying and selling rates are CFAF 50 = F 1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market and the fixed rate between the French franc and the CFA franc. The BCEAO levies a commission of 0.10 per mill for transfers from countries outside the West African Mone- tary Union (WAMU) and one of 2.50 per mill for transfers to such countries.2 An exchange commission of 0.125-1.0 per mill, depending on the amount, is charged by the banks on purchases or sales of foreign exchange other than those directly related to external transactions. In addition, they levy a commission on transfers to all countries outside the West African Monetary Union, 72 percent of which must be surrendered to the Treasury through the Central Bank. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of measures relating to gold and the repatriation of export proceeds, Senegal's exchange controls do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Cote d'lvoire, Gabon, Mali, Niger, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Directorate of Money and Credit in the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Part of the approval authority in respect of exchange control has been delegated to the BCEAO and to authorized banks. The BCEAO is authorized to collect, either directly or through the banks, other financial institutions, the Postal Administration, and notaries public, any information necessary to compile balance of payments statistics. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through authorized banks, the Postal Administration, or the BCEAO. Export authorizations and prior import authori- zations are issued for listed products by the Ministry of Commerce. 'The CFA franc is issued by the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de 1'Ouest (BCEAO) and is the common currency in Ben in, Burkina Faso, Cote d'lvoire, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo. 2Transfers between member countries of the Union are subject to a m in imum flat commission of CFAF 100 levied on settlements between agencies of the BCEAO. 446 Prescription of Currency Since Senegal is an Operations Account country, settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other Operations Account country. Current transactions with The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are normally settled through the West African Clearing House. Set- tlements with all other countries are usually effected through correspondent banks in France, in any of the currencies of those countries, or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. All settlements with South Africa are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. The crediting to nonresident accounts of CFA bank notes, French bank notes, or bank notes issued by any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account is not permitted, except for BCEAO bank notes mailed to the BCEAO agency in Dakar by an authorized bank's foreign correspondent; such bank notes may be credited to a Foreign Account in Francs opened by the latter with an authorized bank in Senegal. Foreign Accounts in Francs may be debited, without prior authorization, with the value of BCEAO bank notes mailed by authorized intermediaries directly to their foreign correspondents. Imports and Import Payments Imports originating in or proceeding from South Africa are prohibited, and the import of certain goods is prohibited from all countries except member states of the West African Economic Community (WAEC). The import from any source of a number of other com- modities is subject to prior authorization. Imports from countries in the French Franc Area are generally free of license and quantitative restriction; some goods, al- though free from import license, require prior authoriza- tion by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Imports of virtually all goods from EC countries (the six original member states) and imports of some goods from all countries of the former Organization for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC), the United States, and Canada are free of quantitative restriction; such liberalized imports require only an import certificate made out by the importer himself. Imports of certain goods from countries outside the EC, the French Franc Area, or the West African Economic Community are subject to prior authorization. All import transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled w i th an authorized bank when their ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution value exceeds CFAF 100,000 (delivered at the Senegal- ese border or c . i . f . ). The exchange authorizations entitle importers to purchase the necessary exchange, but not earlier than eight days before shipment if a documentary credit is opened, or the due date for settlement if the commodities have already been imported (if no docu- mentary credit has been opened, on presentation of the bill of lading). Furthermore, payments for imports may not be made prior to customs clearance. Payments for Invisibles All payments to South Africa are prohibited. Pay- ments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to exchange approval. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transac- tion has been approved or does not require authorization. Authorized intermediary banks are empowered to effect any payment abroad up to CFAF 20,000 on behalf of residents without requiring documents. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted, on the basis of a request for exchange authorization submitted to the Ministry of Finance. For tourist travel, residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may obtain an exchange allocation equivalent to CFAF 200,000 a year for each person (CFAF 100,000 for children under 10); any foreign exchange remaining after return to Senegal must be surrendered. Applications for additional amounts of foreign exchange may also be approved. For business travel, there is a special allocation of the equivalent of CFAF 20,000 a day, subject to a max imum of CFAF 300,000 a person a trip, but not more than the equivalent of CFAF 20,000 in BCEAO bank notes or its equivalent in currency notes issued by the Bank of France or a bank of issue linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account may be taken. The transfer of the fu ll net salary of a foreigner working in Senegal is permitted upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher, provided that the transfer takes place within three months following the pay period; however, for Mauritanian nationals working in Senegal the trans- ferable portion is limited to 50 percent or 80 percent, depending on family status and residence, except for leave salaries, which are transferable in fu l l. Resident and nonresident travelers to foreign countries may take out, in addition to any foreign exchange allocation, up to CFAF 20,000 in BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, and bank notes of other Operations Account countries. Resident travelers to other countries of the French Franc Area may take out any amount in BCEAO bank notes, bu t, if proceeding to a country that is not a member of the West African Monetary Un ion, they must declare to the customs the amount taken out if it exceeds CFAF 200,000. SENEGAL Nonresident travelers may freely take out any means of payment, such as traveler's checks, issued abroad in their name. However, the export of foreign bank notes in amounts in excess of the equivalent of CFAF 50,000 is authorized only up to the amount declared by them on entry (m inus sales of foreign exchange in Senegal and plus any repurchases up to CFAF 50,000). Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. With a few exceptions (e .g ., gold, diamonds, tuna fish), exports to countries in the French Franc Area are free of prior authorization. Most exports to other countries require authorization mainly in order to assure adequate supplies for domestic needs and to prevent certain re-exports. Certain nontraditional exports are eligible for an export subsidy equivalent to 15 percent of f .o .b. value, de- signed to promote exports to nonmember countries of the Economic Community of West Africa. The scheme covers agricultural equ ipmen t, canned fish, fertilizers, shoes, textiles, and products in excess supply on the domestic market or for which output could easily be increased. Proceeds from exports to foreign countries, inc lud ing countries of the French Franc Area, must normally be collected within 120 days of the arrival of the goods at their destination and repatriated not later than one month after the due date. All export transac- tions exceeding CFAF 500,000 must be domiciled with an authorized intermediary bank. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles w i th France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be collected and surrendered, if received in foreign currency, w i th in one month of the due date or the date of receipt. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BCEAO, the Bank of France, or any bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account w i th the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) of countries outside the French Franc Area; residents bringing in foreign bank notes must declare them to the customs upon entry and sell them to an authorized bank w i th in eight days. Capital All settlements between Senegal and South Africa are prohibited. Capital movements between Senegal and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require approval by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. Controls are maintained over borrowing abroad, over inward direct investment and all outward investment, 447 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SENEGAL and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Senegal. Such operations require prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. Exempt from authorization, however, are oper- ations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Senegalese Government, and (2) shares that are identical w i th, or may be substituted for, securities whose issue, offering, or sale in Senegal has previously been authorized. With the exception of controls over foreign securities, these measures do not apply to France, Monaco, member countries of the West African Monetary Union, and the Operations Account countries. Special controls are maintained also over imports and exports of gold, over the soliciting of funds for deposit with foreign private persons and foreign firms and institutions, and over publicity aimed at placing funds abroad or at subscribing to real estate and building operations abroad; these special controls also apply to France, Monaco, and the Operations Account countries. All investments abroad by residents of Senegal require prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance;3 75 percent of such investments must be financed with borrowing abroad. Foreign direct invest- ments in Senegal4 must be declared to the Minister of Economy and Finance before such investments are made. The Minister has a period of two months from receipt of the declaration, during which he may request postponement of the project. Both the making and the liquidating of direct and other investments, whether these are Senegalese investments abroad or foreign investments in Senegal, must be reported to the Minister and the BCEAO within 20 days following each opera- tion. Direct investments constitute investments implying control of a company or enterprise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. Lending abroad requires prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. 3 Including investments made through foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in Senegal and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Senegal. 4Inc lud ing those made by companies in Senegal which are directly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in Senegal of foreign companies. Borrowing by residents from nonresidents requires prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. The following are, however, exempt from th is authorization: (1) borrowings constituting a direct invest- ment, which are subject to prior declaration, as indicated above; (2) borrowings contracted by authorized banks; (3) borrowings other than those mentioned above, subject to certain conditions, when their total amount outstanding, including the new borrowing, does not exceed CFAF 40 million. The repayment of borrowings not constituting a direct investment requires the special authorization of the Minister of Economy and Finance if the borrowing itself was subject to such approval, but is exempt if it was exempt from special authorization. The Investment Code provides various facilities and benefits for approved foreign investments in Senegal. There are special facilities for export industries estab- lished in the Dakar export-processing zone. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Senegal. Imports and exports of gold (gold jewelry and gold materials) from or to any other country require prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. Exempt from this requirement are: (1) imports and exports by the Treasury or the BCEAO; (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles); and (3) imports and exports by travelers of gold articles up to a combined weight of 200 grams. Brokers in precious metals require an authorization from the Minister of Economy and Finance to conduct their business. Imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Purchases abroad of nonmonetary gold are subject to a tax of 25 percent. Commercial imports of gold jewelry require prior import authorization by the Minister of Commerce, and imports of ornaments require the prior advice of the Senegal Corporation for the Promotion of Art Handicrafts (Societe Senegalaise pour la Promotion de UArtisanat d'Art) and the Directorate of Mines and Geology.

Not for Redistribution SEYCHELLES (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Seychelles is the Seychelles Rupee, which is pegged to the SDR at SR 7.2345 = SDR 1. Exchange rates for various currencies (including the pound sterling, the intervention currency) are quoted on the basis of their New York closing rates for the U .S. dollar on the previous day, using the U .S. dollar rate for the Seychelles rupee as derived from the fixed parity to the SDR. These rates are circulated daily to the commercial banks by the Central Bank. On Decem- ber 31, 1985 the buying and selling rates of the Central Bank of the Seychelles for the pound sterling were SR 9.4980 and SR 9.5931, respectively, per £ stg. 1. The Central Bank charges a commission of 0.125 per- cent for buying and 0.875 percent for selling of pounds sterling and U .S. dollars. The commercial banks are authorized to deal in pounds sterling and other currencies at rates based on the exchange rates circulated daily by the Central Bank for the respective currencies. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Seychelles formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from January 3, 1978. Administration of Control and Prescription of Currency There is no exchange control, and there are no prescription of currency requirements. The Seychelles Marketing Board exercises controls on foreign trade and domestic marketing; its Import Division and Import Control Unit perform regulatory and commercial roles previously handled by the Seychelles National Commod- ity Corporation (SEYCOM). Imports and Import Payments No restrictions are placed on payments for imports. Importers are required to obtain import licenses from the Seychelles Licensing Authority and to apply for im- port permits from the Import Control section of the Seychelles Marketing Board. Certain basic food items can be imported only by the Seychelles Marketing Board. The import of a few luxury items is controlled through a quota system. Most imports are subject to duties, with a preferential schedule of rates applying to goods originating in Commonwealth, ACP, and EC countries. Payments for Invisibles There are no restrictions on payments for invisibles, and no limits are imposed on the provision of travel exchange. Travelers may take or send out of Seychelles any amount of domestic or foreign currency. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports normally do not require licenses. Exports of copra, cinnamon, and fish (the principal exports) are the monopoly of the Seychelles Marketing Board. Residents may export goods without exchange control formality to any country, except South Africa. Export proceeds need not be repatriated or surrendered. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles may be disposed of freely. Overseas visitors may bring in any amount of currency for travel expenditure. Capital No restrictions are imposed on inward or outward capital payments. Outward transfers of overseas-owned capital are allowed without limit. Whether or not they have been granted temporary residential status, non- nationals are permitted to repatriate their surplus earn- ings without limit. New investment outside Seychelles by permanent residents and by companies and other organizations operating in Seychelles is not subject to any limitation. Foreign investment (whether portfolio, direct invest- ment, increased investment in existing entities in the form of loans, or equity capital) is free of restrictions. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad, but dealings in gold bullion are restricted to authorized dealers. Two commemorative gold coins in denominations of SR 1,500 and SR 1,000 have been issued and are legal tender. Another gold coin in the denomination of SR 20 issued in December 1983 in commemoration of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the Central Bank is also legal tender, and a fourth issue (in the denomination of SR 25) was made in April 1984 to mark the World Fisheries Conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

All imports were made subject to permits issued by the Import Control section of the Seychelles Marketing Board, and to importers, licenses obtainable from the Seychelles Licensing Authority. The regula- tions also required importers to state commodity, source, quan t i ty, and price when applying for a permit, and to effect importation of the stated quantity within the period specified in the application. In addition, the public monopoly over the importation of certain food staples was extended to other basic foodstuffs, and its imple- mentation was transferred to the Import Division of the Seychelles Marketing Board, ExP°rts and ExPort Pro^eds February 1. Exports of copra, cinnamon, and fish were brought under the exclusive monopoly of the Seychelles Marketing Board. 450 ©International Monetary Fund.

On December 31, 1985 the Bank of Sierra Leone's buying and selling rates in the official market were Le 5.2110 = US$1 and Le 5.2715 = US$1, respectively. The Bank of Sierra Leone deals at the official market rate only in pounds sterling and in the U .S. dollar; daily rates for the pound sterling are determined on the basis of the U .S. dollar-pound sterling rate, subject to a maximum commission of 1 percent on the selling side only. Rates for other currencies are determined on the basis of the U .S. dollar rates for the respective currencies in the London market. Administration of Control Exchange control policy is determined by the Ministry of Finance, in consultation with the Bank of Sierra Leone, but the day-to-day administration of exchange control is carried out by the Bank of Sierra Leone with the assistance of the commercial banks. Import licenses are issued by the Ministry of Trade and Industry within the framework of the foreign exchange budget. Autho- rized dealers may sell foreign exchange for licensed imports and for travel expenses within specified limits. Prescription of Currency Transactions with all countries are subject to exchange control. Certain settlements with the People's Republic of China must be channeled through clearing accounts established under the terms of a bilateral payments agreement. Payments for imports from other countries may be made in leones to the credit of an External Account, in the currency of the exporting country, in pounds sterling, or in U .S. dollars. Settlements with the Central Bank of West African States (for Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'lvoire, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo) and The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, and Nigeria are normally made through the West African Clearing House. Re- ceipts from exports other than diamonds to countries other than the People's Republic of China may be obtained in leones from an External Account, in the currency of the importing country, or in any specified currency. * Receipts from all exports must be obtained in the currency of the importing country or in any other specified currency, and surrendered through the banking system of Sierra Leone. 'Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, CFA francs, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and U .S. dollars. Nonresident Accounts Accounts in leones held w i th authorized banks in Sierra Leone by residents of countries outside Sierra Leone are designated External Accounts. In addition, there are Blocked Accounts, to which are credited amounts due to nonresidents that may not be remitted abroad. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Namibia and South Africa are prohibited. Import licenses for all goods under Open General License are issued freely, but this provision does not apply to the approximately 90 items on the Specific Import License List. Priority in licensing the items under Specific Import Licenses is given to essential items, such as petroleum, sugar, essential foods, raw materials, and spare parts. Import orders may be placed only after receipt of import licenses and foreign exchange ap- proval. All imports must be made against letters of credit with local commercial banks. There are outstanding arrears on import payments. All imports not specifically exempted by the Minister of Finance are subject to an invoice entry fee and to an import licensing fee, both equal to 12 percent of the c . i . f. value and payable at the time of importation; the rate for imports from countries belonging to the Eco- nomic Community of West African States is 5 percent. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to nonresidents are made from commercial banks' working balances on approval by the Bank of Sierra Leone. With appropriate documentation, foreign exchange for such purchases as basic travel allowance of up to US$1,000 a year may be purchased directly from authorized dealers. Remittances of earn- ings by foreign nationals are limited, in principle, to US$6,500, or 40 percent of net taxable annual wages and salaries, whichever is lower, but the Bank of Sierra Leone may permit the transfer of larger amounts. Insurance on imported goods must be taken out with insurance companies incorporated in Sierra Leone. The buying commission for agents abroad is not normally permitted to exceed 3 percent, and bank charges, financing commissions, and other financial charges on imports also are not normally allowed. There are arrears on payments for current invisibles, including interest on official debt. For travel abroad, residents are entitled to a basic exchange allowance of US$1,000 a person a calendar year. Applications for larger amounts are considered on an individual basis. In addition to the basic exchange allowance, travelers may take out, regardless of destina- tion, Le 20 in leone notes and the equivalent of Le 250 in 451 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SIERRA LEONE foreign currency notes. Nonresident travelers may take out any foreign currency bank notes, including sterling notes, declared by them when entering Sierra Leone. Travel abroad is subject to a travel tax of 10 percent of the price of the ticket, payable at the time of purchase of the ticket. Exports and Export Proceeds With the exception of some commodities, the exporta- tion of which is restricted to certain state corporations, export licenses are granted by the Ministry of Trade and Industry for the export of all commodities to all countries except Namibia and South Africa. The proceeds of exports, including diamonds and other minerals, must be received in the currency of the importing country or in any other specified currency agreed to by the Bank of Sierra Leone; the proceeds must be received by the exporter and sold to an authorized bank in Sierra Leone or the Bank of Sierra Leone within 30 days from the date of export, or 60 days for diamonds and 45 days for coffee and cocoa, unless permission to do otherwise is obtained. The buying and exporting of diamonds are carried out by locally licensed firms and by several foreign companies under the supervision of the Govern- ment Gold and Diamond Office (GGDO), which is charged with the responsibility of monitoring accruable export proceeds from the sale of gold and diamonds. In addition to the Bank of Sierra Leone, gold may be exported by licensed private exporters, who are, how- ever, required to buy domestic gold only from licensed miners or dealers. Proceeds from specified traditional exports must be surrendered to the Bank of Sierra Leone, w i th the exception of gold and diamond exporters who are allowed to retain 25 percent of their foreign exchange earnings and to surrender the balance of 75 percent to the Bank of Sierra Leone through the GGDO; proceeds from all other exports may be surrendered either to the Bank of Sierra Leone or any authorized bank in Sierra Leone. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in specified currencies (see footnote 1) must be offered for sale to an authorized bank within 30 days. Subject to declaration upon entry, persons entering Sierra Leone may bring in any amount of foreign currency, and a m in imum of US$100 (or its equivalent) must be encashed by each arriving foreigner. The importation of domestic bank notes is limited to Le 20 for each traveler. Capital Capital payments to nonresidents of Sierra Leone are subject to exchange control. Residents of Sierra Leone require permission from the Bank of Sierra Leone to purchase foreign currency securities or real estate situ- ated abroad. Investments by nonresidents may be repatri- ated at any time, together with profits, subject to foreign exchange availability and provided that exchange control permission was obtained initially for the investment. 452 The Sierra Leone Exchange Control Act of 1954 imposes control on the issue and transfer of securities. The placing of an issue in Sierra Leone requires permission if either the person acquiring the securities or the person for whom he is nominee is resident outside Sierra Leone. Permission must also be obtained before a security registered in Sierra Leone may be transferred to a nonresident. Capital in respect of securities registered in Sierra Leone may not be transferred abroad without permission. Where permission has been given for securi- ties registered in Sierra Leone to be sold to persons resident abroad, the company is usually required to obtain bank certification of the funds brought into Sierra Leone. The Development Ordinance of 1960 and the Development of Industries Ac t, 1983 provide for income tax and customs duty concessions to foreign and domes- tic companies undertaking industrial or agricultural activities that are needed for the development of the country. Noncitizens are prohibited from owning or controlling certain types of business. Residents of Sierra Leone must sell their foreign exchange holdings to an authorized dealer. Exemption is granted for authorized dealers, diplomats, and holders of sterling assets held prior to June 24, 1972 for which exemption has been claimed and granted by the Bank of Sierra Leone. Exempted securities may be sold outside the former Sterling Area, and any income therefrom may be retained in the former Sterling Area or reinvested in other Sterling Area securities. Any certificate of securi- ties purchased with the proceeds of the sale of securities exempted under th is permission is exempt from deposit requirements. Any assets held outside the former Ster- ling Area by any foreign national temporarily resident in Sierra Leone are also exempt from surrender and deposit requirements, provided that exemption has been claimed and granted by an authorized dealer or by the Bank of Sierra Leone. Holdings of working balances in foreign exchange by commercial banks are subject to ceilings; foreign ex- change inf lows above the permitted limits must be surrendered to the Bank of Sierra Leone. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in Sierra Leone for numismatic purposes. Also, residents and nonresidents may freely purchase, hold, sell, or export certain Sierra Leonean commemorative gold coins. With these exceptions, licenses are required for purchases and sales of gold in any form other than jewelry; residents must declare and make available to the Government gold held in the form of bars or coin. Imports of gold in any form other than jewelry constitut- ing the personal effects of a traveler require individual import licenses, wh ich are not normally granted. Travel- ers do not require a license to take out personal jewelry if the value of the total gold and p la t inum content does not exceed Le 200. Exports of unworked gold are not subject to export tax. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement February 21.

Exports and Export Proceeds December 17. The Government established the Gov- ernment Gold and Diamond Office (GGDO), with authority to buy, examine, assort, value, parcel, market, and export gold and diamonds. Under the arrangement, exporters of gold and diamonds were permitted to retain 25 percent of export proceeds for their imports of essential goods and machinery related to mining opera- tions; the remaining 75 percent should be surrendered to the Bank of Sierra Leone. 453 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SINGAPORE (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Singapore is the Singapore Dollar. Singapore follows a policy under which the Singapore dollar is permitted to float, and the monetary authority of Singapore monitors its value against a trade-weighted basket of currencies representing Singapore's major trading partners. The exchange rate of the Singapore dollar in terms of the U .S dollar, the intervention currency, is determined daily in the foreign exchange market. The Interbank buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar on December 31, 1985 were S$2.1045 and S$2.1055, respectively, per US$1. Rates for other currencies are established on the basis of the daily rate for the U .S. dollar and their cross rates in international markets. Banks are free to deal spot and forward in all currencies. Singapore and Brunei currency notes and coins are freely interchangeable, at par and without charge, in Singapore and Brunei. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Foreign currency futures are traded at the Singapore International Monetary Exchange. Singapore formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agree- ment, as from November 9, 1968. Administration of Control There are no exchange control formalities but the Monetary Authority of Singapore retains responsibility for exchange control matters. The Trade Development Board under the Ministry of Trade and Industry adminis- ters and registers imports and exports. Prescription of Currency There are no prescription of currency requirements. Nonresident Accounts There is no distinction between accounts of residents and nonresidents of Singapore. Debits and credits to all accounts may be made freely. Imports and Import Payments Virtually all imports are permitted freely. A few imports are controlled for health, safety, or security reasons. All imports originating in South Africa or any territory administered by it are prohibited. Import licenses are required for the following items, irrespective of origin: (1) rice and air-conditioning machines not exceeding 9,000 kcal/h (excluding air-conditioning ma- chines for motor vehicles); and (2) all goods originating in or consigned from Albania, the German Democratic Republic, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Mon- golia, and Viet Nam. License applications for goods under the second category are subject to a surcharge of 0.5 percent of the c . i . f. value of imports, payable to the Government. 454 Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles may be made freely. There are no restrictions on the amount of foreign exchange made available for travel abroad. Remittances to nonres- idents of dividends, interest, and profits may be made freely. Resident and nonresident travelers may take out any amount in foreign or Singapore bank notes. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of certain textiles and garments of Singapore origin to countries of the European Commun i ty, Austria, Canada, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and the United States are subject to quantitative restriction in the importing countries. Export licenses are required for granite, sand, timber, and rubber. Export proceeds need not be surrendered and may be disposed of freely. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles need not be surren- dered and may be disposed of freely. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount in foreign bank notes and coin, including Singapore gold coin. Capital There are no restrictions on capital transfers. Govern- ment approval is required for investment in residential and other properties (including vacant land) other than those zoned or approved for industrial or commercial use. A foreigner may, however, freely purchase a residential unit within a building of six or more stories and in an approved condominium development without such approval. With regard to other residential proper- ties, foreigners who make an economic contribution to Singapore will be given favorable consideration for purchase of these properties for their own occupation and, in the case of foreign companies, for the accommo- dation of their senior personnel. Banks in Singapore may freely accept deposits in foreign currencies. Financial institutions that have been approved to operate Asian Currency Units (ACUs) in Singapore are able to offer better rates for foreign currency deposits placed with their ACUs because of the absence of m in imum cash reserve and liquidity require- ments. An ACU is a separate accounting entity of a financial institution, which enjoys a concessional rate of tax of 10 percent on its income; it is prohibited from transacting in Singapore dollars. All income earned from offshore loan syndications in Singapore is exempt from tax for ten years under the tax holiday scheme for syndicated offshore loans which came into effect in May 1983. Under the scheme, income earned by ACUs in Singapore would be exempt from tax, provided that: (a) the entity serving as lead manager is an ACU in Singapore (in the case of two or more lead managers, at least one half of the number must ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution be financial institutions in Singapore); (b) the syndica- tion work is carried out substantially in Singapore; (c) there are at least three parties participating in the syndicate; and (d) the facility is syndicated for a party outside Singapore. The scheme has been extended since April 1984 to cover the syndication of other credit facilities such as guarantees, performance bonds, letters of credit, and underwriting facilities. Income earned by nonresidents on funds placed by them with approved fund managers (which are ACUs) in Singapore for investment in offshore markets is exempt from tax under the tax exemption scheme for offshore fund management, which came into effect in May 1983. Management fees of the fund managers are taxed at the concessional rate of 10 percent. Gold There is a free gold market in Singapore. Both resident and nonresident individuals and companies are SINGAPORE permitted to import, hold, negotiate, and export gold freely; imports and exports require neither exchange control approval nor import or export licenses, and gold can be dealt with freely by any person in Singapore. There are two distinct gold markets —the physical market and the futures market. With the exception of some delivery of physical gold in Singapore and Zurich, the main delivery point for the physical market is London; appropriate adjustments are made for the cost of transportation and insurance. Changes During 1985 Capital May 10. The tax exemption period for income earned from offshore loan syndication in Singapore was lengthened from five to ten years, and the five-year limit on tax exemption for income earned from fund manage- ment was abolished. 455 ©International Monetary Fund.

The exchange rate for the Solomon Islands dollar is determined on the basis of a relationship between the Solomon Islands dollar and a trade-weighted basket of the currencies of Solomon Islands' four major trading partners. The Central Bank may make discretion- ary adjustments in the exchange value of the Solomon Islands dollar, up to a total of 2 percent during any four- week period. Daily quotations for the four currencies in the basket (the pound sterling, the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar, and the U .S. dollar), as well as for the deutsche mark and the SDR, are provided by the Central Bank, which also sets limits on the buy ing and selling rates of commercial banks for the U .S. dollar. On December 31, 1985 the buy ing and selling rates quoted by the banks in their dealings with the public were US$0.6220 and US$0.6182, respectively, per SI$1. The commercial banks in Solomon Islands are free to determine their exchange rates for all other foreign currencies. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Solomon Islands formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund's Articles of Agreement on July 24, 1979. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Central Bank by means of the Exchange Control (Foreign Exchange) Regulations, which came into force on March 1, 1977. The Central Bank delegates extensive powers to com- mercial banks, which have been appointed authorized dealers in foreign exchange. The authorized dealers may approve certain types of application for exchange control approval up to specified limits. All persons residing in Solomon Islands are regarded as permanent residents for exchange control purposes, unless they have been granted temporary resident status by an authorized dealer or by the Central Bank. Applications for temporary resident status are normally approved if the person is a citizen of a foreign country who intends to reside in Solomon Islands for a period of less than four years or has resided in Solomon Islands for over four years but who can produce evidence of firm intention to resume permanent residence overseas in the near fu ture. Ownership of real property (other than dwellings for own occupation) or a business indicates permanent residential status, regardless of the duration of residence in Solomon Islands. However, temporary resident status does not release a person from the obligation to comply with all provisions of the exchange control regulations. 456 Prescription of Currency Contractual commitments to persons resident outside Solomon Islands that are expressed in a foreign currency may only be met by payments in that foreign currency. Export proceeds may be received in any foreign currency or in Solomon Islands dollars from an account of an overseas bank w i th a bank in Solomon Islands. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents may open nonresident accounts in Sol- omon Islands dollars with authorized dealers, but ap- proval from the Central Bank or authorized dealers is required for the crediting of these accounts. Balances on such accounts may be transferred abroad with the approval of the Central Bank or authorized dealers. Imports and Import Payments No restrictions are placed on payments for imports, provided that it can be shown that they are properly due overseas. Authorized dealers are permitted to approve most transactions without reference to the Central Bank. Payments for Invisibles Approval is readily given for payments for services and remittances of dividends, profits, and other earnings accruing to overseas residents from companies in Sol- omon Islands, provided that it can be shown that they are properly due overseas. Permanent residents are per- mitted to purchase foreign exchange for payment of all types of invisibles if supporting documents are provided. Transfers by postal order to persons residing perma- nently outside Solomon Islands are permitted, provided that the total amount transferred does not exceed SI$100 a week. Approval is normally given for the purchase of foreign currency for travel purposes. Applications for travel funds must be lodged with an authorized dealer, and applicants are required to present their passports and passage or flight tickets. Requests for unusually large amounts of foreign exchange are referred to the Central Bank. Travelers may not take out Solomon Islands currency notes and coin, in excess of SI$250, without the approval of the Central Bank, which is not normally given. Exports and Export Proceeds Residents may export goods w i thout exchange control formality, provided that they comply w i th the terms of the General Authority issued by the Central Bank. The essential conditions of this General Authority are that payment for goods exported is received within six months before or after the date of export, that the export price is reasonable, and that the proceeds are sold to an authorized dealer. Where exporters are not in a position to comply with the conditions of the General Authority, they must apply to the Central Bank for a Specific ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Au thor i ty. Authority is not needed for goods under SI$250 in value in any one consignment or for certain exempted categories of goods, including most kinds of personal effects of passengers. Proceeds from Invisibles Approval is required for the disposal of foreign currency proceeds other than by means of a sale to an authorized dealer. Overseas residents visiting Solomon Islands may bring in any amount of currency for travel expenditure. Capital All outward transfers of capital require exchange control approval. All applications for transfers must be referred to the Central Bank. Approval is readily given for the withdrawal of nonresident-owned investment capital, repayment of overseas borrowings, and the remittance of temporary residents' and emigrants' fund s. New investment abroad by permanent residents or by companies and other organizations operating in Solomon Islands is subject to certain limitations. Direct invest- ment overseas is permitted when it is likely to be of benefit to Solomon Islands. In the case of portfolio investments, the approval of the Central Bank is needed prior to the acquisition or disposal of foreign securities SOLOMON ISLANDS by a permanent resident. Approval is normally not given for the acquisition of overseas portfolio investments. Restrictions are not normally imposed on the disposal of foreign securities acquired prior to March 1, 1977. Approval by the Central Bank is required for a resident to borrow funds from or to issue equ i ty capital to a nonresident. The Solomon Islands branch of a com- pany or firm incorporated overseas requires approval by the Central Bank before it may borrow funds from a nonresident, including the branch's overseas head office. Where initial or increased foreign investment is con- cerned, the Foreign Investment Board in the Prime Minister's Office must also give its approval. Gold Solomon Islanders alone are granted a license to pan for alluvial gold. Commercial banks and all other residents are required to obtain a permit issued by the Ministry of Na tural Resources to m ine, buy, or export gold. The Central Bank is authorized to b u y, sell, and hold gold but has not yet undertaken any such transactions. Changes During 1985 No s ign if icant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 457 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SOMALIA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Somalia is the Somali Shilling. Somalia's exchange arrangement consists of two ex- change markets, the official market and the free market. In the official market, the exchange rate is adjusted periodically by the Central Bank largely on the basis of relative price movements in Somalia and abroad. On De- cember 31, 1985 the official buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, were, respec- tively, So. Sh. 42.0750 = US$1 and So. Sh. 42.9250 = US$1. The Central Bank of Somalia carries out transac- tions in certain other "convertible" currencies,1 taking into account rates in European exchange markets. The official exchange market in Somalia comprises the Central Bank and the sole commercial bank operating as the authorized dealer of the Central Bank in respect of transactions in foreign currencies. On the receipt side, the official rate applies to the surrendered portion of export proceeds, official loans, grants and investment income, and foreign exchange receipts of embassies and international organizations other than organizations be- longing to the United Nations; and on the payment side, it applies to central government imports, official travel, expenses of Somali embassies abroad, official imports of crude petroleum and petroleum products, and the opera- tional costs of the Central Bank. All other transactions are conducted in the free market. Exchange transactions in the free market take place through U .S. dollar- denominated, external export-promoting, and import accounts. The commercial bank, operating on account of the Central Bank or on its own account, may also operate in the free market at its posted rate, which in principle is defined as the weighted average exchange rate for transactions through foreign currency accounts during the previous business day. On December 31, 1985 the posted buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were So. Sh. 83.6094 = US$1 and So. Sh. 85.2480 = US$1, respectively, having remained at these levels since April 1985. The commercial bank does not conduct forward exchange transactions on behalf of the public, although this is not prohibited. Administration of Control The Ministry of Commerce is the principal govern- ment agency concerned with the implementation and operation of trade controls. Exchange controls are administered by the Central Bank. Prescription of Currency Settlements with the U .S .S .R. are made through bilateral clearing accounts denominated in pounds ster- 1 Deutsche mark, Djibouti francs, French francs, Italian lire, Kuwa i ti dinars, pounds sterling, Saudi Arabian riyals, Swiss francs, and U .A .E. dirhams. 458 ling. Settlements w i th all other countries must be made in Somali shillings or in "convertible" currencies (in- cluding the U .S. dollar, see footnote 1); however, residents are not permitted to make settlements with Israel or South Africa. Nonresident and Foreign Currency Accounts Nonresident accounts in foreign currency may be opened with the authorized exchange dealer by foreign embassies and international institutions. External ac- counts in U .S. dollars may be opened by both residents and nonresidents. Such accounts may be credited with foreign exchange transferred from abroad and may be debited for any external payment and for transfers to other external accounts. Exporters of goods and services may deposit up to 65 percent of their foreign exchange proceeds from exports in export-promotion accounts. Funds in such accounts may be used for merchandise import payments, invisible payments within existing regulations, or be deposited in an import account. Import accounts in foreign exchange may be opened by both residents and nonresidents and credited from export-promotion ac- counts, external accounts, or from transfers of foreign exchange from abroad. Foreign exchange in these accounts may be used for merchandise import payments, invisible payments within existing regulations, or for transfers into other import accounts. Imports and Import Payments Imports of goods originating in or shipped from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Imports of alcohol, tobacco, and tobacco products, crude oil and petroleum products, medical and pharmaceutical products, explo- sives, precious metals and jewelry, and minerals are subject to prior approval. All other items, with the exception of items prohibited for reasons of public safety and social policy, can be imported freely. The state- trading organization, the National Agency for Trade (ENC), is responsible for the import and distribution of certain commodities received under aid programs. The Iraqi-Somali Oil Refinery is responsible for the import of crude petroleum, while the National Petroleum Agency is responsible for imports of other fuels and fuel products. Importation and distribution of petroleum products by capable entrepreneurs in the private sector are permitted. Private importers may open letters of credit for imports at the commercial bank on the basis of foreign exchange made available for that purpose through a foreign currency account w i th the commercial bank; in such a case the foreign exchange involved is kept in a suspense account until the time of settlement of the letter of credit. Alternatively, the commercial bank may sell foreign exchange to private importers at the prevailing ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution market rate. A noninterest-bearing advance deposit up to 100 percent of value may be required to open letters of credit for private sector imports; the deposit is retained up to the settlement date of the letter of credit. Payments for Invisibles Payments to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Payments for current invisibles through export- promotion and import accounts, as well as through the commercial bank selling foreign exchange on its own account, are subject to licensing to prevent unauthorized capital movements. There are no controls on invisible payments if they are made with foreign exchange through an external account. Transfer of salaries, wages, gratuities, and allowances paid in Somalia to foreign personnel by enterprises registered under the Foreign Investment Law are allowed up to 50 percent. Transfers for education are allowed within the limit of US$1,500 per student per year. A traveler is automatically entitled to an allowance of US$200 per trip. In addition, depending on availability of foreign exchange, a traveler is entitled to an allowance of up to US$50 per traveling day with a maximum of US$1,000 per trip, depending on the purpose of travel. The Central Bank considers applications for larger allowances or other invisibles on the basis of documentation and processes such applica- tions within one week after submission. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports and re-exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Bananas are exported only by SOMALFRUIT (previously the National Banana Board). The export of various types of ivory, hides and skins, and minerals is subject to prior approval. All export proceeds must be repatriated. Exporters may retain up to 65 percent of their foreign exchange receipts in export-promotion accounts and must surren- der the remainder to the Central Bank or to the authorized dealer w i th in five business days after their receipt. For exports other than those made under letter of credit arrangements, an advance payment deposit of 30 percent of the value of exports is required. A tax of 25 percent is levied on exports of livestock, on the basis of minimum export prices used for purposes of duty collection. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles are subject to repatriation and declaration. Exporters of services may retain up to 65 percent of their foreign exchange receipts in export- promotion accounts; they must surrender the remainder to the Central Bank or to the authorized dealer w i th in five business days after their receipt. Nonresidents may freely bring in with them any amount in foreign exchange and up to So. Sh. 200 in Somali bank notes and coins; they must make a currency declaration when entering the country. Resident travelers may bring in up to So. Sh. 200 in Somali bank notes and coin and are obliged, upon arrival, to declare any foreign SOMALIA exchange they bring in and to deposit it in external accounts or sell it to the commercial bank at the prevailing market rate w i th in five days. Capital Capital transactions are subject to licensing unless they are authorized by the Foreign Investment Law of February 1960, as amended in January 1977. In accor- dance with the provisions of that law, foreign enterprises must be registered w i th the Directorate of Planning and Coordination. For "productive" enterprises (as defined in the Foreign Investment Law ), profits may be transferred abroad freely up to an annual limit of 30 percent of invested capital; unused portions of transfer rights can be cumulated for three years; and should the profit in any one year be less than 30 percent, the transfer right for the succeeding three years is increased correspondingly. The capital itself may be transferred abroad beginning five years after the date of registration. Profits resulting from other foreign investments may be transferred abroad up to a limit of 10 percent a year of the capital invested, and the capital itself may be transferred abroad over a m in imum period of three years, beginning seven years after the date of registration. The Ministry of Finance, upon the recommendation of other ministries concerned, may extend total or partial exemption from import and export taxes, excise du ty, income tax, and mun ic ipal tax to any enterprise for a period not exceeding five years. Enterprises registered in or after March 1968 mus t, to the largest possible extent, employ residents, and each enterprise must submit to the Committee on Foreign Investments a program for the substitution of nonresidents by resident employees. Gold Residents may hold and acquire in Somalia, for num isma t ic purposes on ly, gold coins that are not legal tender in any country. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewe l ry, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require the permission of the Central Bank; such permis- sion is not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. Gold imported by jewelers must be melted down w i th in one month to a fineness of not more than 22 karats. Imports of gold are exempt from customs du ty when originating in EC countries; imports from elsewhere are subject to a 10 percent du ty. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement January I. The exchange premium of So. Sh. 5 per US$1 above the official exchange rate, in effect since January 1, 1983 for inward remittances by emigrant workers and capital inf low effected by Somali nationals, was abolished. 459 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SOMALIA January 1. A dual exchange rate system was in- troduced involving an official market in which the exchange rate was set by the Central Bank on the basis of a set of indicators and a free market where the exchange rate would float freely. At the same time, the official rate was adjusted from So. Sh. 26 = US$1 to So. Sh. 36 = US$1, representing a devaluation of 27.8 percent. February 1-June 30. The official rate of the Somali shilling was adjusted in a series of steps during the five- month period from So. Sh. 36.000 = US$1 to So. Sh. 40.6083 = US$1, representing a devaluation of 11.35 percent. November 2. The official rate of the Somali shilling was adjusted from So. Sh. 40.6083 = US$1 to So.

Nonresident and Foreign Currency Accounts January 1. A facility was introduced permitting exporters to retain up to 65 percent of foreign exchange proceeds in export-promotion accounts at the commer- cial bank; drawings on such accounts could be used for specified purposes, including import payments and de- posits into import accounts. The latter accounts, which were simultaneously introduced, could be opened in foreign exchange by residents and nonresidents with funds from export-promotion accounts, external ac- counts, or transfers from abroad; drawings on such accounts could be used to finance authorized visible and invisible imports or transfers to other import accounts. In addition, regulations on use of funds in external accounts were liberalized. Imports and Import Payments January 1. Import restrictions were eliminated, with the exception of imports of specified items that were prohibited or made subject to prior approval. January 1. The franco valuta import system, under which Somalis could finance imports with foreign exchange held abroad, was abolished, and a regulation was introduced requiring importers to process import documents through the domestic banking system. In this connection, deposits in the newly established export- promotion and import accounts, as well as in the pre- existing external accounts, were allowed to be used for import payments. November 24. Authorization was granted for capable entrepreneurs in the private sector to import and distrib- ute petroleum products. Payments for Invisibles January 1. The limits on foreign exchange allowance for travel and other purposes were raised. Exports and Export Proceeds January 1. Existing controls on exports, including licensing requirements, were abolished, with the excep- tion of specified items that were made subject to prior approval. In addition, authorization was granted for exporters to retain up to 65 percent of their foreign exchange proceeds in export-promotion accounts. Proceeds from Invisibles January 1. Authorization was granted for exporters of services to retain up to 65 percent of their foreign exchange proceeds in export-promotion accounts. 460 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SOUTH AFRICA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of South Africa is the South African Rand. The authorities of South Africa do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions but intervene in the exchange market to affect the rates quoted by the commercial banks for the "commercial" rand. The principal intervention currency is the U .S. dollar. On December 31, 1985 the commercial banks' spot rates for the U .S. dollar in transactions with the public were US$0.3915 buying and US$0.3905 selling, per R 1. Subject to certain limitations, authorized dealers are permitted to conduct forward exchange operations, including cover for transactions by nonresidents, on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The Reserve Bank provides forward cover in U .S. dollars only; such cover is given to authorized dealers for maturities not exceed- ing 12 months at a time in the form of rand-U.S. dollar swap transactions with a margin based on an interest rate differential between the U .S. dollar and the rand. The Reserve Bank also provides forward cover contracts in U .S. dollars for longer maturities for governmental and other public sector institutions, such as public corpora- tions. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Abolished on February 7, 1983 and reintroduced on September 2, 1985 (without the participation of Swazi- land), the freely floating "financial" rand derives from the local sale and redemption proceeds of South African securities and other investments in South Africa owned by nonresidents (other than former residents of South Africa), capital remittances by emigrants and immi- grants, and approved outward capital transfers by resi- dents . The exchange rate for the financial rand is usually at a discount from the commercial rand rate; at the end of 1985, the discount was about 30 percent, and the closing midpoint exchange of the financial rand in terms of the U.S. dollar on December 31 was R 0.2700 = US$1. South Africa formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund 's Articles of Agreement, as of September 15, 1973. Exchange Control Territory There are virtually no exchange or trade restrictions between the Republic of South Africa (defined for exchange control purposes as including South West Africa), Lesotho, and Swaziland, and these form, with the Republic of South Africa, a single exchange control territory: the Rand Monetary Area. Administration of Control Exchange licensing is the responsibility of the Trea- sury, wh ich has delegated this authority to the South African Reserve Bank; in turn, the Reserve Bank has delegated much of its licensing powers to the authorized dealers. Import and export permits are issued by the Director of Import and Export Control acting on behalf of the Minister of Trade and Indus t ry. Exchange for licensed imports is made available by the authorized dealers upon proof of shipment or, where advance payment is proposed, upon presentation of other docu- mentary evidence, which must include the prior approval of the Reserve Bank. * Prescription of Currency All countries outside the Rand Monetary Area consti- tute the Nonresident Area. The only settlement currency accepted in all countries in the Rand Monetary Area is the rand .2 Settlements by residents of the Rand Monetary Area with the Nonresident Area may be made in rand to and from a Nonresident Account and in any specified currency3 and, for outgoing payments only, in any foreign currency .4 Nonresident Accounts The rand accounts of persons resident outside the Rand Monetary Area are divided into Nonresident Accounts, Financial Rand Accounts, and Blocked Accounts. Nonresident Accounts are held by persons, firms, or companies (including banks) resident, domiciled, or registered outside the Rand Monetary Area. They may be credited with all authorized payments by South African residents, with the proceeds of sales to autho- rized dealers in South Africa of specified currency, and with payments from other Nonresident Accounts in South Africa. They may be debited for payments to Rand Monetary Area residents for any purpose; for payments to nonresidents for any purpose, that is, by transfer to a local Nonresident Account, or for remittance to any country outside the Rand Monetary Area; for the cost of purchases of any foreign currency; and for payments to the account holder while temporarily resident in South Afr ica for short periods. Financial Rand Accounts are the accounts of nonresi- dents of the Rand Monetary Area, other than emigrants 'Au thor ized dealers can permit, w i thout Reserve Bank approval, advance payment of up to 33'/3 percent of the ex-factory cost of capital goods, if such is the requirement of suppliers. 2L i langeni bank notes issued by Swaziland are free ly convertible into rand, at par, w i thout restriction at the Central Bank of Swaz i land, but they are not legal tender in South Afr ica.

Not for Redistribution SOUTH AFRICA from that Area, to which exchange control restrictions have been applied. Such accounts are maintained with authorized banks. They must be credited with the local sale and redemption proceeds of South African securities and other investments in South Africa owned by nonresi- dents, excluding former residents of South Africa. Immigrants arriving after September 1, 1985 may, during the first three years of their residence, introduce their capital through the medium of the financial rand. Dealers on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange are per- mitted to quote prices for financial rand, and its members are permitted to buy and sell financial rand as agents, acting on behalf of nonresidents. Authorized banks are freely permitted to transfer financial rand balances from one Financial Rand Account on their books to another, on their own books, or on the books of another authorized bank. Funds in these accounts may be used freely for reinvestment in locally quoted securities (which may be exported and sold abroad) or for acquiring quoted central government, municipal, or public utility stocks. On application and approval, financial rand may be used by nonresidents for invest- ment in the equity capital of unquoted industrial con- cerns. The maturity proceeds of holdings of five-year nonresident bonds and seven-year, 6 percent Securities Rand Bonds, previously issued by the Treasury, can be remitted abroad in foreign currency. The local sale proceeds of South African securities held by immigrants prior to their arrival in South Africa, or acquired abroad within three years of their arrival, are also credited to Financial Rand Accounts, with the exception of assets of persons who previously had been South African residents. Blocked Accounts are the accounts of emigrants from the Rand Monetary Area to which exchange control restrictions have been applied. They must be credited with any cash held at the time of departure and with the proceeds of any other South African asset held at the time of departure and subsequently sold. Such funds may not be transferred from South Africa or to another Blocked Account in South Africa, but may be retained on deposit with an authorized dealer, used within certain limits for the holder's living expenses while visiting South Africa, or for other specified payments to resi- dents, or be invested in any securities that are quoted locally; such securities may not, however, be exported and sold abroad. Special Restricted Accounts are the accounts of non- residents to which restrictions specifically relating to the debt standstill arrangements have been applied. Imports and Import Payments All importers requiring import permits for those commodities still subject to import control must be registered with the Director of Import and Export Control. The permits are valid for imports from any country. Imports free of permit include all goods imported from Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe that were grown, produced, or manufac- 462 tured in those countries, with the exception of sugar from Swaziland and tea from Malawi and Zimbabwe. Since July 1, 1985 the restrictive list of freely impor- table goods has been abolished, and the present import control regulations contain only a schedule of com- modities still subject to import control. An importer is automatically granted exchange to pay for current imports upon presenting to his bank the necessary consignment documents (proof of importation) and an import permit where required. Payments prior to the date of shipment or dispatch are not normally allowed, except with prior approval or special authoriza- tion by the Reserve Bank (see footnote 1). With certain exceptions, imports are subject to a general sales tax of 12 percent, as are locally produced goods. Payments for Invisibles Authority is delegated to the authorized dealers to approve certain current payments for invisibles without limitation and for others up to established limits. Applications for amounts in excess of these limits are considered on their merits by the Reserve Bank. For current income payments, such as declared dividends, profits, royalties, etc., that accrue in South Africa, approval is given by the authorized dealers without reference to the Reserve Bank, provided that the relative royalty agreement was approved by the Department of Trade and Industry and the Reserve Bank, and provided the remittance of profits and dividends is based on profits and dividends earned after January 1, 1984 and does not involve the use of local credit facilities. Favorable consideration is, however, given by the Reserve Bank to such transfers where the use of local credit facilities is not regarded as excessive. Income derived from securi- ties acquired with blocked funds or otherwise held by nonresidents is freely transferable to the owner's country of residence. Limited amounts of exchange to pay for membership fees, family maintenance, etc., are authorized. The basic allowance for tourist travel in a year is R 6,000 for an adult and R 3,000 for a child under 12 years. Separately, there is an annual basic exchange allocation of R 2,000 for an adult (R 1,000 for a child under 12) for travel to Angola, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Zaire, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and the Indian Ocean Islands. In addition to the tourist allowances, authorized dealers may grant allowances for business trips overseas at a rate not exceeding R 500 a day, with a maximum of R 10,000 in a calendar year. The separate applicable allowance for business trips to the neigh- boring territories mentioned above is R 4,000 a year, at a rate not exceeding R 400 a day. Residents leaving South Africa for destinations out- side the Rand Monetary Area may take the fu ll applica- ble allowance in foreign bank notes. The amount of South African Reserve Bank notes, however, may not exceed R 200, but these are not regarded as being part of the basic travel allowance. Foreign visitors leaving South Africa may take with them up to R 200 in Reserve ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Bank notes and any amount of foreign notes which they brought into the country or obtained from the disposal of instruments of exchange that they brought to and exchanged in South Africa. These limitations on the export of Reserve Bank notes do not apply in the case of contract workers returning to neighboring countries, who are permitted to take w i th them reasonable amounts in bank notes. There are no limitations on the export of domestic currency to Lesotho and Swaziland. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of specified commodities considered as being in relatively short supply or controlled for strategic reasons require export permits for their sales to buyers outside the United Kingdom, any Commonwealth coun- try, any British colony, protectorate, or trust territory, and the United States. Unless otherwise permitted, all export proceeds must be remitted to South Africa and surrendered within six months from the date of shipment or seven days from the date of accrual. To ensure a more effective application of exchange control procedures regarding the repatriation of export proceeds, exporters are required to cover forward their export proceeds within seven days of shipment. Exporters may grant credit up to 12 months, provided the credit is necessary in the particular trade or needed to protect an existing export market or to capture a new export market. Beginning from April 1, 1985, voluntary restraint is applied on exports of certain steel products to the United States; retroactively from October 1, 1984, the voluntary restraint has been formalized in the form of a five-year agreement on restraint on exports of certain types of steel from South Africa to the United States. The quotas for the various categories of South African steel products during the agreement period are to be determined annually and adjusted periodically on the basis of the projected consumption of these categories in the United States during a specified control period. At the request of the United States, a bilateral export restraint agreement has been concluded to restrain South African exports of textiles to the United States. Accord- ing ly, as from September 1, 1985, the export of certain textile products and clothing to the United States has been placed under export control. The control measures will remain in force for three consecutive calendar years ending August 31, 1988. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles must be surrendered w i th in seven days from the date of accrual, unless exemption is obtained. Upon entry from countries outside the Rand Monetary Area, residents and nonresidents may bring in R 200 in South African Reserve Bank notes. There are no limitations on the import of domestic currency from Lesotho and Swaziland. SOUTH AFRICA Capital5 All inward loan transfers require specific approval,6 while inward transfers for investment in equity capital are freely permitted. Foreign exchange accruing to residents from capital transfers and transactions must be surrendered. Outward transfers of capital by residents to destinations outside the Rand Monetary Area require the approval of the Reserve Bank. Local borrowing by nonresident-owned or nonresident-controlled firms is subject to limitation. Transfers by residents for the purchase of South African (or other) shares on foreign stock exchanges are generally not permitted (except in amounts not exceeding R 2,000 for each shareholder, to allow South African residents to exercise rights arising from existing holdings of shares in foreign companies quoted only on foreign stock exchanges), although South African stockbrokers may engage in arbitrage transac- tions in securities, subject to certain conditions designed to prevent any net outflow of exchange. Applications by South African residents to retain in, or transfer to, countries outside the Rand Monetary Area funds for bona fide long-term investment in specific development projects or for the expansion of existing projects that are owned or controlled by South Africans are considered by the Reserve Bank and the Treasury on their merits. Investments designed to foster exports and to maintain or expand markets abroad are normally viewed favorably. Immigrants are required to furnish the exchange control authorities w i th a complete return of their foreign assets and liabilities at the time of their arrival. Any foreign assets transferred to South Africa may, through the same channel, be retransferred abroad within the first three years after arrival. The proceeds of the sale of quoted or unquoted South African securities, real estate, and other equity invest- ments by nonresidents of South Africa to residents must be credited to Financial Rand Accounts and are accord- ingly transferable through this medium. Emigrant families are entitled to the normal travel allowance at the rate for commercial rand and are permitted to remit up to R 100,000 (R 50,000 for single persons) through the medium of Financial Rand. Any balance exceeding the permissible transferable amount must be credited to a Blocked Account. The total net income earned from an emigrant's blocked assets may be transferred. An emigrant family or an individual can 5For exchange control purposes, a nonresident is defined as a person whose normal place of residence or domicile is outside the Rand Monetary Area.

The terms "scrip" and "share certificates" inc lude any temporary or substitute documents of title, such as letters of allotment, option certificates, balance receipts, and any other receipts for scrip. 6Approval is generally given for borrowing abroad w i th a maturity of at least six mon ths by domestic entrepreneurs, except for speculation or consumer credit. Authorized dealers generally are permitted to raise funds abroad in their own names for the financing of South African foreign trade and other approved purposes. 463 ©International Monetary Fund.

Favorable consideration is given for the transfer by nonresident-owned branches and subsidiaries of open or approved loan account balances, of current profits earned after January 1, 1984, and dividends declared on profits from trading generated after January 1, 1984, provided that the remittance does not involve the excessive use of local credit facilities. The physical export from South Africa of nonresident-owned securities is permitted, except by emigrants on their departure. Gold Residents of South Africa may purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in South Africa for numismatic and investment purposes. With this exception, residents of South Africa other than the monetary authorities, autho- rized dealers, registered gold producers, and authorized industrial and professional users are not allowed to purchase, hold, or sell gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. All exports of gold require the prior approval of the Reserve Bank; the approval authority has been delegated to authorized dealers in respect of exports of jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler (subject to a written declaration to the effect that the jewelry will be brought back to South Africa on the traveler's return) and in respect of exports of gold jewelry by manufacturing jewelers (except for exports to Botswana, Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe), subject to a written declaration that the articles are in fu l ly manufactured form and that the gold content of each does not exceed 80 percent of the selling price to the ultimate consignee. Furthermore, after reference and approval by the Reserve Bank, residents are allowed to export currency coins, including certain gold coins, for sale to numismatists. The gold mining industry must sell its output to the Reserve Bank within one month of production. The arrangement whereby the Reserve Bank paid the gold mines in U .S. dollars for 50 percent of their total sales, with the balance settled in rand, was cancelled with effect from December 9, 1985. From this date the mines are paid in rand only. As a special concession, the industry may retain approximately one third of its production for the minting of gold coins and kilo bars. The Mint from time to time strikes gold coins and the Krugerrand without a face value, which are legal tender but do not circulate in South Africa; these are made available in limited numbers to resident collectors, while the bulk is sold abroad. 464 Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement August 27. Trading on the South African currency market was suspended; the market was re-opened on September 2, 1985. September 1. It was announced that the financial rand market was reintroduced, thereby reintroducing a dual exchange market. from Imports and Import Payments March 25. General sales tax was increased 10 percent to 12 percent. September 23. A 10 percent import surcharge on all imports not "bound" by GATT rules was imposed. The measure affected about 55 percent of annual imports. October 4. The standstill arrangement introduced in respect of debt repayments was also applied to payments for imports and services received prior to January 1, 1985. Payments for Invisibles September 30. Restrictions were imposed on outward remittances of profits by local companies, including a regulation that dividends paid to nonresidents could be declared only from profits earned since January 1, 1984. Exports and Export Proceeds September 1. Under a bilateral export restraint agree- ment with the United States, exports of certain textile products and clothing items to the United States were placed under export control, to remain in force for three consecutive calendar years ending on August 31, 1988. Capital September I. A standstill arrangement for a period of four months was introduced in respect of certain debt repayments. (On January 1, 1986 the standstill ar- rangement was extended for another three-month period.) Any resident wishing to discharge a debt may only do so by credit of the amount to a special restricted account. Gold January 1. The premiums on Krugerrand sold by the company "Intergold" to local distributors were reduced. January 29. In light of the considered abnormal conditions in the foreign exchange market, it was decided that, as an interim measure, the Reserve Bank would pay the gold mines in U.S. dollars for only 50 percent of their sales; the rest would be settled in rand. December 9. A regulation was introduced requiring payments to gold mines for gold purchases to be effected in rand and not partly in U .S. dollars as previously arranged. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SPAIN (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Spain is the Spanish Peseta. The authorities of Spain do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions; exchange rates are determined largely on the basis of demand and supply conditions in the foreign exchange markets. However, the authorities intervene when necessary in order to smooth out fluctua- tions in exchange rates and to maintain orderly condi- tions in the exchange market. Following its routine monitoring of foreign exchange market developments in the course of the morning, the Bank of Spain meets each working day around noon in an official session with the commercial banks, at which the latter trade freely in foreign exchange among themselves. The average ex- change rate in these transactions is published by the Bank of Spain for specified currencies,1 and is the official exchange rate used by the banks in their transactions with the public during the following day, within a margin of ±0 .125 percent set by the Bank of Spain. In addition, each week the Bank of Spain quotes buy ing and selling rates for bank notes in specified currencies for its own operations. Authorized banks are allowed to operate in foreign markets for spot and forward transactions related to most current transactions, as well as to amortization of financial credits. Forward cover may be provided to residents for all permitted foreign exchange receipts and for import payments. Forward contracts may not exceed 12 months, and forward purchases and sales of exchange are restricted to currencies admitted to the Madrid foreign exchange market and the ECU. The terms of the forward contract must coincide w i th the terms of the commercial transactions that are being covered. The forward position of an individual bank at the close of each day must not reflect a net buy ing or selling position in U .S. dollars in excess of US$1 million; in French francs, deutsche mark, Swiss francs, Italian lire, and Japanese yen in excess of US$0.25 million; and in each of the other convertible currencies in excess of US$100,000. In addition, most commercial banks can freely purchase foreign exchange to cover a forward contract six months prior to the maturity of contract. Exchange Control Territory The Peninsular Territories of the Spanish State, the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands, Ceuta, and Melilla constitute a single exchange control territory. Administration of Control The guidelines on foreign exchange policy are for- mulated by an interministerial commission. The Ministry 'Aus t ra l ian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, F inn ish markkaa, French francs, Irish pounds, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and U .S. dollars. of Economy and Finance is in charge of administrative functions connected w i th exchange and trade controls, as well as controls over Spanish investment abroad, private Spanish lending abroad, foreign financing of trade, and the registration of foreign investments in Spain. The Bank of Spain is in charge of operative functions, in particular, the handling of external reserves. It is also responsible for the authorization of short-term and long- term loans in foreign currency to residents for nontrade purposes. Contracts relating to technological matters must be registered w i th the Ministry of Industry and Energy. Prescription of Currency Settlements on account of merchandise transactions and invisibles may be made in any specified currency (see footnote 1), but they are usually made in the currency of the country of origin or destination. There are no bilateral payments arrangements. Nonresident Accounts As from December 1985, accounts affected by the regulations on nonresident accounts are either convert- ible accounts or ordinary accounts. Convertible Peseta Accounts. Convertible Peseta Ac- counts may be credited with the proceeds of foreign currency bank notes only in certain cases in the Spanish foreign currency market, with authorized payments made by residents to nonresidents as a result of any balance of payments transactions, with accrued interest on such accounts, and with transfer from other such accounts. Convertible Peseta Accounts may be debited for purchases of equivalent amounts of foreign currency and bank notes in the Spanish foreign currency market, for authorized payments in pesetas to residents as a result of any balance of payments transactions, for cash drawings by nonresidents, and for transfers to other peseta accounts. Interest on Convertible Peseta Accounts can be freely established by authorized banks, and balances are not subject to reserve requirements. Bal- ances in Convertible Peseta Accounts are eligible for forward cover in the Spanish forward exchange market. Ordinary Nonresident Accounts (Royal Decree 1723/85 and Resolution of December 20, 1985) can be credited freely. Balances in such accounts, which are not convertible, may be utilized to cover tourist expenses in Spain, as well as investments that can qua l ify as for- eign investments; transfer rights for such investments, financed by ordinary pesetas, require the fu l f i l lment of certain conditions (e.g., a three-year maintenance period for the transfer of principal, the external origin of the funds, and verification in the General Directorate). Imports and Import Payments Most imports are admitted under the following ar- rangements: (1) free imports, (2) global quotas, (3) state 465 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SPAIN trad ing, and (4) ind iv idual licensing, also referred to as the "bilateral import regime." All imports require either an import license or an "import declaration" issued by the Directorate-General of Foreign Trade (Ministry of Economy and Finance). Provided that import prices are not considered abnormal, import declarations are issued freely for a large number of goods (mostly foodstuffs not under state trading, raw materials, capital goods, and spare parts, and also some consumer goods) included in an import free list that applies to most countries .2 All other imports require licenses. There are global quotas for specified imports from countries to which the free list applies, but licenses are usua l ly granted for larger amounts; separate global quotas exist for imports of these same commodities from EC countries. W i th certain exceptions, the global quota regime also applies to goods of Japanese origin. The quotas are established in peseta terms every six months by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Imports of specified products from Japan and the state trading countries are subject to the bilateral trade regime. Imports of cotton, certain other agricultural products, tobacco, and petroleum are state traded. Some goods formally listed as being subject to state trading, such as feedgrains and raw cotton, may be freely imported by private traders. Imports of certain agricultural products that are free of quan t i ta t ive restriction and previously were state traded are subject to variable import levies. Import subsidies are paid on certain foodstuffs and specified other essential commodities. Exchange in the appropriate currency to pay for authorized imports is granted freely. Except for capital goods, suppliers' credit for imports is not normally permitted to exceed 90 days. All import transactions must be domiciled with an authorized bank, and the import payment must be made through the bank of domiciliation; exempt from domiciliation are transac- tions valued at less than Ptas 0.5 m i l l ion, provided that payment is to be made w i th in one year. Payments for Invisibles Banks are authorized to sell foreign exchange freely for listed current invisibles, provided that the request is supported by appropriate documents to verify the authen- ticity of the transaction. Holders of Spanish securities may freely transfer abroad accrued interest, dividends, and proceeds from the disposal of subscription rights. In the case of securities purchased w i th internal pesetas, purchasers must hold them for three years to qua l i fy to transfer abroad the proceeds from the liquidation of such securities. Profits and dividends on direct investments are freely transferable abroad. Rents on nonresident- owned real estate are transferable, provided that the purchase price has been paid in f u l l. A general license permits the reinsurance abroad of risks insured in Spain 2The import free l ist does not apply to A f g h a n i s t a n, A l b a n i a, Andorra, Bhu t an, the People's Repub l ic of C h i n a, the Democratic People's Repub l ic of Korea, the Lao People's Democratic Repub l ic, Mongo l ia, Nepa l, San Mar ino, Tibet, the U . S . S . R ., and V iet N am. 466 w i th Spanish firms or w i th foreign insurance companies operating in Spain. Unless special authorization is otherwise granted, insurance contracts abroad are re- stricted to cover for exports and imports of goods and related operations. Payments up to Ptas 50,000 for any purpose may be made w i thout any supporting documents. For larger payments, declarations to the Directorate-General of External Transactions in the Ministry of Economy and Finance are required. The basic exchange allowance for tourism is Ptas 120,000 a person a journey, with an annual max imum of Ptas 480,000. The authorized banks are free to sell the equivalent of Ptas 300,000 a person for each business trip, w i th an annual max imum of Ptas 2 .1 m i l l ion, and any amount for travel for educa- tion or health care. Travelers may take w i th them Ptas 100,000 in notes of the Bank of Spain. The sale of foreign exchange for amounts in excess of the above limits and for current invisibles not specifically listed requires a prior declaration to the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Proceeds from the liquidation of foreign investments are freely transferable abroad, provided they were not financed from External Accounts in Internal Pesetas. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports are subject to prior licensing by the Directorate-General of Foreign Trade. All export pro- ceeds must be sold in the exchange market or to the Bank of Spain through authorized banks w i th in 15 days of receipt. Certain agricultural products may be subject to an export tax, but this practice is unu sua l. Since April 1980 some goods included in a list published by the Directorate-General of Foreign Trade may be exported without a license if payment is made in convertible foreign currency and within six months of export; in this case, only a declaration before the customs is required. Proceeds from Invisibles All exchange proceeds from invisibles must be sold in the exchange market or to the Bank of Spain through authorized banks w i th in 15 days of receipt. Capital 1. Inward Transfers Beg inn ing from June 1985, all foreign investments in Spain irrespective of the size of companies or the ratio of foreign participation need only to be declared to the Directorate-General of External Transactions for veri- fication and can be taken as approved in the absence of response from the latter w i th in 30 days, with the exception of foreign investment in strategic sectors ( inc lud ing defense, public services, mass media, oil re f in ing and exploration, air and sea transport, m in ing, banking, and insurance) and investments by foreign governments and foreign pub l ic en t i t ies, where prior authorization is required. Portfolio investment in shares is treated as direct investment; purchases of bonds by nonresidents are unrestricted. Proceeds, inc lud ing cap- ital ga ins, from the l iqu ida t ion of such shares may be ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution transferred abroad; however, if the purchase was made with internal pesetas, the owner of the shares must hold them for three years, after wh ich he may transfer the liquidation proceeds abroad. The purchase of bank certificates of deposit by nonresidents requires special authorization, but nonresidents may freely purchase bonds issued by banks w i th a ma tur i ty of five years or more. Foreign investment for the acquisition of branches or real estate is not subject to restrictions, if financed w i th convertible currencies; such investments need only to be declared to the Directorate-General of External Transac- tions for verification and can be taken as approved in the absence of response from the latter w i th in 30 days, w i th the same exceptions as for direct inves tmen ts. Proceeds from the sale of real estate are transferable abroad, provided that they were not financed from External Accounts in Internal Pesetas. Nonbank residents are not allowed to hold foreign currency deposits w i th resident banks, or foreign cur- rency (and peseta) deposits w i th nonresident banks w i thout prior authorization. The granting of loans by nonresidents to residents requires authorization by the Bank of Spain. For loans with an average term to maturity of one year or more, approval is granted automatically if the application is not questioned or rejected w i th in 15 working days by the Bank of Spain. Suppliers' credits extended to residents by nonresidents require authorization by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Certificates of deposit issued by banks can only be purchased by nonresidents subject to authorization; long-term bonds of banks (f ive to ten years) can be purchased freely. 2. Outward Transfers Direct investments abroad by residents are permitted free ly, provided one of the following conditions is met: (a) the share of the Spanish investment is at least 20 percent of the capital of the foreign company; (b) the Spanish investor participates in the management of the foreign company or otherwise exercises an important influence over it; or (c) the foreign company uses exclusively or predominantly technology provided by the Spanish investor. Direct investment projects abroad must be declared to the Directorate-General of External Transactions for verification, and may be taken as accepted if no administrative notification is received w i th in 30 days. Direct investments in foreign companies leading to the purchase and holding of securities and the purchase of real estate are not liberalized. Spanish residents, individuals, or moral nonfinancial persons, may freely buy fixed and floating interest rate bonds and notes issued by Spanish firms and international organiza- tions of which Spain is a member. An investment fund may hold up to 20 percent of its net worth in foreign currency issues; commercial banks, savings banks, and insurance companies may increase their holdings of foreign currency issues every year by an amount equiva- lent to 10 percent of the increase in their own resources SPAIN (capital and reserves). All other portfolio investments abroad require prior authorization. Requests by nonbank residents to grant loans to nonresidents and for suppliers' credits from Spanish residents to nonresidents require authorization by the M in is try of Economy and Finance. Authorization from the Bank of Spain is required for the early repayment of loans denominated in foreign currency. Authorized banks may extend various types of credit to nonresi- dents, provided that th is credit is financed w i th funds deposited in Spain in nonresident convertible currency accounts; some forms of such credit do not require prior approval by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold in any form in Spain. Purchases of gold, silver, and platinum ingots are subject to a luxu ry tax of 30 percent, but gold purchased for industrial use is exempt from the tax. Imports of gold are subject to quotas issued by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Such quotas are granted to industrial users for purposes of manu fac tu r ing jewe lry and other articles. Changes During 1985 Nonresident Accounts August 28. It was announced that w i th effect from January 1, 1986, nonresident accounts denominated in pesetas would be grouped into two categories: Accounts in Convertible Pesetas, and Accounts in Ordinary Pesetas; besides the already existing convertible peseta accounts, the former would include emigrants' accounts and Andorra's pesetas accounts (which would be ter- minated as two separate categories), and the latter would comprise accounts in internal pesetas, tourist accounts, and accounts relating to execution of business contracts. Payments for Invisibles May 24. The basic exchange allowances for tourist and business travel were raised by 50 percent. In addition, the amount of currency notes of the Bank of Spain that travelers could take with them was raised from Ptas 20,000 to Ptas 100,000. Capital April 30. In a substantial change to existing regula- tions, a Royal Decree Law was issued, abolishing the need for special authorization by the Council of Minis- ters for the purchase by resident or nonresident for- eigners of rural property with an area exceeding 4 hectares of irrigated land or 20 hectares of unirrigated land. May 29. In a substantial liberalization of regulations governing foreign direct and portfolio investments, adm in is tra t ive authorization for investments in compa- nies w i th more than 50 percent Spanish ownership was e l im ina ted. Henceforth, all foreign investments need only be declared to the Directorate-General of External Transactions for ver if ica t ion, and could be taken as accepted in the absence of response within 30 days. 467 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SRI LANKA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Sri Lanka is the Sri Lanka Rupee, for which the U .S. dollar is the intervention currency. The exchange rate of the Sri Lanka rupee is adjusted periodically by the Central Bank, taking account of domestic price developments relative to those of Sri Lanka's six major trading partners (France, the Federal Republic of Germany, India, Japan, the United King- dom, and the United States). The Central Bank deter- mines daily the spot buy ing and selling rates of the U .S. dollar against the Sri Lanka rupee for its transac- tions with the commercial banks; it purchases and sells the U .S. dollar on a spot basis at the buy ing and selling rates so established. On December 31, 1985 the buy ing and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were SL Rs 27.4000 and SL Rs 27.4150, respectively, per US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. The Central Bank provides forward cover to commer- cial banks for their sales and purchases in U .S. dollars only; the period of such cover is up to three months. One-month forward dollars are purchased at the spot middle rate and sold at a premium of SL Rs 4.00 per US$100 against the spot middle rate. Three-month forward dollars are purchased and sold at a discount of SL Rs 0.50 at a premium of SL Rs 20.00, respectively, per US$100 against the spot middle rate. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Department of Exchange Control of the Central Bank as agent of the Government. All remittances of foreign exchange in Sri Lanka must normally be made through commercial banks authorized to carry out operations in foreign currencies in accordance with the exchange control procedures prescribed by the Controller of Exchange. Remittances may also be made through post offices, under permits issued by the Controller of Exchange. The Foreign Investment Advisory Committee handles applications relating to foreign investment in areas other than those coming within the purview of the Greater Colombo Economic Commission (GCEC), which ad- ministers the Investment Promotion Zone. Prescription of Currency Payments to, and receipts from, member countries of the Asian Clearing Union (i.e., Bangladesh, Burma, India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Nepal, and Pakistan) in respect of current transactions must be effected in Asian Monetary Units or in the currency of the respec- tive member of the Asian Clearing Union. For settlements with all other countries, payments for imports may be made in any foreign currency or in Sri Lanka rupees. Other payments may be made either in the 468 currency of the country to which the payment is due or by crediting Sri Lanka rupees to an External Rupee Account. Proceeds from exports must be received in designated foreign currencies. * Other receipts may be accepted in Sri Lanka rupees from an External Rupee Account or in any designated foreign currency (see footnote 1). Nonresident Accounts Nonresident accounts in Sri Lanka rupees may be held in any commercial bank in Sri Lanka by (a) nonnationals resident outside Sri Lanka; (b) firms and companies registered outside Sri Lanka; (c) Sri Lanka nationals resident outside Sri Lanka, who are classified for this purpose into two categories (those whose current or savings accounts are redesignated as nonresident ac- counts following their departure, and those whose accounts are opened after their departure); (d) emigrants; and (e) foreign banks. The opening of these accounts for categories (a) and (b), the crediting of the initial and subsequent deposits arising from inward remittances, and debits for local disbursements may be effected without the prior approval of the Department of Ex- change Control; however, local credits to these accounts and debits for remittances abroad require the prior approval of the Department. The opening and redesig- nating of accounts in category (c), credits arising from inward remittances, and local credits and debits to such accounts may be effected w i thout the prior approval of the Department of Exchange Control; debits of these accounts for remittances abroad without exchange con- trol approval are not permitted. Accounts in category (d) are designated in the first instance as nonresident blocked accounts only when instructions to that effect are received from the Department of Exchange Control. Local debits to such accounts may be effected without the prior approval of the Department of Exchange Control; however, local credits to them and debits for outward remittances require the prior approval of the Department. Under category (e) foreign banks may be permitted to open and operate nonresident accounts with a local commercial bank without the prior approval of the Department of Exchange Control. Nonresident blocked accounts are used for holding funds that have not been accepted for transfer abroad, usually funds owned by nonresidents, repatriates, and emigrants. Authorized dealers are permitted to debit these accounts for local disbursements and credit them on account of pensions, income tax re funds, and profits and dividends without prior approval. Funds in blocked accounts may be invested in any local enterprise without 'Aus t ra l ian dollars, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U .S. dollars. ©International Monetary Fund.

Remittances up to a maximum of SL Rs 200,000 are allowed from these accounts without the prior approval of the exchange control authorities. Remittance of interest accrued to blocked accounts is fu l ly transferable after deduction of taxes. Also retained in blocked accounts is a proportion of local currency earnings derived from the exhibition of foreign-owned films; such retained funds may be used by the owner for certain specified purposes, including the making of films in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka nationals resident abroad are allowed to maintain nonresident foreign currency accounts in Sri Lanka in convertible currencies.2 Such accounts can also be opened by Sri Lankans within 90 days of their arrival in Sri Lanka with foreign exchange brought in by them or received from abroad. Credits to the accounts are limited to the proceeds of remittances from abroad and money brought into the country by individuals at the time of arrival; in addition, interest payments in these four convertible currencies may be credited to the accounts. These accounts may be freely debited without exchange control approval for payments abroad or for payments within Sri Lanka (converted to Sri Lanka rupees) while the account holder is outside Sri Lanka, and for a period of ten years from the date of arrival of the account holder for the purpose of taking up perma- nent residence in Sri Lanka. These accounts are exempt from income and wealth taxes during the period in which the account holder is resident abroad and for a further period of ten years after resuming residence in Sri Lanka. Commercial banks operating in Sri Lanka may estab- lish a Foreign Currency Banking Un i t. These units may accept time and demand deposits in any designated foreign currency from nonresidents and from resident enterprises in the Investment Promotion Zone, and they may extend loans and advances in any designated foreign currency to any nonresident and to any resident enter- prise having GCEC status. In addition, the Foreign Currency Banking Units are allowed to accept time and demand deposits from and grant loans and advances to any other resident approved by the Central Bank for such purposes as may be approved by the Central Bank. Imports and Import Payments3 Except for certain specified imports, no prior licensing is required. Imports that are subject to prior licensing include those subject to control for security reasons, precious metals, alcohol, apparatus and equipment used 2In deutsche mark, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, and U .S. dollars. 3As part of the set of measures introduced under the 1986 budget, and w i th effect from January 1, 1986, quota restrictions on imports of textiles were abolished, and imports of cotton textiles were made subject to protective customs du ty of 100 percent or SL Rs 25 a square meter (100 percent or SL Rs 40 a square meter for synthetic textiles), whichever was higher.

Imports of specified items4 are restricted to govern- ment or state corporations; these are referred to as "reserved items." Prior approval procedures apply to certain imports of capital goods: certain machinery imports relating to foreign investment require the ap- proval of the Foreign Investment Advisory Committee, and certain machinery imports relating to local invest- ment require the prior approval of the Local Investment Advisory Committee; no prior approval is required if any single consignment does not exceed SL Rs 700,000. Holders of balances in Convertible Rupee Accounts, which were abolished for new credits as of Novem- ber 16, 1977, may use these funds to pay for certain imports, subject to licensing by the Controller of Imports and Exports. Except for specified transactions, imports can be effected only against sight letters of credit. An autho- rized dealer may approve an application to remit foreign exchange or to credit a nonresident account against an application for the opening of a letter of credit, and proof of a valid import license, when applicable. These re- quirements do not apply where the value of a consign- ment is less than SL Rs 5,000 and is for the direct use of the importer. Payments for Invisibles Certain payments for invisibles require exchange control permission. For travel abroad, residents of Sri Lanka are allowed a basic foreign exchange allowance of 2,000 Indian rupees an adult and 1,000 Indian rupees a child under 12 years, once every two years, for travel to the "Indian group of countries" (defined as Bangladesh, Bhu tan, Burma, India, Maldives, Nepal, and Pakistan); the U .S. dollar or pound sterling equivalents of these amounts may be allowed. In addition, basic allowances of £ stg. 500 for an adult and £ stg. 250 for a child under 12 years of age are allowed every four years for travel to other countries. Additional foreign exchange is provided to pay for air fares. The prior approval by the Central Bank is not required for these sales of exchange, as the function has been delegated to the banks. Allowances for official travel require a certificate from the head of the relevant institution. Banks can also provide foreign exchange for business travel when the request is accom- panied by a letter from the chairman, director, partner, or sole proprietor of the company recommending the particular trip abroad, and with confirmation that the cost 4These include dates, ch i l ies, onions, potatoes, certain petroleum products, films, consumer tex t i les, caustic soda, tea chests, ju te hessian, mamoties, and matches. 469 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SRI LANKA of the exchange will be borne by the respective business establishment. In those cases, exchange is allowed at the rate of US$45 a day, up to a maximum of 30 days, for the Indian group of countries and US$90 a day, also up to a maximum of 30 days, for other destinations. These limits apply to chairmen, directors, partners, and sole proprietors of companies; other business executives may obtain up to US$30 a day for the Indian group of countries and up to US$65 a day, up to a maximum of 30 days, for other countries. Foreign exchange may be released for medical treat- ment abroad if any specialist, whether in government service or in private practice, certifies that equally effective treatment is not available in Sri Lanka. In addition, a monthly living allowance may be granted up to the equivalent of £ stg. 130 for an adult and £ stg. 65 for a child under 12 years for the Indian group of countries; the corresponding amounts for other countries are £ stg. 500 and £ stg. 250, respectively. Exchange for emergency travel for persons who have already used the basic allowance may be released without prior approval in amounts up to Indian Rs 750 for the Indian group of countries and £ stg. 200 for other countries. Authorized dealers are also allowed to sell foreign exchange for advertising charges and for subscriptions and payments to international tourist organizations. Payments for other types of travel allowance require prior approval by the Central Bank. The provision of foreign exchange is allowed for education abroad at a recognized university or technical institute to cover passage fare, living expenses, tuition fees, textbooks, etc. For living expenses annual foreign exchange limits are established for (a) undergraduate or professional and technical education, and for (b) postgraduate education, according to four groups of countries. For the group of countries in the Indian subcontinent foreign exchange is made available up to Indian Rs 7,200 and Indian Rs 9,600, respectively, for undergraduate and postgraduate studies; for Europe (including the United Kingdom and the U .S .S .R . ), up to £ stg. 2,400 and £ stg. 3,000, respectively; for Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and the United States, up to US$6,000 and US$7,200, respectively; and for all other countries, up to US$3,600 and US$4,800, respec- tively. A clothing allowance of US$150 (or its equiva- lent in other foreign currency) is allowed once in four years in addition to the above-mentioned amounts. Indian and Pakistani nationals are permitted to remit a maximum of two thirds of their gross monthly income for family maintenance. Foreign technical personnel employed by approved enterprises may remit up to two thirds of their monthly earnings if their contract of employment does not exceed three years, and up to one third when the employment contract exceeds three years. Foreign technical personnel employed in the free trade zone may remit up to 90 percent of their monthly earnings. Nationals of Sri Lanka are not granted foreign exchange for family remittances. 470 Commissions up to 5 percent of the f .o .b ., c & f, or c . i .f. value, as appropriate, are allowed on export orders secured through agents abroad; commissions exceeding 5 percent require specific approval. No remittances for insurance on exports are permitted; these must be covered with the Insurance Corporation of Sri Lanka. Holders of funds in Convertible Rupee Accounts with credit balances outstanding as of November 15, 1977 may use these funds for travel expenditures and other current invisibles without the prior approval of the Controller of Exchange. Banks are authorized, without prior exchange control approval, to provide foreign exchange for subscriptions to professional institutions, fees in respect of foreign examinations held in Sri Lanka, and payments for the import of material for correspondence courses. Profit remittances of nonresident partners of partner- ships in Sri Lanka and remittances of dividends to nonresident shareholders of companies whose financial assets are in rupees may be effected through commercial banks without prior exchange control approval if they relate to the year of application, do not include undis- tributed profits from previous years, and do not include transfers from reserves and profits resulting from the sale of fixed assets.

Resident nonnationals may maintain foreign currency accounts with domestic commercial banks in any of ten designated currencies5 without prior exchange control approval. These accounts must be operated by the domestic unit of the bank and not by its Foreign Currency Banking Unit. The accounts may be current, savings, or deposit accounts, but withdrawal of funds by checks is not permitted. Credits to these accounts are limited to inward remittances and to amounts in Sri Lanka rupees authorized by the Controller of Exchange for remittance abroad; debits are limited to outward remittances and to payments in foreign currency con- verted into Sri Lanka rupees. Nonresident travelers may take out foreign exchange declared to the customs at the time of entry. Unspent rupee balances from foreign exchange sold by nonresi- dent travelers may be reconverted into foreign currency, provided that the Customs Declaration Card indicates that at least the equivalent of such balances has been brought into Sri Lanka. The amount of foreign currency notes that diplomats, other foreign missions, and their non-Sri Lanka staff traveling abroad can take with them is limited to 20 percent of their travel expenses. Residents may take out foreign currency notes and coin not exceeding £ stg. 20 a person (£ stg. 10 for children under 12 years) of the exchange authorized for travel. All persons leaving Sri Lanka may take out domestic currency notes not exceeding SL Rs 250 a person. Exports and Export Proceeds A number of specified items require prior licensing by the Controller of Imports and Exports. The State Gem Corporation exercises control over exports of gems; exports of gems by the private sector on a consignment basis require prior approval of exchange control. The Corporation handles exports in the name of miners who wish to export their gems. Re-exports of nonmonetary gold, silver, diamonds, and platinum are allowed only in special circumstances. Foreign exchange proceeds from exports must be collected within a period ranging from 21 days to 6 months depending on the form of payment. Also, all export proceeds exceeding SL Rs 500,000 in value must be sold forward to a local bank. Special arrangements apply to exports made under trade and payments agree- ments and to exports made to a member country of the Asian Clearing Union. Proceeds from Invisibles Unless otherwise specified, foreign exchange pro- ceeds from invisibles must be surrendered.

SRI LANKA entering Sri Lanka must declare his holdings, including currency notes and coin. The amount of foreign funds that may be carried into Sri Lanka in the form of travel credit instruments is not restricted. The import of Indian and Pakistani currency is not permitted. A person entering Sri Lanka may bring in domestic currency notes not exceeding SL Rs 250. Other currency notes and coin may be brought in without restriction. Inward remittance of foreign exchange proceeds from invisibles of US$50,000 a transaction and above requires prior ap- proval by the Controller of Exchange. Capital Investments of foreign capital are permitted in projects which are specifically approved by the Government or, where the capital is drawn from a blocked account in Sri Lanka, in any local enterprise without the prior approval of the Controller of Exchange. Proceeds from the sale or liquidation of investments in approved projects other than investments made from blocked accounts may be repatriated, along with capital appreciation. Proceeds from the sale or liquidation of investments not approved by the Government may not be transferred abroad but may be reinvested with the approval of the Controller of Exchange; the current income thereon may be remitted abroad. New foreign investments in Sri Lanka that are ap- proved by the Foreign Investment Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Finance and Planning or the Greater Colombo Economic Commission are also granted special facilities for remittances and taxation. Investments abroad by residents are not normally permitted. Resident-owned securities on which the principal, interest, or dividends are payable (either contractually or at the option of the holder) in any foreign currency must be declared to the Controller of Exchange, and the sale or transfer of such securities is allowed only with the permission of the Controller of Exchange. Authorized dealers may grant allocations to emigrants upon presentation of appropriate documentation. At the time of departure, emigrants can obtain passage to the country of migration by normal direct route and 20 percent of passage fare to cover excess baggage. Exchange equivalent to £ stg. 500 an adult and £ stg. 250 a child under 12 years of age can also be purchased at the time of departure. Personal effects up to SL Rs 15,000 and jewelry up to SL Rs 30,000 for each female emigrant and SL Rs 10,000 for each male emigrant can be exported.

Commercial imports of jewelry and of other articles containing gold are severely restricted. Gold Changes During 1985 Imports and exports of gold in any form require licenses issued by the Controller of Imports and Exports No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 472 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SUDAN (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Sudan is the Sudanese pound. There are two exchange markets: (i) the official market, in which the exchange rate for the Sudanese pound is in principle pegged to the SDR but is in practice closely linked with the U .S. dollar at a rate of US$1 = LSd 2.50; and (ii) a commercial bank market operated by authorized banks for all other exchange transactions where banks are permitted to set their own buying and selling rates for foreign currencies.l The allocation of specific transactions between these markets is as follows. The official market handles all export proceeds; import payments (including freight payments) for petroleum, sugar, wheat, flour, agricultural inputs, and essential Pharmaceuticals; invisible receipts of selected interna- tional organizations; hotel and travel expenses incurred by foreign tourists; loans and aid flows to the public sector;2 debt service payments on public sector debt; proceeds of direct investment in mining and petroleum exploration; commercial banks' capital repatriation ap- proved for such by the Bank of Sudan; and other specified payments as instructed by the Bank of Sudan. All other exchange transactions are conducted through the commercial bank market. Transactions with Egypt, with which Sudan maintains a bilateral payments agree- ment, are excluded from the above-mentioned regula- tions, with the exception of those not covered under the agreement. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Bank of Sudan, with the assistance of the authorized banks. Beginning from February 12, 1985, private nonbank foreign exchange dealers are prohibited from conducting foreign exchange operations. The issuance of registra- tion forms and the licensing of imports and exports (except of gold) are the responsibility of the Ministry of Cooperation, Commerce, and Supply, but all registration forms and licenses must be validated by the Bank of Sudan. Official import payments and other foreign payments are approved within the framework of an annual foreign exchange budget drawn up by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, in coordi- nation with the Bank of Sudan and the Ministry of Cooperation, Commerce, and Supply.

Foreign Currency Accounts Residents are allowed to keep foreign exchange in "free" or "private" foreign exchange accounts, depend- ing on the source of funds. Balances in the free accounts may be replenished only from: direct transfers from abroad; foreign exchange registered on customs declara- tions; and salary payments in foreign currency by Arab organizations. A free account may not be replenished with foreign currency transferred from another free account or private account with funds from unknown sources. Balances in free accounts may be used only for: (i) importation in accordance with prevailing laws; (ii) transfers abroad; (iii) withdrawal (in the form of traveler's checks or cash, the latter up to a limit of US$200) for travel abroad by the account holder and his family after verification of fulfillment of travel require- ments; (iv) payments made in bank checks to the Duty- Free Shop Corporation; (v) payments of hotel bills and travel tickets by certified check in foreign currency; and (vi) purchases of Sudanese pounds at the commercial bank rate.3 Balances in the private accounts may be augmented only from transfers from abroad by interna- tional organizations and members of the diplomatic corps, specified Arab organizations, and foreign compa- nies operating in oil drilling and mining, construction, engineering, and similar activities; such balances can also be used for purposes (i), (ii), and (iii) mentioned above, and for purchases of Sudanese pounds at the official rate. Interest payments on current bank accounts denominated in foreign currencies are prohibited. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Certain imports are prohibited for protective reasons and others are not being licensed. Permitted imports are financed from different sources according to categories. Essential imports are financed from Bank of Sudan resources; all other imports are financed from commer- cial banks' own resources or from foreign exchange furnished by customers from free or private foreign exchange accounts. Import licenses must be obtained from the Ministry of Cooperation, Commerce, and Supply for all goods imported into Sudan, and are granted upon favorable decision from an interministerial imports committee 3On January 31, 1986, the use of free accounts to finance imports or make certain current invisible payments was prohibited. 473 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SUDAN (Committee for the Rationalization of Imports). Prior to licensing, public sector imports must secure approval from the Ministry of Finance, and imports under a foreign aid program must be approved by the Commod- ity Aid Committee. All import licenses must be validated at the General Administration for Foreign Exchange (GAFE) of the Bank of Sudan. Import insurance nor- mally must be taken out with local companies. Most imports are subject to an advance deposit of 5 percent of the c . i . f. value, payable before validation, if the import is financed through the commercial banks' foreign exchange market. Goods that otherwise would be subject to the advance deposit requirement are exempt when financed with suppliers' credit of at least two years' maturity, provided that the amount of the transaction is at least LSd 500,000. If a letter of credit is opened, the authorized bank usually requires a cash margin deposit ranging from 10 percent to 100 percent of transaction value, depending on the import category; for agricultural and industrial inputs, the margin requirement is 10 percent. A stamp duty of LSd 5 is levied on the application form for each transfer in respect of private sector imports. There are arrears on payments for imports. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles made through the commercial banks' foreign exchange market do not require prior approval from the GAFE. Insurance payments require a certificate from the insurance comptroller; transfers for medical treatment require a certified cost estimate from the Medical Commission; transfer of royalties payable to foreign bodies require a royalty exchange permit from the government body concerned (generally, the Ministry of Industry). Authorized banks may accept foreign exchange up to US$5,000 or the equivalent in other hard currencies from residents, irrespective of their source, to be exchanged for traveler's checks or bank checks for traveling abroad. In addition, allocations to travelers to Egypt are authorized by the commercial banks up to a maximum of LSd 300 a person a year in clearing dollars. Departing travelers must provide evidence that foreign exchange in their possession was acquired through a commercial bank, drawn from a foreign exchange account, or has been reported on a declaration form prior to entry into Sudan. The exportation of Sudanese currency over LSd 20 is prohibited. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Except when exporting cotton, gum arabic, and live- stock, all exporters must submit export contracts accom- panied by an export license and obtain approval from the Bank of Sudan, through an authorized commercial bank handling the transaction. All commodities are subject to minimum export prices. The proceeds must be repatri- ated to the banking system within four months from the date of shipment. All export proceeds must be surren- dered to the Bank of Sudan at the official exchange rate. 474 When the terms of payment are cash against documents or sight letters of credit, the proceeds must be surren- dered on delivery of the shipping documents; otherwise a surrender date is usually specified. Some major export commodities are exported solely by public sector entities. There is an export tax on gum arabic, cotton, hides and skins, and selected metals. Proceeds from Invisibles Sudanese nationals working abroad (SNWA) are allowed to keep free foreign exchange accounts. The repatriation of funds from SNWAs is transacted through the commercial bank market; since June 1985, a bonus is offered in the form of a pound-denominated coupon equal to 15 percent of the amount valued at the official exchange rate. Coupons can be used by the SNWA to pay customs duties, make purchases in duty-free shops, or exchange them for a car import license (if an amount equivalent to US$8,000 is sold), or for an entitlement to buy land from the Government at a favorable price (if an amount equivalent to US$20,000 is sold). Travelers entering Sudan may bring in any amount in notes and coin of other currencies, but the importation of more than LSd 20 in Sudanese currency is prohibited. Declara- tion of foreign exchange holdings at the port of entry is optional but advisable for those who want to repatriate such fund s .4 Capital All incoming private sector foreign capital (loans or equity), other than bank capital, is converted at the commercial bank rate. Repatriation of share capital and loan principal to nonresidents is subject to the submis- sion of a certificate from the Bank of Sudan stating the value of the foreign share in the capital and the loans received in the Sudan; equity shares require a certifica- tion of liquidation and of tax compliance. Public sector capital inflows and debt service payments are effected through the official exchange market. Gold Residents may purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in Sudan for numismatic purposes. Subject to certain conditions, residents may also purchase, hold, and sell domestically produced gold in Sudan. With these excep- tions, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Ministry of Cooperation, Commerce, and Supply; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. Some newly mined gold is exported for processing and subsequent reimportation. 4Beg inn ing from January 31, 1986, the declaration of foreign exchange is a legal requirement for all arrivals into the Sudan holding more than US$2,000. For holdings of less than this amount, the declaration is optional, but an official declaration is required for the foreign exchange to be credited to a foreign currency account or to be re-exported. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement February 12. The exchange arrangement was modi- fied to consist of the following two markets: (a) the official market, in which the Sudanese pound was pegged to the U .S. dollar at the rate of US$1 = LSd 2.50; and (b) a commercial bank market where the exchange rate would be announced by a committee established for this purpose by the Association of Banks. The following transactions were allocated to the official market: all export proceeds; import payments (including freight payments) for petroleum, sugar, wheat, flour, agricultural imports and essential pharmaceuticals; invis- ible receipts of selected international organizations; hotel and travel expenses incurred by foreign tourists; loans and flows to the public sector; debt service payments on public sector debt; proceeds of direct investment in mining and petroleum exploration; commercial bank capital repatriation approved for such by the Bank of Sudan; and other specified payments as instructed by the Bank of Sudan. All other exchange transactions would be conducted through the commercial bank market. March 22. Authorization was granted for each bank to set its own buying and selling rates for foreign currencies freely and independently. In addition, the banks were required to post their prevailing rates for at least the U.S. dollar, Saudi riyal, and pound sterling and to report their closing rates to the Bank of Sudan on a daily basis. August 12. The Sudanese pound was pegged to an undisclosed basket of currencies at the prevailing rate of LSd 2.50 = US$1. (The basket peg was informally discontinued in late September 1985.) Administration of Control February 12. It was announced that private nonbank foreign exchange dealers would no longer be permitted to conduct foreign exchange operations. Foreign Currency Accounts February 12. It was announced that "free" foreign exchange accounts held by residents could not be replenished with foreign currency transferred from an- other foreign exchange account or with funds from unknown sources. Moreover, balances in such accounts could only be used for the following purposes: (a) importation in accordance with prevailing laws; (b) transfers abroad; (c) foreign currency withdrawals (in the form of traveler's or bank checks or cash, the latter up to a limit of US$200) for travel abroad by the account SUDAN holder and his family, after verification of fulfillment of travel requirements; (d) payments made in bank checks to the Duty-Free Shop Corporation; (e) payments of hotel bills and travel tickets by certified check in foreign currency in accordance with the regulations on this subject; and (f) purchases of Sudanese pounds at the commercial bank rate. Imports and Import Payments February 12. The authority to validate imports trans- acted through the commercial bank foreign exchange market was transferred from the commercial banks to the Bank of Sudan, and financing of imports in that market was restricted to the following two sources: (a) foreign currency made available by banks to their customers from their resources, and (b) foreign exchange furnished by customers from foreign currency accounts. Import financing from foreign exchange cash holdings from unknown sources was prohibited. Exports and Export Proceeds February 12. The percentage of export proceeds from cotton and gum arabic that should be surrendered to the Bank of Sudan at the official exchange rate was increased from 75 percent to 100 percent. In addition, remaining export proceeds were transferred from the commercial bank foreign exchange market to the official foreign exchange market. Proceeds from Invisibles June 16. The following new regulations were issued with a view to attracting remittances from Sudanese nationals working abroad: for any amount of foreign exchange sold to commercial banks, a Sudanese national working abroad (SNWA) would receive Sudanese pounds at the commercial bank rate plus a bonus (equal to 10 percent of the amount sold) in the form of a pound- denominated coupon that could be exchanged at the official rate. The SNWA coupons could be used to pay customs duties, make purchases in duty-free shops, or be exchanged for a car import license (if an amount equivalent to US$10,000 was sold), or for an entitlement to buy land from the Government at a favorable price (if an amount equivalent to US$20,000 was sold). November 20. The bonus payable on funds repatriated by SNWAs was increased from 10 percent to 15 percent of value, and the minimum amount of repatriated funds to qua l ify for conversion of bonus coupons into a car import license was reduced from US$10,000 to US$8,000. 475 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SURINAME (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Suriname is the Suriname Guilder, which is pegged to the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, at Sf 1.78876 = US$1. On December 31, 1985 the official buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were Sf 1.77 and Sf 1.80, respectively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates for certain other currenciesl are set daily by the Central Bank on the basis of the market quotations for the U.S. dollar and the currencies con- cerned in Amsterdam and the above-mentioned rate of Sf 1.78876 = US$1, net of any commissions. There is no exchange market in Suriname. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchase or sales of foreign exchange. The commercial banks charge commissions of 1 percent on sales of foreign currency and 0.25 percent on transfers. Suriname formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from June 29, 1978. Administration of Control All foreign exchange transactions are subject to license, as are transactions between residents and non- residents in domestic currency and other domestic assets. The authority to grant exchange licenses is vested in the Foreign Exchange Board. An interministerial ad hoc committee under the auspices of the Ministry of Trans- port, Trade, and Industry grants import licenses. In principle, imports of medical supplies, fuels, raw mate- rials, spare parts, and educational supplies are given priority in the licensing system, but the fu ll basis for allocation is not published. Export licenses are granted by the Ministry of Transport, Trade, and Industry. The Central Bank is empowered to provide foreign exchange for import payments (subject to presentation of an import license); the latter authority is exercised through the commercial banks, which have been appointed as autho- rized banks by the Foreign Exchange Board. These banks may accept free of license those inward transfers of foreign exchange that do not result from borrowing abroad; the taking up of foreign loans is subject to approval by the Foreign Exchange Board. Except for limited amounts of foreign exchange for invisible pay- ments not requiring an exchange license, the authorized banks are not permitted to sell foreign exchange without the submission of an exchange license by the remitter. Prescription of Currency Settlements in Suriname guilders between Suriname and foreign countries are not permitted; they must, in general, be made in convertible currencies.2 'Deutsche mark, French francs, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Barbados dollars, and Guyana dollars. 2Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Barbados dollars, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Eastern Caribbean dollars, French francs, Guyana dollars, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, Trinidad and Tobago dollars, and U .S. dollars. 476 Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents, whether banks or nonbanks, may freely open accounts in U .S. dollars with domestic banks; no overdrafts are permitted. Nonresidents other than banks may freely open accounts in Suriname guilders with domestic banks; certain debits and credits are covered by a general license, while all others are subject to a specific license. These accounts must not be overdrawn and, for certain specified purposes, debits must not exceed a total of Sf 3,000 a month. Authorized banks may open nonresident accounts in Suriname guilders in the name of nonresident banks; these accounts also must not be overdrawn. Authorized banks may open nonresident accounts on behalf of nonresidents drawing pensions from the Government or under company plans. A special permit is required to transfer pensions abroad. Nonresi- dent accounts in guilders may not be credited with Suriname bank notes mailed from abroad; nonresident foreign currency accounts may not be credited with Surinamese tender. Imports and Import Payments Import licenses are required for all imports.3 Imports of some commodities are prohibited,4 and imports of another group of commodities are subject to quotas under the Comprehensive Decree of May 11, 1982.5 By arrangement with a Swiss firm (the Societe Generate de Surveillance (SGS)), the authorities monitor invoicing of imports and exports. A government agency, the Suriname Central Import Service, acts as the main importer of staple foodstuffs, agricultural inputs, and 3However, two specified mining companies do not need licenses for their own import requirements. Similar exemptions may be granted to foreign companies for their industrial activities in Suriname, provided that they pay for their imports from their own foreign exchange holdings. 4The prohibition applies to imports of pigs (excluding those for breeding), chicken, duck, and turkey meat, pork, fish, shrimp, and crab —fresh, cooled or frozen, salted, dried or precooked (excluding kwie-kwie fish and smoked herring) —vegetables (excluding potatoes, onions, and garlic), edible roots and tubers, citrus, bananas, plantains, and coconuts, green and roasted coffee (excluding decaffeinated), rice and rice products (excluding baby food), sugar (excluding cubes and tablets weighing 5 grams or less a cube or tablet), aromatized or colored sugar or sugar syrup, noodles and macaroni, jam, je l ly, and marmalade (excluding those for diabetics), peanut butter, syrups, and concentrates for nonalcoholic beverages in packages of less than 5 kilograms (excluding those for diabetics), firewood and other nonprocessed wood, railroad ties, shingles, wooden structures for construction, wooden tiles and panels, wooden tools, handles, and coat hangers, men's and boy's shoes (excluding rubber and plastic boots and sport shoes), and sand, gravel, sidewalk tiles, and road bricks. Imports of some other items such as specified explosives and narcotics are prohibited for reasons of public policy or health. 5The commodities to which import quotas are applied include kwie- kwie fish, milk powder, potatoes, onions and garlic, f ru i ts and nuts (other than citrus, bananas, plantains, and coconuts), decaffeinated coffee, peanuts, baby food, tomato paste, and certain preserved vegetables, matches, furnishings, and ready-made clothing, and furniture made of wood, metal, bamboo or other materials (excluding those for business establishments such as offices, theaters, clinics, hotels, restaurants, and libraries). ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution certain other commodities. Import prices for food prod- ucts imported by other companies are checked against quotations collected by the Suriname Central Import Service. The import license serves as a general authorization for payment. In case of payment by letter of credit, the import license must be approved by the Minister of Transport, Trade, and Industry. Import licenses have a validity of six months, within which period the goods must be landed and paid for. A license fee of 1.5 percent and a statistical fee of 1.5 percent are levied on the c . i . f. value of all imports, including imports of gold. Payments for Invisibles Transactions involving outward remittances of foreign exchange are subject to licensing; application for a license must be made at least one month prior to the intended date for effecting such a transaction. Autho- rized banks and the General Post Office have authority to provide foreign exchange up to Sf 150 an item a month on account of certain services (bank charges, legal fees, membership dues, copy and patent rights, and so forth), as well as for advertising expenses and payments for books. Travel allowances for residents are subject to licensing and are limited to the equivalent of Sf 50 a person a calendar year for travel to Guyana and French Guiana; and Sf 475 a person a calendar year for travel to other countries. A traveler may take up the maximum amount of Sf 525 a year for travel to other countries, provided that he forfeits the right to take up foreign exchange for travel to Guyana and French Guiana (50 percent of these amounts for children under 12 years). The authorized bank must enter on the travel ticket the amount of foreign exchange sold and the date, the purchase of exchange for travel not being permitted until three days before departure. Bona fide applications for larger amounts of exchange for travel purposes are approved on a case-by- case basis. Both resident and nonresident travelers may take out Sf 100 in Suriname currency. The export by resident travelers of foreign bank notes is limited to the amount of their travel allowance. Remittances for sup- port of family members abroad require an individual license, which is granted only for full-time registered students of disciplines essential to but not taught in Suriname. Payments due as interest on loans and as net income from other investments, and payments of moderate amounts for amortization of loans or depreciation or direct investments, may be made if an application, supported by an auditor's report, is duly presented to the Foreign Exchange Board for verification. These pay- ments are temporarily suspended. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports require export licenses, which for most commodities are issued freely, provided that the exporter undertakes to surrender the foreign currency proceeds to an authorized bank within six months of shipment. SURINAME Export licenses for cattle, pigs, fresh beef and pork, and planting materials are granted only with the advice of the Director of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Fish- eries. The export of baboon wood is prohibited, and that of rice is subject to special regulations. Certain exporting companies have received special permission from the Foreign Exchange Board to maintain current accounts in foreign currency with their parent companies abroad and to use these for specified payments and receipts (includ- ing export proceeds). Exports of logs are subject to a tax of 10 percent to 50 percent of f .o.b. value, depending on the type of wood; and exports of rough-hewn timber are subject to a tax of 10 percent of f .o .b. value. All exports are subject to a statistical fee of 1.5 percent of the f .o .b. value. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange receipts from invisibles must be surrendered to an authorized bank. Travelers may bring in foreign currency without limit and up to Sf 100 in domestic currency. Travelers must declare all domestic and foreign currency in their possession on entry; resident travelers must exchange at an authorized bank any foreign currency in their possession. The amount which nonresidents may take out of the country in foreign currency must be smaller than the amount brought in and declared on entry. Nonresident travelers except residents of Guyana and French Guiana are required to change convertible currency in an amount equivalent to Sf 500 when entering Suriname at Zanderij International Airport or at Nickerie or Albina. Residents of Guyana and French Guiana should exchange convert- ible currency to an amount equivalent to Sf 200 (50 percent of these amounts for children under 12 years). Unspent balances of such guilders can be reconverted into convertible currency, provided that the visit was shorter than ten days in each case and the visitor spent more than Sf 50 a day. Capital A decision of September 21, 1960 of the Foreign Exchange Board provides for the transfer abroad of capital proceeds from the sale to residents or the liquidation of fully or partly foreign-owned companies or other forms of enterprise. The decision covers invest- ments made by nonresidents with foreign capital after July 31, 1953. It also provides for the annual transfer of profits and for the transfer at any time of the foreign exchange (including loans) imported by the nonresident entrepreneur for the company's use. Profits must be transferred within three years; otherwise, they are con- sidered to have become part of the firm's working capital and may only be transferred in annual installments of 20 percent. Transfers in accordance with these decisions have been temporarily suspended. The Foreign Exchange Board may, at its discretion, grant licenses for transfers abroad from a deceased's estate, up to a maximum of Sf 10,000. For estates of more than Sf 10,000, further annual transfers are 477 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SURINAME permitted so as to spread them over a period not exceeding ten years. The Board may allow emigrants (heads of family) to transfer in foreign exchange the equivalent of Sf 5,000 in a lump sum, and subsequently, Sf 5,000 a year. The head of a repatriating family may be permitted to transfer the equivalent of Sf 10,000 plus 10 percent of his total taxable earnings in Suriname accrued during his period of residence; if his Surinamese assets exceed the sum thus calculated, the excess may be transferred at a rate of Sf 10,000 a year. Transfers abroad in excess of Sf 10,000 a year may be authorized under exceptional circumstances. Outward transfers for these purposes have been temporarily reduced. Subject to certain requirements, residents may pur- chase or sell in specified countries6 Surinamese corpo- rate shares that have been designated as negotiable by the Foreign Exchange Board. Transfers for investment abroad or for the purchase of other foreign securities or real estate by residents are not permitted, although exceptions may be made for direct investments abroad when it is considered that Surinamese interests will benefit. All borrowing from nonresidents by nonbank residents requires prior approval by the Foreign Ex- change Board. The foreign transactions of authorized banks are restricted, in principle, to those undertaken for the account of their customers, and banks are required, in principle, to surrender to the Central Bank any excess of foreign currency purchased. Authorized banks are permitted to place a part of their liquid funds abroad and to use the short-term credit lines extended by their foreign correspondent banks as a source of operating funds. Following curtailment of such credit lines in early 1983, the Central Bank, the authorized banks, and the correspondent banks have made an arrangement whereby the Central Bank guarantees the letters of credit issued by the authorized banks by pledging its balances up to a specified ceiling, while the authorized banks keep their balances abroad at a minimum level.7 The ceiling on the outstanding letters of credit guaranteed by reserve pledges amounts to the equivalent of US$16.3 million; the authorized banks have generally been able to honor their letters of credit, so that the pledged central bank balances have not so far been drawn upon. The autho- rized banks have a general license to place abroad in short-term U .S. dollar assets the amounts corresponding to balances in their nonresident U .S. dollar accounts. Gold Producers of gold may sell only to the authorized gold buyers (the Central Bank and Grassalco). Locally pro- duced gold must be surrendered to the Foreign Exchange Board by sale to the Central Bank at a price closely related to the world market price. The authorized gold Belgium, Canada, France, Federal Republic of Germany, I ta ly, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Netherlands Antilles, United Kingdom, and United States. 7This arrangement applies to the nationally controlled Landbouw Bank, De Surinaamsche Bank and Hakrinbank and not to the Dutch- owned Algemene Bank Nederland. 478 buyers are permitted, however, to sell nuggets at freely agreed prices for industrial and artistic purposes; deal- ings between residents in gold bars and other forms of unworked gold, with the exception of nuggets, are prohibited. As local production does not meet demand for industrial purposes, the Central Bank may import some gold. Three kinds of gold coin, one with a face value of Sf 100, one Sf 200, and one Sf 250, are legal tender. Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Suriname for numismatic and investment purposes; authorized banks may freely negotiate gold coin among themselves and with other residents. Residents other than the monetary authorities, producers of gold, and authorized industrial and dental users are not allowed without special permission to hold or acquire gold in any form other than nuggets, jewelry, or coin, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require exchange licenses issued by the Foreign Exchange Board; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports of coin by authorized banks and for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, producers of gold, and industrial users. Residents arriving from abroad, however, may freely bring in gold, subject to declaration and provided that they surrender it to the Central Bank within 20 days. Nonresident travelers also may freely bring in gold, subject to declaration; they may re-export the declared amount freely. Imports of gold coin are duty free and those of unworked gold are subject to a duty of Sf 1.00 a gram, irrespective of origin. The general tariff for gold orna- ments is 60 percent ad valorem. Imports and exports of all forms of gold are subject to the statistical fee of 1.5 percent; in addition, imports are subject to a licensing fee of 1.5 percent. Changes During 1985 Payments for Invisibles January 15. Foreign exchange allowances for travel abroad were reduced to Sf 50 a person a day, up to Sf 250 a calendar year for travel to Guyana and French Guiana, and Sf 375 a person a calendar year for travel to all other countries. Use of the latter allowance would not preclude the other. February 21. A regulation was introduced requiring persons entering Suriname to exchange through official channels specified m in imum amounts of foreign cur- rency, as follows: (a) for residents of Guyana and French Guiana, the equivalent of Sf 200; and (b) for residents of all other countries, the equivalent of Sf 500. (Half of these amounts for children under 12 years.) The Foreign Exchange Commission could grant an exemption from this obligation for returning students and minors with parents residing in Suriname.

Not for Redistribution countries. Use of the latter allowance would not preclude the other. June 4. The decision of December 1977 in regard to transfers abroad of pensions on behalf of nonresidents was revoked, and it was announced that henceforth such transfers would be possible only with prior permit obtainable from the Foreign Exchange Commission. Exports and Export Proceeds July 18. It was announced that a special permit by the Import-Export-Foreign Exchange Control in the Ministry of Transportation, Commerce, and Industry would be required for presents to be sent abroad. Gifts worth up to Sf 50 consisting of specified domestic products would be exempt if taken by residents traveling abroad or by foreign tourists; in the latter case, proof of purchase and of exchange of foreign currency should be shown. (Further clarification of the regulation was issued on Ju ly 25, 1985.) SURINAME 479 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SWAZILAND (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Swaziland is the Lilangeni (plural emalangeni), which is pegged to the South African rand at E 1 = R 1. Exchange rates for the U .S. dollar quoted by the Central Bank of Swaziland are based on the floating middle rate of the South African commercial rand against the U .S. dollar. On December 31, 1985 the official closing buying and selling rates were US$0.3915 and US$0.3905. On January 31, 1986 the official rates were US$0.4390 and US$0.4370, respectively, per E 1. Rates are also quoted for the deutsche mark, the French franc, the pound sterling, and the Swiss franc, based on the London and New York market quotations for these currencies against the U .S. dollar, and for the Kenya shilling and the Zambian kwacha, based on their rela- tionship to the SDR. The Central Bank of Swaziland will also quote rates for the currencies of member states of the Preferential Trade Area of Eastern and Southern African States (PTA), based on the relationship with the SDR as advised by the Clearing House operated by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Exchange Control Territory Swaziland forms part of a common monetary area, which is a single exchange control territory comprising Lesotho, South Africa, and Swaziland. No restrictions are applied to payments within the Rand Monetary Area, and in principle, these are not controlled. In relation to countries outside the area, Swaziland applies exchange controls that are generally similar to those of South Africa, but Swaziland has not adopted the dual exchange rate system which was reintroduced there in Septem- ber 1985. There are no bilateral payments arrangements. Administration of Control The Central Bank of Swaziland, on behalf of the Ministry of Finance, controls all external currency transactions. Imports and Import Payments Swaziland is a member of a customs union with Botswana, Lesotho, and South Africa, and there are no import restrictions on goods originating in any country of the customs union. Imports from South Africa do not require licenses and include an unknown quantity of goods originating outside the customs union. Insofar as Swaziland imports goods directly from countries outside the customs un ion, such imports are usually licensed in conformity with South Afr ica's import regulations. 480 Import licenses are valid for all countries and entitle the holder to buy the foreign exchange required to make the import payment. Exports and Export Proceeds Certain exports are subject to licensing. Exporters must make a declaration that the proceeds from their exports will be repatriated in the prescribed manner and within the stipulated period. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments to nonresidents for current transactions, while subject to control, are not normally restricted. Authority to approve some types of current payments is delegated to authorized dealers up to established limits. The basic exchange allowance for tourist travel to neighboring countries is E 2,000 an adult and E 1,000 a child, a year; the corresponding annual allowances for tourist travel to other countries are E 6,000 and E 3,000, respectively. For business travel to neighboring coun- tries, the basic annual allowance is E 4,000 a person at rates not exceeding E 400 a day; the corresponding limits for business travel to other countries are E 10,000 and E 500, respectively. A higher basic allowance can be obtained for business and medical travel. To use credit cards outside the Rand Monetary Area, a resident cardholder must complete a letter of undertaking prior to departure. Capital Inward capital transfers should be properly docu- mented in order to facilitate the subsequent repatriation of interest, dividends, profits, and other income. No person may borrow foreign currency or register shares in the name of a nonresident, or act as a nominee for a nonresident, without prior approval. Applications for most outward transfers of capital are considered on their merits. Blocked emalangeni may be invested in quoted securities and other such investments as may be approved by the Central Bank. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement and Capital Swaziland did not participate in the "standstill" ar- rangement adopted by South Africa from Septem- ber 1985 in regard to external debt servicing. In addition, the Rand Monetary Agreement was renegotiated during the year and renamed Trilateral Monetary Agreement between Lesotho, Swaziland, and South Africa; in this context, legal tender status for the Rand currency was scheduled to be eliminated in Swaziland with effect from April 1, 1986. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SWEDEN (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Sweden is the Swedish Krona. In managing the exchange rate of the krona, the Sveriges Riksbank (the central bank) is guided by a trade- weighted index based on a basket of 15 currencies of Sweden's most important trading partners. In construct- ing the index, the Swedish authorities established two criteria to be met by each country and currency included in the basket: (1) the country had to account for at least 1 percent of Sweden's total foreign trade (exports plus imports) during the previous five-year period, and (2) each currency had to be quoted daily on the foreign exchange market in Stockholm. The weights are propor- tional to Sweden's foreign trade with each of the countries whose currencies are included in the index, with the exception that the weight of the U .S. dollar has been doubled and that of the other currencies adjusted accordingly. To take account of changes in average trade shares, the weights are adjusted each year (on April 1) on the basis of trade statistics for the last five calendar years. At present, the weights are as follows (base period 1980-84): U .S. dollar Deutsche mark Pound sterling Norwegian krone Danish krone Finnish markka French franc Netherlands guilder Belgian franc Italian lira Japanese yen Swiss franc Austrian schilling Spanish peseta Canadian dollar Total 20.7 15.9 12.9 9.4 8.0 6.9 5.4 4.9 3.7 3.6 2.9 2 .1 1.4 1.2 1.0 100.0 The index value of 132 represents the benchmark for the effective value following the devaluation on October 8, 1982 (August 29, 1977 = 100). The exchange rate is managed so as to allow only limited fluctuations around this benchmark; beginning in June 1985, fluctuations in the spot rate are limited within 1.5 percent on either side of the announced benchmark. An average of the daily index values is published weekly by the Riksbank. The market buying and selling rates for spot transactions in U .S. dollars, the intervention cur- rency, on December 31, 1985 were SKr 7.6130 and SKr 7.6180, respectively, per US$1. Spot rates for other currencies are established on the basis of the cross rates in international markets. Forward market rates are left to the interplay of market forces. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Authorized banks may buy from and sell to other authorized banks any foreign currency on a spot basis against another foreign currency or Swedish kroner. They may also purchase (sell) foreign currencies, spot, from foreign banks and other nonresidents against any foreign currency or Swedish kronor credited (debited) to an External Kronor Account (see section on Nonresident Accounts, below). Authorized banks may conclude w i th residents other than banks forward exchange transactions in foreign currencies against Swedish kronor covering current and authorized payments for (1) unlimited periods in respect of receipts, on the one hand, and payments for imports, freight, and charter services, on the other; (2) periods not exceeding 12 months in respect of repayment of loans abroad for refinancing of credits granted in Swed- ish kronor in connection with Swedish exports; and (3) 6 months in respect of other payments. Forward transactions may be concluded only to cover payments for which an agreement exists. However, export firms may make forward sales of settlement on the envisaged date of payment or, when tendering, on the expiry date for tendering. A bank may not credit a customer with any profit on canceled forward transactions. Under specified conditions, Swedish residents who have raised loans in foreign currency may buy forward the currency of the loan against another foreign currency. Authorized banks may buy from and sell to other authorized banks, forward, any foreign currency against another foreign currency or Swedish kronor. Authorized banks may buy from or sell to foreign banks, on a forward basis, any foreign currency against another foreign currency or Swedish kronor for a period not exceeding 12 months. Such transactions with foreign banks may, however, be for periods exceeding 12 months if made in cover of forward transactions with residents. Sweden formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from February 15, 1961. Administration of Control Exchange controls are administered by the Riksbank through its Exchange Control Board. Authorized banks and certain other authorized agencies implement the exchange control regulations. All current payments are exempt from exchange control, provided that they are made through authorized banks. These banks have also been granted general licenses to approve various pay- ments that are subject to exchange control. When required, import and export licenses are issued by the Board of Commerce, except those for foodstuffs, which are issued by the National Agricultural Marketing Board. 481 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SWEDEN Prescription of Currency Payments to and from foreign countries may be made in any foreign currency or in Swedish kronor through an External Kronor Account (see section on Nonresident Accounts, below). Nonresident Accounts There are two main types of nonresident accounts held in Swedish kronor: External Kronor Accounts and Restricted Accounts. External Kronor Accounts may be held with autho- rized banks by nonresidents domiciled abroad. They may be credited with authorized payments to foreign coun- tries by residents, transfers from other External Kronor Accounts, and sales of any foreign currency. They may be debited for authorized payments to residents, trans- ferred to any other External Kronor Account, and may be used for conversion into any foreign currency. They do not normally bear interest. Restricted Accounts are held by persons who have become nonresidents after emigrating. The accounts may be credited with, for example, earnings and proceeds from sales of assets in Sweden, inheritances and amorti- zation on loans granted before emigration, or with funds from Restricted Accounts. Balances in Restricted Ac- counts may be used for payments in Sweden for such items as expenses related to assets in Sweden, mainte- nance costs, purchase of Swedish securities and real estate in Sweden, and loans to residents. Imports and Import Payments With the exception of some agricultural and fishery products, practically all goods are free from quantitative restriction and import licensing when imported from countries other than Albania, Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, the German Demo- cratic Republic, Hungary, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, the U .S .S .R ., and Viet Nam. However, most imports from these countries are liberalized. Imports of certain textile products from some countries and territories (Brazil, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Macao, Malaysia, Malta, Mauritius, Pakistan, the Phil- ippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwant, Thailand, and Yugoslavia) are limited through special arrangements. In addition, imports of specified textiles and garments from any source other than EC countries (except Greece, Portugal, and Spain) or EFT A countries, Greenland, and the Faeroe Islands, as well as imports of most iron and steel products from all countries, are subject to import licensing for surveillance purposes. Payments for imports may, as current payments, be made freely through an authorized bank. Importers are also permitted to accept foreign suppliers' credits, provided that such credits are regarded as customary. tSee Explanatory Note on coverage of Part Two, page 75. 482 Payments for Invisibles Invisible payments that are considered as current may be made by residents in favor of nonresidents without restrictions, provided that they are made through an authorized bank. Occasional payments not exceeding the equivalent of SKr 3,000 are considered current regard- less of the purpose. Foreign exchange for travel abroad may be allocated by authorized banks and other autho- rized agencies up to an amount considered reasonable in light of the purpose and duration of the journey. Each person leaving Sweden may take out Swedish bank notes and coin up to SKr 6,000. Nonresidents leaving Sweden may export freely foreign bank notes and other means of payment that have been acquired abroad or from an authorized bank or other authorized agency in Sweden. While abroad, residents may open accounts abroad, provided that at the end of the stay the balance is transferred to Sweden. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to the People's Democratic Republic of Korea, as well as exports of special steel to the United States, are subject to export licensing. All exports, with some exceptions such as ships and scrap metal, are free from license. Proceeds from exports of goods may be sold to an authorized bank for kronor or kept in a foreign currency account with an authorized bank and used by the holder to make authorized payments abroad. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles are subject to the same treatment as those from exports (see section on Exports and Export Proceeds, above). Each person entering Sweden may, for traveling expenses, bring in unlimited amounts of bank notes, coin, and other means of payment. Capital The various categories of capital transactions are governed by specific regulations as follows: (a) Direct investments. A permit from the Riksbank is required for direct investments abroad by residents. It is usually granted, sometimes on condition that it should be financed by a loan in a foreign currency abroad with an average maturity of at least five years. New investment in South Africa and Namibia has been banned since July 1, 1979. Foreign direct investments in Sweden require a permit from the Riksbank, which is always given. Investments below SKr 5 million may be financed with domestic credit, as may up to 50 percent of individual investments beyond that amount. (b) Loans. Swedish exporters and importers are nor- mally authorized to raise foreign-currency loans abroad or from an authorized bank in order to finance suppliers' credits and imports, respectively. Loans with a life of up to six months can be obtained from an authorized bank without a special permit from the Riksbank, provided ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution that the purpose is to finance exports or imports of goods. Authorized banks may consequently raise loans abroad in foreign currency for on-lending to enterprises for that purpose. The granting of government-subsidized credits, which AB Svensk Exportkredit administers, can be arranged in accordance with general exemptions issued by the Riksbank. The Riksbank normally grants permits to enterprises and local governments to raise medium- and long-term loans in foreign currency abroad, provided the average life of the loans is at least two years; loans not exceeding the equivalent of SKr 10 million can be raised from an authorized bank by enterprises and local governments without a permit from the Riksbank. Loans to finance authorized direct investments abroad must have an average life of at least five years. (See (a), above.) Residents are not normally permitted to extend finan- cial loans to nonresidents. However, upon application, authorized banks are permitted to extend to the foreign counterpart of a Swedish exporter or importer credit intended to finance import and export transactions, and to refinance such credit through a corresponding foreign borrowing. (c) Transactions in securities. Residents do not need authorization to sell portfolio holdings of foreign securi- ties to nonresidents. The purchase of foreign securities from nonresidents by residents is as a rule not permitted. However, authorized banks and stockbrokers may on behalf of residents purchase from nonresidents foreign securities and listed Swedish securities denominated in foreign currencies if payment is made with proceeds from sales to nonresidents of Swedish-held securities denominated in a foreign currency and the purchase is made within six months of the corresponding sale. A general license permits the repurchase from abroad of listed Swedish securities denominated in kronor, pro- vided that a bona fide nonresident ownership is con- firmed by an affidavit or by registration with the Securities Register Center. Authorized banks and stockbrokers may handle pur- chases by nonresidents of listed Swedish securities expressed in Swedish kronor if the payment is made with the proceeds from sales of other similar securities to residents and if certain other conditions are fulfilled. The Riksbank is also prepared to authorize sales to nonresi- dents of listed Swedish shares if the sale is judged to be beneficial for export sales, or for the capital supply of the company concerned, or if it is considered that there are special reasons. (d) Recreational dwellings. Residents may, on appli- cation, transfer abroad up to SKr 250,000 a family to purchase a recreational dwelling. (e) Emigration. When emigrating, a resident is per- mitted, on application, to transfer up to SKr 200,000. The remainder of an emigrant's funds may be transferred after confirmation by the tax authorities that the emigrant is no longer residing in Sweden. SWEDEN (f) Other transfers. Authorized banks may approve payments abroad in respect of various categories of remittances (including g if ts), up to SKr 5,000 a calendar year. Transfers to nonresidents on account of inheritance are permitted. Residents may, without a permit from the Riksbank, accept capital receipts from abroad related to such purposes as life pensions, annuity contracts, con- tractual amortizations, the sales of foreign securities and real estate abroad, gifts, and inheritances. Ceilings are placed on the net foreign exchange holdings of each authorized bank. Banks may grant only normal overdrafts to nonresidents, and may incur foreign exchange liabilities, including a net liability in any one currency within individual limits set for each bank. This, together with the permission to pay interest on foreign exchange deposits held by nonresidents, enables the banks to borrow foreign currency from nonresidents for on-lending (but not in the form of kronor) to foreign banks. Swedish banks may, within individual limits set for each bank, borrow abroad freely in order to sell the proceeds against Swedish kronor in the market. Under certain conditions, they may be granted permission to borrow abroad to relend in Sweden (see above). Nonresi- dents' holdings of kronor in External Kronor Accounts must not be "abnormal," and, with minor exceptions, they cannot earn interest. Gold There are no special regulations on trading in gold. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement February 20. Swedish companies operating in South Africa, including subsidiaries of Swedish companies in third countries, were prohibited from leasing new equipment. March 18. Authorization was granted for foreign banks to open subsidiaries in Sweden. While generally subject to the same regulations as Swedish-owned banks, the subsidiaries were prohibited from taking sharehold- ings in existing Swedish banks, and their chairmen and two thirds of their board membership were required to be resident Swedes. Authorized banks were allowed to (i) trade without special permission foreign currency against Swedish krona in deals with foreign banks with a maturity of less than two days; (ii) arrange forward contracts not only with foreign banks but also with nonresidents; (iii) arrange forward contracts in two foreign currencies for unlimited time periods with the above-mentioned agents; and (iv) arrange forward con- tracts with a maturity shorter than that of the payment it is based on, if a prolongation is arranged until the due date of the payment. April 1. The Riksbank announced the new weights for the 15 currencies in the basket peg for the Swedish krona. (See section on Exchange Arrangement, above.) 483 ©International Monetary Fund.

The final three of eight agreed tariff reductions under the Tokyo Round were implemented. Gold November 22. With effect from December 1985, the Foreign Exchange Board abolished the prohibition on imports and exports of unworked gold, certain gold products, and gold coins, thus ending the regulation of trade in gold. 484 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SWITZERLAND1 (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Switzerland is the Swiss Franc. The Swiss National Bank does not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions; exchange rates are determined, in principle, on the basis of underlying demand and supply conditions in the exchange markets. However, the Swiss National Bank reserves the right to intervene if and when warranted by prevailing circum- stances. The principal intervention currency is the U .S. dollar; the market rate for the Swiss franc in terms of the U .S. dollar on December 31, 1985 was Sw F 2.0625 per US$1. All settlements may be made at free market rates. Foreign bank notes are negotiated freely in Switzerland at rates determined by the interplay of supply and demand. Exchange Control Territory For all purposes of import and export the Principality of Liechtenstein is included in the Swiss customs territory. For purposes of exchange control, natural persons domiciled in Liechtenstein are considered by Switzerland as residents and so are juridical persons (including banks), other than letterbox companies, operating business in either country. However, this rule does not apply if the acquisition of Swiss real estate is involved. Liechtenstein is considered a foreign country for purposes of banking supervision. Administration of Control Authority to impose measures for the control of imports, exports, and payments is vested in the Swiss Federal Council acting on the advice of the Federal Department of Public Economy or the Federal Depart- ment of Foreign Affa irs. The Swiss National Bank is the advisory and executive authority in matters of currency for both Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Prescription of Currency Settlements may be made or received in any currency. Imports and Import Payments With minor exceptions, imports into Switzerland may be made freely. The importation of butter and alcohol is subject to state monopoly. The most important com- modities subject to license, irrespective of their origin, are certain agricultural products, petroleum products, and washing preparations and their compounds. Import permits for goods under license are generally granted freely, but global quotas are established for certain agricultural products. Imports of textiles from specified countries are subject to price surveillance or price 'Switzerland is not a member of the International Monetary Fund. certification. Payments for imports from all countries may be made freely. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles may be made freely. The export of Swiss and foreign bank notes is unrestricted. Exports and Export Proceeds The export (including re-export) of some goods is subject to export control through individual licenses. This export licensing system is operated in part with the assistance of appropriate semiofficial or private organ- izations. Export proceeds are freely disposable. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles are freely disposable. The import of Swiss and foreign bank notes is unrestricted. Capital Transfers of capital may be made without formality, except that bank credits and other bank lending to nonresidents, when amounting to or exceeding Sw F 10 million each and with a maturity of 12 months or more, require permission. Permission is also required for foreign bond issues in Switzerland and for direct participations or subparticipations by Swiss banks in Eurobond issues and Eurocurrency credits. All proposed first placements of medium-term negotiable paper (notes) in amounts of Sw F 10 million or more must be submitted to the National Bank for authorization. The National Bank w i ll not approve foreign bond issues with an original maturity of less than eight years; the maturity period for notes is between 18 months and 8 years, w i th a m in imum denomination of Sw F 50,000. This mini- mum nominal value may be reduced as a result of partial repayments. Premature repayments of bonds may, in general, be made only after 5 years, wh i le advance repayments of notes may be made as early as 18 months after placement but not before one half of the overall maturity has elapsed. Notes must remain deposited for the total period of issue w i th the issuing bank, with a bank that has participated in the issuing syndicate, or with the Swiss Security Clearing Organization (SEGA). The bank requesting authorization is required to indicate to the National Bank if notes are to be placed exclusively or predominantly with foreign governments or monetary authorities. The National Bank reserves the right in such cases to condition its authorization on a special agree- ment with the foreign authority concerned. Foreign institutions are allowed to participate as sub-underwriters in syndicated Swiss franc capital export transactions, provided that they are not mentioned either in the arrangement or pub l ic ly.

In 1985 the banks were not subject to reserve requirements; they are permitted to pay interest on Swiss franc deposits (includ- ing "fiduciary" or "trustee" funds) received from non- residents. A select number of banks and finance companies are required to report their positions (their own assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, spot and forward) in foreign currencies on a monthly basis, and their dealer position on a weekly basis. Swiss banks may participate in loans with multiple currency clauses. Purchases of real estate in Switzerland by or on behalf of persons or firms of foreign nationality who are domiciled or resident abroad require approval by the canton where the property is situated. The approvals of the cantons are subject to supervision and appeal by the Confederation. Gold Swiss gold coins are not legal tender. Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad. There is a free gold market in Zurich. Imports and exports of gold in any form by residents and nonresidents are unrestricted and free of license. No customs duties or other charges are levied on exports of gold. Imports of gold bars and of certain gold coins are exempt from customs du ty, but all sales of gold bars and coins within Switzerland are subject to the retail sales tax. An exception is made, however, in certain circum- stances for gold or gold coins purchased by foreign central banks. Import and export licenses, which are issued freely, are required for commercial imports and exports of certain articles containing gold. Changes During 1985 Exports and Export Proceeds March 18. The premia charged under the Federal Export Risk Guarantee Scheme were raised by about 45 percent. In addition, foreign exchange risk coverage was suspended for an indefinite period with effect from April 1, 1985. Capital May 15.

Not for Redistribution SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Syrian Arab Republic is the Syr- ian Pound, which is pegged to the U .S. dollar, the inter- vention currency, at LS 3.925 = US$1 in the official market. On April 22, 1981 the Syrian Arab Republic re- established a parallel market along with the official market. In addition, two other rates are applied as follows: a foreign exchange market (the "tourist mar- ket") with a more depreciated rate than the parallel market rate applies to private inward transfers and tourist transactions; a fourth market applies to purchases of for- eign exchange for travel and medical expenses abroad, at a rate of LS 11.25 per US$1. The parallel market normally covers private transactions, including import payments by the private sector, while the official market covers most transactions of the public sector. The Syrian Arab Republic confines its buy ing and selling rates for the U .S. dollar w i th in LS 3.90 and LS 3.95, respec- tively, per US$1 in the official market; on December 31, 1985 the official buy ing and selling rates were LS 3.90 and LS 3.95, respectively, per US$1. Buy ing and selling rates for all major currencies are quoted on the basis of the official market rates, the parallel market rates, and the tourist market rates for the U .S. dollar and the market rates for the currencies concerned in markets ab road .l Administration of Control Policy with regard to imports and exports is deter- mined by the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade. Under an agreement between the Central Bank of Syria and the Administrative Committee of the Exchange Office, all transactions of the Exchange Office are carried out through the Central Bank. Import licenses are issued by the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade, and exchange licenses for invisibles and capital transac- tions, by the Exchange Office. Only authorized com- mercial banks may deal in foreign exchange. The commercial banks may open letters of credit only w i th the prior approval of the Exchange Office. At present there is one authorized bank, the Commercial Bank of Syria, which has been authorized by the Exchange Office to open letters of credit and accept bills for collection w i thout prior approval, provided that certain conditions are fu l f i l led. Prescription of Currency The Exchange Office is empowered to prescribe the currencies to be obtained for exports. Proceeds of exports to all countries may be obtained in any convert- ible currency, and such proceeds may also be received in 'Be lg ian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deu tsche ma rk, French francs, Iraqi dinars, I ta l ian lire, Jordan d ina rs, Lebanese pounds, Netherlands gu i lde rs, pounds s ter l ing, Saudi A rab ian r iya ls, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and U .S. dollars. bank notes denominated in convertible currencies and declared at the border posts of entry.

The Syrian Arab Republic ma in ta ins bilateral payments agreements with the Islamic Republic of Iran, Sri Lanka, the U . S . S .R ., and Viet N am, of wh ich the first and the third are operative. Nonresident and Foreign Currency Accounts Nonresident accounts in Syrian pounds may be cred- ited w i th the proceeds of foreign currencies sold to the authorized bank and w i th payments for goods. They may be debited w i thout prior approval to pay for Syrian exports to the country of the account holder and for expenses in the Syrian Arab Republic. Residents wishing to open foreign currency accounts are required to present evidence in writing that they have sources of income abroad. Nonresidents ( ind iv idua ls and corporations) may open accounts in convertible foreign currencies at autho- rized local banks for the deposit of funds from abroad. Balances in such accounts may be sold to local banks, transferred abroad w i thout restrictions, or used in pay- ment for specified imports. Temporary nonresident accounts may be opened in the name of nonresidents temporarily resident in the Syrian Arab Repub l ic. These accounts may not be used, however, for funds received in settlement currencies, through payments conventions, or by diplomatic and UN missions and their staffs. Permitted credits include the local currency proceeds of foreign currency brought in at the parallel exchange market rate and amounts corresponding to import pay- ments that are not transferred. Debits for local expendi- tures are completely free, and debits for expenditures abroad also are permitted. Imports and Import Payments Imports of commodities originating in Egyp t, Israel, or South Africa are prohibited. Many basic commodities ( inc lud ing green coffee, tea, rice, tobacco, salt, paper, iron and steel, and certain agricultural machinery) are imported only by state-trading agencies or, for their own account, by certain other official agencies. Agencies exclusively qua l if ied to import may import certain commodities to meet the raw material needs of the private sector. Priorities in respect of private sector imports of spare parts, raw materials, and intermediate products are set by an import committee. Imports are divided into two categories: (1) imports prohibited by decree and specified in a Prohibited List, wh ich comprises mostly goods that are produced domes- t ica l ly, inc lud ing some textile products (however, waiv- ers may be granted in order to meet the needs of industry or to obtain supplies of foods tuffs); and (2) all other 487 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC goods. In principle, imports must come direct from the country of origin, without the intervention of any foreign firm; the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade has the authority, however, to permit certain goods to be imported from countries other than the country of origin. All imports, except those valued at less than LS 2,000 (LS 500 for imports from Lebanon) require licenses which must be obtained by the importer prior to the date of shipment of the goods. Operations of the state-trading agencies are governed by the annual foreign exchange budget. On the basis of the budget, these agencies submit documentation on their import requirements to the Ministry of Economy and the customs authorities, and import licenses are automatically issued. Certain imports (not appearing in the list of prohibited imports) from Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia are exempt from license, in accordance with the Arab Common Market Agreement. In such cases an authoriza- tion to import is granted in response to a written request. Payments for imports by the public sector are made at the official market rate solely by letters of credit, while those by the private sector are normally made at the parallel market rate. Private sector importers are autho- rized to import specified raw materials, capital goods, consumer goods, and spare parts. The importer is required to submit the import license and the pro forma invoice to the Commercial Bank of Syria, which pro- ceeds to open the letter of credit; approval by the Exchange Office is not required. A noninterest-bearing advance import deposit of 50 percent of import value is required for all private sector imports and is a condition for obtaining an import license. Licenses to import specified items that normally are prohibited (certain luxury consumer goods), up to a value of LS 70,000 in a 12-month period, are granted on request to merchants certified by the Chamber of Commerce and the Ministry of Supply and Internal Trade and whose names appear on the list of income tax payers published by the Ministry of Finance; no licenses are required for such imports with a value not exceeding LS 2,000 an item a month. Foreign currency accounts may be debited freely for import payments, provided that a license is obtained when necessary. Imports financeable from foreign currency obtained abroad are determined by product lists pub- lished as necessary by ministerial decree; items on the lists are limited to raw materials, production inputs, agricultural and industrial equipment, and spare parts. Such imports are not subject to the waiting list system, nor to the payment of an advance import deposit, provided that the deposits to be used in payment for the imports have been held in the local bank for at least three months and that the account holder has stayed at least one year outside the Syrian Arab Republic before opening such an account. Following the steps taken on September 25, 1985 to facilitate private sector imports, resident private sector importers, upon presentation of a draft or a letter from their foreign supplier granting 360-day credit facilities, may also import the items on lists hitherto reserved for nonresidents. Insurance on private sector imports must be procured locally. 488 There is a tax of 2 percent on the issue of import licenses, except for government imports and imports of certain essential items, inc lud ing raw materials, petro- leum, and petroleum products. In addition, there is a unified import surcharge, which has replaced all the previous special levies on imports (a statistical tax, a consumption tax, a defense tax, a school tax, a maritime transport tax, and a harbor tax). Payments for Invisibles Most payments for invisibles must be made at the tourist market rate, while trade-related transactions of the public sector are made at the official market rate and certain other specified payments at the parallel market rate. Both residents and nonresidents may freely take out foreign bank notes. Residents traveling abroad may also take w i th them other foreign exchange purchased at the tourist market rate as follows: for travel to other Arab countries (except Algeria, Jordan, Lebanon, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Morocco, and Tunisia) and to Cyprus and Turkey, the equivalent of LS 2,500 a trip; and for travel to other countries (including Algeria, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Morocco, and Tunisia), the equivalent of LS 5,000 a trip. Travelers to Jordan and Lebanon are not eligible for foreign exchange travel allowance, but may take w i th them up to LS 2,000 a trip in Syrian bank notes. For children ten years old or younger, the allowances are 50 percent of these amounts. Workers on secondment to a foreign country may take with them foreign exchange equivalent to 25 percent of the above- mentioned allocations and the entire amount of the allocations on production of proof that they have transferred foreign exchange from abroad. For travel to payments agreement countries, 50 percent of the travel allocation must be taken up through the clearing account concerned (30 percent for travel on official business). On departure, residents of Syrian nationality must pay an exit tax of LS 200 or LS 400 a person if traveling to Arab countries and LS 1,000 a person for other destinations. Fixed allocations are ma in ta ined for other transactions in invisibles, as follows: 60 percent of the salaries received by foreign technicians and experts employed in the Syrian Arab Republic, and 50 percent of the salaries of personnel of foreign diplomatic and international missions in the Syrian Arab Republic. All other transac- tions require the prior approval of the Exchange Office Committee. Nonresidents leaving the country are per- mitted to take out LS 100 in Syrian currency, and residents, LS 25. No approvals are granted for additional amounts. Nonresidents leaving the country are allowed to reconvert Syrian currency into foreign exchange up to the equivalent of LS 500 upon showing evidence of having purchased the currency from an off ic ial dealer. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of whea t, barley, cotton, cottonseed, and their derivatives are nationalized and are made by the Cereals Office or the Cotton Au thor i ty. Exports of petroleum are handled by the Petroleum Marketing Off ice. Exports of ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution certain other commodities also are reserved for govern- ment agencies, state-trading agencies, or specified com- panies. Exports of a few goods to all countries and all exports to Egypt, Israel, and South Africa are prohibited. Exports of certain products and of all goods of foreign origin require licenses. For all other exports, licenses are not required. For most exports, however, a repatriation commitment is required by which the exporter under- takes to bring the proceeds to the Syrian Arab Republic and surrender them to the Commercial Bank of Syria within six months after the date of export. The proceeds of public sector exports must be surrendered at the official market rate. Beginning from December 1985, proceeds from private sector exports, which previously had to be surrendered in part at the official market rate and in part at the parallel market rate, are subject to surrender at the tourist market rate. The Commercial Bank of Syria may accept prepayments for exports of Syrian products by residents and nonresidents without referring to the Central Bank of Syria. Certain manufac- tured exports receive subsidies from the Fund for the Development of Exports of Industrial Products. Exports of f ru i ts, vegetables, and olives, and crude oil and its derivatives are subject to an export tax of 12 per- cent ad valorem. Exports of other agricultural products are subject to an ad valorem agricultural tax of 9 percent plus 3 per mill when exported by sea. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions by the public sector must be sold at the official market rate, but those from transactions by the private sector must be sold at either the parallel market rate or the tourist market rate, according to the nature of the transaction. Nonresidents entering the Syrian Arab Republic are permitted to bring in unlimited foreign exchange in any form. Foreign bank notes may be brought in freely by residents and nonresi- dents. There is no limit on the amount of Syrian bank notes that may be brought into the country by residents and nonresidents. All Syrian nationals employed by Arab, foreign, or international organizations inside the Syrian Arab Republic and paid in fu ll or in part in foreign currencies are required to exchange all such earnings at authorized banks at the official exchange rate. With few exceptions, non-Syrian visitors to the Syrian Arab Republic are required to settle their bills at deluxe and first-class hotels w i th the counterpart of foreign currencies exchanged by them at authorized local banks at the tourist market exchange rate. Upon entering the country, all such visitors, other than nationals of Arab countries, are each required to convert a m in imum of US$100 into local currency at the tourist exchange rate. All Syrian Government employees working abroad and covered by the Security and Pension Act and the Social Security Act are required to repatriate and convert at the tourist market rate a m in imum of 25 percent of each year's pay and allowances received in foreign exchange. SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC Capital All inward and outward capital transfers by the public sector take place at the official market rate, while transactions by the private sector are determined by the Exchange Office of the Central Bank on a case-by-case basis. Imports of private funds in the form of foreign exchange are free for private individuals, whether residents or nonresidents. The export of capital requires the approval of the Exchange Office, as does most borrowing abroad. Order No. 265 of June 10, 1970 provides special facilities for the investment of funds of immigrants and of nationals of Arab states in the economic development of the Syrian Arab Republic. Investment guarantee agreements have been signed with France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Switzerland, and the United States. Immovable property in the Syrian Arab Republic may be acquired by nonresidents or foreign nationals other than resident Arab nationals only after presentation of evidence that the foreign exchange equivalent of the price of the property has been con- verted into Syrian pounds at an authorized local bank. Gold Residents may hold, acquire, and sell gold in the Syrian Arab Republic without restriction. Domestic transactions in gold take place at free market prices that are in line with free market prices abroad. Imports of gold are exempt from import licensing, but exports are subject to licensing. Proceeds from exports by residents must be surrendered. Exports of gold previously im- ported by nonresidents out of their resources abroad are subject to a repatriation commitment covering the cost of manufac tur ing and the profit earned. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement February 5. The tourist rate was depreciated LS 8.25 per US$1. September 9. A separate (selling) exchange rate of LS 11.25 = US$1 was introduced for travel and medical expenses abroad. to Imports and Import Payments January 75. The three lists of products importable by nonresident Syrians by means of drawing on their nonresident foreign currency accounts were supple- mented by an additional list. May 27. Importers who had been waiting to open letters of credit since November 1984 were authorized to make advance import deposits equal to 50 percent of import values; the remaining 50 percent should be settled when the import documents are received from the bank. July 3. An industrial list was established under which private sector manufacturing and crafts establishments were authorized to finance imports and spare parts with letters of credit or bills for collection granted under 180-day credit arrangements. 489 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC July 9. The four lists of commodities importable by nonresident Syrians by means of drawing on their nonresident foreign currency accounts were extended by an additional list. August 13. Authorization was granted for imports of certain agricultural products and equipment under 180-day credit arrangements. September 25. Advance import deposit requirements were unified at 50 percent for all private importers, and the arrangement for reimbursement of the differ- ence between the advance import deposit paid by importers in the case of imports effected under the November 1984 360-day credit facilities and the new unified 50 percent level was announced. In addition, authorization was granted for residents to import com- modities from the lists previously reserved for nonresi- dents; such imports could be financed with letters of credit or bills for collection against 360-day credit facilities. Exports and Export Proceeds May 25. All export proceeds that were previously subject to surrender partly at the official rate and partly at the parallel rate were made eligible for fu ll surrender at the parallel market rate. June 24. All proceeds from exports of fruit and vege- tables previously surrendered at the parallel rate were required to be surrendered at the tourist market rate. September 24. The list of export commodities, the proceeds from wh ich should be surrendered at the parallel exchange rate, was expanded; in this context, proceeds from exports of honey, alcohol, medical products, and cotton lint were made eligible for surren- der at the parallel market rate, instead of the official rate. December 30. It was announced that specified export products (covered under Decree No. 805 of April 22, 1981, as amended), which hitherto were subject to surrender at the parallel market rate, should henceforth be surrendered at the tourist market rate. 490 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TANZANIA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Tanzania is the Tanzania Sh i l l ing. On January 20, 1979 the fixed relationship of the Tan- zania shilling to the SDR was discontinued, and the Tanzania shilling was pegged to a basket of currencies of Tanzania's main trading partners. The Bank of Tanzania quotes daily buy ing and selling rates for the U .S. dollar. On December 31, 1985 the Bank of Tanzania's buy ing and selling rates for the shilling in terms of the U .S. dollar were T Sh 16.4147 = US$1 and T Sh 16.4148 = US$1, respectively. The buy ing and selling rates for other currenciesl are determined on the basis of appropriate cross rates in international markets. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control The Minister of Finance has delegated the administra- tion of exchange control to the Bank of Tanzania. In principle, authority for making payments abroad should be delegated by the Bank of Tanzania to the two authorized banks, the National Bank of Commerce and the People's Bank of Zanzibar. In practice, v ir tua l ly all outward payments have to be approved by the Bank of Tanzania; control over exchange operations in Zanzibar is exercised by the People's Bank of Zanzibar. On the mainland, import control is administered by the Imports Controller in the Bank of Tanzania, and export control, by the Exports Controller in the M in is try of Trade. The Bank of Tanzania acts as the registrar of exporters. The responsibility for issuing specific import and export licenses rests w i th the Controllers, to whom applications must be submitted by the importer or exporter in Tanzania before import orders are placed abroad or exports are shipped. Zanzibar administers an independent system of foreign trade controls through a Board of Trade; all imports and the principal exports are effected by the state-trading agencies (Bizanje and the Zanzibar State Trading Corporation). Prescription of Currency Settlements between residents of Tanzania and non- residents must be made either in convertible currencies or in Tanzania shillings by debit or credit to a Convert- ible Nonresident Account or Loro Account.

Accoun ts ma in- tained by nonresident Tanzanian na t iona ls and foreign nationals, who were norma l ly resident in Tanzan ia and have become nonresidents, are also treated as nonresi- dent accounts. Nonresident accounts are broadly divided into two categories: convertible and nonconver t ib le. Balances on convertible accounts are e l ig ib le for transfer from Tan- zania w i thout any fur ther scru t iny of, or approval by, the Bank of Tanzan ia. Balances on nonconvertible accounts may be transferred from Tanzan ia after ob ta in ing ap- proval from the Bank of Tanzan ia. In total, there are six subcategories of nonresident accounts, n am e ly, Exter- na l, Sh ipp ing /A i r l ine, Special, O rd ina ry, Expa tr ia te, and Unspec i f ied. Tanzanian na t iona ls and foreign na- tionals norma l ly resident in Tanzan ia, who have pro- ceeded abroad on vacation, emp loymen t, or for other purposes may ma in ta in both Special and Ordinary Accounts in the form of a current, savings, or deposit account, according to the option of the account holders. Imports and Import Payments Imports from South Afr ica are proh ib i ted. Some imports into the ma in land from any source may be prohibited for reasons of health or secu r i ty. Certain goods listed in the Import Control Notice of April 8, 1980, known as Open General License, are not being licensed; they may be freely imported, irrespective of country of origin, wh i le other goods not listed require specific licenses. For values not exceeding T Sh 10,000 in each case, imports not financed w i th off ic ial for- eign exchange do not requ ire licenses. A sem iannual foreign exchange p lan provides for ind ica t ive foreign exchange allocations for goods to be imported subject to specific licenses. A l though manu fac tu re rs are permitted to import many goods d irec t ly, the importation of specified goods is restricted to centralized import agen- cies. Unless spec if ica l ly exempted by the Bank of Tanzan ia, ind iv idual consignments of imports amoun t- ing to T Sh 20,000 or above are subject to compulsory preshipment inspection for qu an t i ty, q u a l i t y, and price comparison by the Societe Generate de Surveillance (SGS) of Geneva, acting as agent for the Government of Tanzania. All merchandise imports by the ma in land must be insured w i th the Na t ional Insurance Corporation of Tanzania unless exempted by the Bank of Tanzan ia, and prem iums must be paid in Tanzania sh i l l ing s. All imports into Zanzibar are made by B izan je. Most imports, irrespective of the ir o r ig in, are subject to sales tax at rates rang ing up to 50 percent of the c . i . f. va lue plus import du ty. (This tax is also payable on sales of domestic products .) There are arrears in respect of import paymen ts. 491 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TANZANIA Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to all countries are controlled and require the approval of the Bank of Tanzania. Noncitizens working in Tanzania under contract in salaried employment and with a firm commitment to leave Tanzania eventually may remit abroad, throughout their period of employment, up to one third of their monthly salary to cover family maintenance, savings, etc. Applications to remit more than one third of salary, or in excess of T Sh 6,000 a month, are considered on their merits by the Bank of Tanzania. The basic exchange allocations for tourist travel are no longer being granted. Family remittances by residents to relatives abroad have also been terminated. Travelers are allowed to take out up to T Sh 100 each in domestic currency. Nonresident travelers may take out foreign currency notes, traveler's checks, and letters of credit for any amount remaining out of the foreign exchange they brought in. Certain payments for invisibles are in arrears. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to South Africa are prohibited. On the mainland, exports of products handled by state-trading organizations and exports of certain other products are subject to controls and, if there is a local shortage, may be restricted. Exports for sale cannot be effected without an export license. All principal exports of Zanzibar are sold abroad by the Zanzibar State Trading Corporation. Exporters are required to be registered with the Bank of Tanzania and must maintain an account with a local commercial bank. Export proceeds must be collected in convertible currencies w i th in two months from the date of exportation. However, on application to the Bank of Tanzania this period may be extended. Export proceeds must be surrendered to an authorized bank upon their collection. Authorization is granted on a case-by-case basis for exporters to retain 10-100 percent of their foreign exchange earnings for the purpose of importing spare parts and other inputs. There is an export rebate scheme under which export- ers may claim rebates varying from 5 percent to 20 per- cent of the f .o .b. price of exports, depending on the commodities involved. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles must be sold to an authorized bank upon collection. Travelers may freely bring in convertible foreign currency notes; a returning traveler may bring in Tanzania shilling notes and coins exported on departure, up to T Sh 100. Capital Capital transfers to all countries are subject to control by the Bank of Tanzania and are restricted; all capital 492 transfers require individual exchange control approval. Persons leaving Tanzania permanently for settlement abroad, as a rule w i ll not be granted foreign exchange facilities. When, however, any person is unable to maintain himself and his dependents and has no ostens- ible means of livelihood in Tanzania, limited foreign exchange facilities may be granted by the Bank of Tanzania purely on compassionate grounds. Gifts to nonresidents require the prior approval of the Bank of Tanzania. There is no restriction on the investment of foreign funds in Tanzania, but to ensure eventual repatriation the investment should be recognized by the Bank of Tan- zania and a certificate of its status as an approved enterprise in terms of the Foreign Investment (Protec- tion) Act, 1963 should be obtained from the Ministry of Finance. Foreign and domestic investment in specified types of production require approval. All imports and exports of securities require approval. Approval is freely granted for the purchase of Tanzanian securities by nonresidents from residents, provided that payment is received in foreign exchange. The income from such securities is remittable, as are the proceeds from resale. Purchases of securities outside Tanzania by residents are not permitted. All loans or overdrafts from residents to nonresidents or to foreign-controlled resident bodies require approval by the Bank of Tanzania. Gold A commemorative gold coin is legal tender but does not circulate w i th in Tanzania. Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Tanzania for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized indus tr ial and professional users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form, other than jewe lry, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form, other than jewe l ry constitut- ing the personal effects of a traveler, are subject to ind iv idual licensing by the Bank of Tanzania. Import licenses for gold jewe lry are issued by the Bank of Tanzania and are available to goldsmiths on ly. Licenses are not granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, industrial users, and producers of new ly mined gold; imports are limited to an overall import quota.

Not for Redistribution THAILAND (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Thailand is the Thai Bah t. The external value of the baht is determined on the basis of the relationship of the baht to a weighted basket of currencies of Thailand's major trading partners as well as other considerations. The Exchange Equalization Fund announces daily the buy ing and selling rates for the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, for transactions be- tween itself and commercial banks; it also announces daily m in imum buying and max imum selling rates that commercial banks must observe when dealing with the public in deutsche mark, Hong Kong dollars, Japanese yen, Malaysian ringgit, pounds sterling, Singapore dollars, and U .S. dollars. On December 30, 1985 the middle official rate was B 26.65 = US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Bank of Thailand on behalf of the Ministry of Finance; the Bank delegates responsibility for most transactions to autho- rized agents ( i .e ., authorized banks and authorized companies1) and to authorized persons. All incoming exchange must be sold to an authorized agent. All outgoing payments are subject to approval (given auto- matically for bona fide commercial transactions and other current payments); certain inward capital transfers may also be subject to approval, upon prescription by Ministerial No t if ica t ion .2 Imports of gold require a license issued by the Ministry of Finance. Certain other imports and a few exports are subject to licensing by the Ministry of Commerce. Prescription of Currency There are no special requirements concerning the currency to be used for settlements w i th foreign coun- tries; most payments are made in U .S. dollars. Nonresident Accounts The Bank of Thailand encourages nonresidents to place foreign currency deposits w i th commercial banks in Thailand. No restrictions are placed on the opening of a foreign currency account as long as the funds originate abroad. Balances on such accounts may be transferred without formality or restrictions. A commercial bank may pay interest on such deposits at competitive rates. Among baht deposits with commercial banks, there are two types of nonresident baht accounts: Transferable Accounts and Blocked Accounts. In principle, transfers of baht to and from nonresident accounts require ap- proval; there are exemptions, however, for nonresident 'No authorized company existed by end-1985. 2No such notification has yet been issued. accounts of foreign diplomatic entities, international organizations based in Thailand, and Thai nationals temporarily abroad. Transferable Accounts may be credited freely with the proceeds from sales to authorized banks of foreign currency transferred from abroad, with amounts transferred from other Transferable Accounts, and w i th funds eligible for remittance abroad in foreign currency. Balances on Transferable Accounts are con- vertible into foreign currency at any time and may be debited freely for the purchase of foreign currencies for transfer abroad, for transfers to other Transferable Accounts, for payments in respect of exports, and for any other payments to residents. Funds that are not eligible for credit to a Transferable Account must be credited to Blocked Accounts. Transfers of baht from Blocked Accounts for the purchase of foreign currency, except for certain current payments, are subject to approval by the Bank of Thailand; approval is granted when no capital transfer on behalf of a Thai national is involved. Imports and Import Payments Most commodities may be imported freely, but import licenses are required for some commodities, and the import of certain other items is prohibited for protective and other reasons. All imports of goods originating in or shipped from South Africa are subject to licensing. Imports of tea leaf, tea dust, and skimmed milk are subject to a requirement that the importer purchase a proportionate quantity of the same type of goods pro- duced in Thailand. Payments for imports may be approved by authorized banks upon submission of documents; the specific approval of the Bank of Thailand, which is given for all bona fide transactions, is required for advance payments in excess of US$2,000 and for opening revolving letters of credit or letters of credit w i th an expiry date exceeding n ine mon ths. Importers must obtain, in addition to the usual documents, a "certificate of payment" from an authorized agent before imported goods exceeding B 20,000 in value can be cleared through customs; military equipment imported by the Ministry of Defense and certain minor categories of imports are exempt from this requirement. Certain goods are subject to temporary import surcharges. Payments for Invisibles There are no restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. Payments for invis- ibles require au thor iza t ion, wh ich is usua l ly given by an authorized bank or otherwise by the Bank of Thailand.

Apart from foreign travel, fam i ly maintenance abroad, educational expenses abroad, and import payments, authorized agents are permitted to approve applications for ex- change without supporting documents, provided that each payment does not exceed the equivalent of US$140. Authorized money changers are prohibited from selling foreign currency to the general public; their business of transacting foreign means of payment is restricted to the buy ing of foreign currency notes or traveler's checks payable in foreign currencies; all such proceeds must be sold to authorized banks w i th in seven days. For persons traveling abroad for pleasure or personal business trips, authorized agents may approve exchange allowances not exceeding the equivalent of US$875 for trips of less than seven days. For a trip of more than seven days, and on the condition that foreign currencies are taken in the form of traveler's checks, foreign notes, credit card allowances, and traveling letters of credit, daily expenses are allowed automatically up to a max- imum of 10 and 20 days for a trip with or without visa, respectively. With foreign currencies taken in other forms, such as drafts, a max imum of only US$875 is allowed automatically; for an amount of more than US$875, a formal request must be submitted to the Bank of Thailand. For business or official travel, US$175 a day is allowed, and additional foreign exchange not exceeding US$75 a day may be obtained in certain cases for entertainment expenses. Departing Thai tourists are subject to a tax at a rate of B 1,000 for a trip by air and B 500 for a trip by other means of transportation. For fam i ly remittances, authorized banks may sell US$200 a month to each transferor for Europe and the United States and US$150 a month for other countries. Amounts above these limits are approved by the Bank of Thailand upon verification. A person may take out local currency not exceeding B 500 (or B 1,000 for a fam i ly traveling on one passport), or foreign currency not exceeding US$250 for one person (US$500 for a family traveling on a single passport) or the equivalent in the form of notes and coins, w i thout the prior approval of the exchange control authorities. An amount above this limit, but not more than the allowed l im it according to the duration of travel, may be sold in other forms of foreign currencies, e .g ., traveler's checks. The resale of foreign currency to a person in transit is allowed, provided that the record of foreign currency sold to a commercial bank or authorized agent is shown, and that the purchase is not greater than the amount previously sold. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Afr ica are subject to licensing. Certain categories of exports are subject to licensing, and in a few cases, to prior approval, irrespective of 494 destination .3 All other commodities may be exported freely, except to South Afr ica. Settlement for exports of silver exceeding US$5,000 in value must be made through irrevocable letters of credit. The exporter is required to obtain a "certificate of exportation" from an authorized agent in order to clear the shipment through customs where shipments of tin or rubber exceed B 2,000 in value and, w i th minor exceptions, where exports of other goods exceed B 20,000 in va lue. Export proceeds must be collected and must be sold to an authorized agent w i th in 7 days of receipt; they must be surrendered w i th in 15 days from the date of export if payment is made by letter of credit, 21 days if a sight bill is drawn for collection, 15 days after the due date of a usance b i l l, or 15 days for other methods of paymen t, but in any case not later than 180 days after the date of export. Foreign tourists may freely take out precious stones and gold or platinum ornaments or other articles up to any value. The export of most types of rice and rice products and of sugar is subject to export levies referred to as export premiums. Proceeds from Invisibles All receipts from invisibles must be sold to an authorized agent. Authorized persons are allowed to purchase foreign currency notes and coin or traveler's checks payable in foreign currencies, but the latter must be resold to authorized banks. No person may bring into Thailand local currency exceeding B 2,000 w i thout a permit (or B 4,000 for a fam i ly traveling on one pass- port). Travelers may bring in any amount in foreign notes and coin. Capital All outward transfers of capital, inc lud ing premiums on life insurance policies, by residents or nonresidents are subject to approval. Personal capital exports by residents are restricted.

Purchases or sales of gold on commodity fu tures exchanges are prohibited. Imports and exports of gold other than jewelry are subject to the following arrangements, unless they are effected by or on behalf of the monetary authorities: commercial imports of gold in any form are restricted and require a license issued by the Ministry of Finance; for gold bu l l ion, the Ministry periodically fixes an authorized quan t i ty of imports. A bidding system operates under which the importer offering the highest premium by tender is awarded a license as sole importer of the authorized quantity for a certain period. In addition to this premium, which accrues to the Govern- ment, the importer is required to pay to the Ministry of Finance a fee at the rate of 2 percent of the c . i . f. value of the gold. Foreign tourists may take out gold ornaments up to any value. Exports of gold bullion are prohibited; traders' exports of gold ornaments exceeding B 5,000 in value require a certificate of exportation for presentation to the customs, but they are free of export duty or taxes.

Not for Redistribution TOGO (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Togo is the CFA Franc,1 which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. The official buying and selling rates are CFAF 50 = F 1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market and the fixed rate between the French franc and the CFA franc. The BCEAO levies a commission of 0.10 per mill on transfers from countries outside the West African Mone- tary Union and one of 2.50 per mill on transfers to such countries.2 Banks levy a commission on transfers to all countries outside the West African Monetary Union, part of which must be surrendered to the Treasury. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of measures relating to gold and the repatriation of export proceeds, Togo's exchange controls do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Cote d'lvoire, Equato- rial Guinea, Gabon, Mali, Niger, and Senegal). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, which also supervises borrowing abroad, the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Togo, inward direct investment and all outward investment, and the soliciting of funds in Togo for placement in foreign countries. Some of the approval authority in respect of exchange control has been delegated to authorized intermediaries and the BCEAO. The BCEAO is authorized to collect, either directly or through the banks, financial institutions, the Postal Administration, and offices of government minis- tries, any information necessary to compile balance of payments statistics. Forwarding and receipt of bank notes through the mail by authorized intermediaries is subject to control by the BCEAO. All exchange transac- tions relating to foreign countries must be effected through authorized banks, the Postal Administration, or the BCEAO. Import and export licenses are issued by the Foreign Trade Division in the Ministry of Commerce and 1 The CFA franc is issued by the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de 1'Quest (BCEAO) and is the common currency in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'lvoire, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo. 2 Transfers between member countries of the Union are subject to the flat commission of CFAF 100 levied on settlements between agencies of the BCEAO.

Prescription of Currency Since Togo is an Operations Account country, set- tlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other Operations Account country. Current payments in rela- tion to The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are normally effected through the West African Clearing House. Settlements with all other countries are usually effected through correspondent banks in France, in any of the currencies of those countries, or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. The crediting to nonresident accounts of CFA bank notes, French bank notes, or bank notes issued by any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account is not permitted, except for credits to Foreign Accounts held by foreign correspondents of authorized banks, which may be credited with BCEAO bank notes mailed direct to the BCEAO agency in Lome by those correspondents. Foreign Accounts in Francs may also be debited, without authorization, with BCEAO bank notes mailed by authorized intermediaries to their foreign correspondents through the BCEAO agency in Lome. Imports and Import Payments All imports of South African origin are prohibited. Imports from countries in the French Franc Area may be made freely, but require the prior authorization of the Foreign Trade Division in the Ministry of Commerce and Transport when valued at CFAF 10,000 or more and are for commercial purposes. Imports from all other coun- tries require individual import licenses when valued at CFAF 10,000 or more. In principle, the licenses are granted in accordance with an import program estab- lished each year; as yet, however, the program has not been established, and almost all requests for import licenses, irrespective of the origin of the goods, are granted. There is no formal free list. The issuance of import licenses for printed piece goods of Japanese origin is conditional, in principle, on the purchase of a specified quantity of the local product; in practice, this requirement is no longer enforced. The Socie"te* Nationale de Commerce (SoNACOM) has an import monopoly for sugar cubes, sugar in sachets, rice, flour, canned milk, soap for household use, salt, tobacco and tobacco products, corrugated iron, concrete reinforce- ment rods, and alcoholic beverages originating in foreign 497 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TOGO countries or having an alcohol content exceeding 35 degrees (Baume) and imported from the French Franc Area. Any other importer of soap is required to pay a monopoly tax of 5 percent of c . i . f. value, proceeds of wh ich are earmarked for SONACOM. All import transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value exceeds CFAF 500,000, w i th the exception of imports not involving sale of foreign exchange or financed through the Postal Administration, and certain imports of a special nature. Import licenses entitle importers to purchase the necessary exchange, spot, but not earlier than eight days before shipment if a documen- tary credit is opened, or on the due date of payment if the commodities already have been imported. Purchases of foreign exchange for down payment are subject to prior authorization by the Minister, which may be granted only on the date such payment is due and only for up to 30 percent of each transaction involving capital goods and 10 percent for other transactions. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to approval. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted by a general authorization when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresi- dents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also generally permitted. For tourist travel, residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may obtain an exchange allocation of an amount equivalent to CFAF 175,000 a person a trip (CFAF 87,500 for children under 10 years) for any number of trips a year; any foreign exchange in excess of CFAF 5,000 remaining after return to Togo must be surrendered within eight days of re-entry. For business travel, there is a special allocation of the equivalent of CFAF 20,000 a day, subject to a max imum of CFAF 400,000 a trip. The transfer of the entire net salary of a foreign national working in Togo is permitted upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher, residence permit, or work permit, provided that the transfer takes place w i th in three months of the pay period. Residents may at any time and without indicating the purpose of the transfer make payments abroad, through an authorized bank, up to CFAF 50,000 a transfer. Resident and nonresident travelers to foreign countries may take out up to a max imum of CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, and bank notes of other countries of the French Franc Area. Resident travelers to other countries of the French Franc Area may take out any amount in BCEAO bank notes, but if proceeding to a country that is not a member of the West African Monetary Union, they must declare to the customs the amount taken out if it exceeds CFAF 250,000. 498 Nonresident travelers may take out foreign bank notes and coin up to the amount declared by them on entry3 or, if no declaration has been made, up to the equivalent of CFAF 175,000. Nonresident travelers may also freely take out any amount of letters of credit and traveler's checks drawn in their names abroad. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to all countries require licenses. All exports to South Africa are prohibited. The Office Togolais des Phosphates (OTP) has a monopoly over the export of phosphates, and the Office des Produits Agricoles du Togo (OPAT) has a monopoly over the export of cacao, coffee, cotton, groundnuts, and certain other agricultural commodities. The due date for payment for exports to foreign countries, including the French Franc Area, may not be later than 180 days after the arrival of the goods at their destination, and the proceeds must be surrendered within a month after the due date; authorized diamond purchasing offices, however, may retain foreign cur- rency proceeds in foreign currency accounts with autho- rized banks in Togo. All export transactions relating to foreign countries, including the French Franc Area, must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value exceeds CFAF 500,000. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles transactions with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services, and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets, must be collected and surrendered within one month of the due date or the date of receipt. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BCEAO, the Bank of France, or any institute of issue maintaining an Opera- tions Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) of countries outside the French Franc Area. Residents bringing in foreign bank notes and foreign currency traveler's checks in excess of CFAF 5,000 must sell them to an authorized bank within eight days. Capital Capital movements between Togo and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the other countries of the French Franc Area are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require exchange control approval by the Minister of Economy and Finance and are restricted, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. 3This amount is adjusted for (1) the amount of foreign currency sold for CFA francs, and (2) any foreign currency acquired in Togo by (a) debit to a Foreign Account in Francs or a Foreign Account in Foreign Currency, (b) the conversion of foreign currency traveler's checks, etc., made out in the name of the traveler, and (c) any repurchases of foreign currency (permitted up to CFAF 175,000) w i th CFA francs resulting from the sale of foreign currency. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Special controls (additional to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable) are maintained over borrowing abroad, over inward direct investment and all outward investment, over the issuing, advertis- ing, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Togo, and over the soliciting of funds in Togo for placement abroad. Such operations require prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. Exempt from authorization, however, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Togolese Government, and (2) shares that are identical with, or may be substituted for, securities whose issuing, adver- tising, or offering for sale in Togo has already been authorized. With the exception of controls relating to foreign securities and the soliciting of funds in Togo, these measures do not apply to relations with France (as defined above), Monaco, member countries of the West African Monetary Union, and the Operations Account countries. There also are special controls applicable to all countries other than Togo with respect to imports and exports of gold. All investments abroad by residents of Togo require prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance;4 beginning June 24, 1981 at least 75 percent of such investments must be financed by foreign borrow- ing. Foreign direct investments in Togo5 must be declared to the Minister of Economy and Finance before they are made. The Minister has a period of two months from receipt of the declaration during which he may request postponement of the projects. The total or partial liquidation of any inward direct investment or any outward investment also requires prior declaration to the Minister of Economy and Finance. Both the making and the liquidation of investments, whether these are Togo- lese investments abroad or foreign investments in Togo, must be reported to the Minister of Economy and Finance and to the BCEAO within 20 days following each operation. Direct investments constitute invest- ments implying control of a company or enterprise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. Borrowing by residents from nonresidents requires prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans constituting a direct investment, which are subject to prior declaration, as indicated above; (2) loans contracted by authorized banks; (3) loans taken up either by industrial firms to finance operations abroad or by approved international mer- chanting houses to finance imports or exports; and (4) in Including investments made through foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in Togo and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Togo. 5 Including those made by companies in Togo that are directly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in Togo of foreign companies. TOGO certain circumstances, any other loans, provided that the outstanding amount for any one borrower does not exceed CFAF 100 million. The repayment of any foreign borrowing requires the prior authorization of the Minis- ter of Economy and Finance; exempt from this require- ment are loans constituting a direct investment, loans taken up by authorized banks, and any loans exempted by the Minister. Lending abroad is subject only to special authorization by the Directorate of Economy. Under the provisions of the general tax legislation, certain fiscal benefits are accorded to specified new investment (foreign and domestic) in both new and existing enterprises. In addition, certain enterprises, in accordance with their importance to the economic development of Togo, may be granted special privileges for a specified number of years relating to the mainte- nance of existing taxes and exemption from import duties. Such privileges are negotiated by the Govern- ment and the investor. An Investment Law, applicable to both foreign and domestic capital, sets out the types of enterprises that may be designated as "priority enterprises," provided that the head office is in Togo. Such firms may sign a special founding agreement by which they receive certain tax benefits. Firms that undertake to invest at least CFAF 25 million may receive a guarantee in respect of their taxation over a number of years. The law guarantees the right of free transfer abroad of capital invested in Togo and of all investment income therefrom. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Togo. Imports and exports of gold from or to any other country require prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the Treasury or the BCEAO; (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles); and (3) imports and exports by travelers of gold objects up to a combined weight of 500 grams. Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Changes During 1985 Imports and Import Payments August 13. The import monopoly of Societe Nationale de Commerce (SONACOM) was extended to include rice and sugar in sachets. August 23.

Not for Redistribution TONGA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Tonga is the Pa'anga (commonly referred to as the Tonga pa'anga), which has been pegged at par to the Australian dollar since Novem- ber 1976. Tonga has no central bank, and the authorities do not buy or sell foreign exchange. As a transitional arrangement, the Bank of Tonga quotes daily rates for eight other currencies1 on the basis of their respective values against the Australian dollar, the intervention currency. The spread between the Bank of Tonga's buying and selling rates is approximately 2 percent. Sales of foreign exchange are at a premium of approx- imately 1.5 percent and purchases are at a discount of approximately 0.5 percent. However, for export re- ceipts, the Bank buys foreign exchange at the midpoint rate, upon submission of documentary evidence that the foreign exchange is derived from export sales. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. On December 31, 1985 the buying and selling rates of the pa'anga were T$l .457 and T$l .486, respec- tively, per U .S. dollar. Administration of Control Tonga's trade and payments system is relatively free of regulation. Foreign exchange transactions are reg- ulated by the Bank of Tonga and the Ministry of Finance. Exchange regulations require the timely surren- der of export proceeds to the Bank of Tonga but this is not rigidly enforced. Prescription of Currency There are no regulations prescribing the currencies to be used in particular transactions. Imports and Import Payments Import licenses are normally issued freely, except for imports that are prohibited for health, safety, or environ- mental reasons.

Payments for Invisibles Tonga's system of exchange controls provides for specified limits on sales of foreign exchange for travel, education, and health purposes; such limits may be exceeded with the approval of the Ministry of Finance. The Bank of Tonga has discretionary authority to approve foreign exchange sales for travel expenses up to T$ 1,000 in any 12 months on submission of valid sea or air tickets. Shipping and airline agencies may remit fares and freights earned in Tonga on production of copies of returns forwarded to their respective head offices. Pay- ment for education and health purposes may be approved on submission of accounts, and there is no fixed limit for such foreign exchange sales. Exports and Export Proceeds Export proceeds must be surrendered to the Bank of Tonga within 90 days of shipment but these regulations are not rigidly enforced. There are no taxes or quantita- tive restrictions on exports, but coconut oil, copra, and bananas may be exported commercially only through the Tonga Commodities Board. Capital The authorities maintain a liberal attitude toward foreign direct investment, which so far remains small. Foreign investors are required to apply for a license, with approval depending on the type of investment. Investors are permitted a wide range of activities, but activities that complement domestic production, rather than com- peting with it, are generally preferred. Under the Industrial Development Incentives Act, foreign investors involved in manufacturing are allowed duty-free imports of capital inputs, a five-year tax holiday, and repatriation of profits and capital. Acquisition of financial assets abroad by Tongan residents is, in principle, not permitted. Changes During 1985 Imports and Import Payments July 1. The following changes in import tariff came into effect: (a) tariffs were raised on a range of items, mainly consumer goods; (b) the customs duty on salt, sugar, and flour was abolished; and (c) the customs duty on pigments was reduced from 15 percent to 10 percent. 500 ©International Monetary Fund.

The official buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar are TT$3.56853 and TT$3.63150, respectively, per US$1. An exchange rate of TT$2.40 = US$1 applies to imports of essential food items, Pharmaceuticals, certain agricultural inputs, and school books. On December 31, 1985 the official selling rate for the U .S. dollar in this preferential market was TT$2.42100 per US$1. Buying and selling rates for certain other currencies1 are also officially quoted, with daily quotations based on the buy ing and selling rates for the U .S. dollar in markets abroad. Administration of Control The authority to administer exchange control is vested in the Central Bank, acting as agent of the Government. The Central Bank exercises direct exchange control approval authority on imports of invisible items by requiring persons wishing to import such items to apply to the Central Bank, which will authorize in advance the amount of foreign exchange that will be made available for the importation of the specified item. Approval authority with respect to the approval of payment for visible imports has been delegated to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce; with respect to payments up to specified amounts for certain current invisibles, such authority has been delegated to authorized banks. The exchange control system provides for compulsory surrender of foreign currency2'3 and for control over both current and capital transactions. All overseas payments and transfers require the approval of the exchange control authorities; payments to South Africa are pro- hibited. Short-term credit transactions, such as the granting of credit, loan, or overdraft facilities by resident banks to nonresidents and local nonresident-controlled companies, are also subject to control. Notes issued by the East Caribbean Currency Author- ity and the Central Bank of Barbados are not legal tender in Trinidad and Tobago, but under an arrangement with the monetary authorities concerned, the notes are pur- chased by the monetary authorities and are repatriated by them in return for reciprocity of treatment with respect to 'Barbados dollars, Canadian dollars, deutsche mark, Eastern Carib- bean dollars, French francs, Guyana dollars, Jamaica dollars, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, and Swiss francs. 2Under Trinidad and Tobago's exchange control regulations, all currencies other than the Trinidad and Tobago dollar are considered foreign currencies. 3If the business of a trader, firm, or company involves frequent receipts and payments in foreign currencies, permission may be granted for the retention of a portion of receipts in a Foreign Currency Account, subject to the requirement that periodic statements of credits and debits to the account be submitted to the authorities. collections of Trinidad and Tobago dollars. From April 7, 1981 the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago no longer repatriates Trinidad and Tobago currency notes from the monetary authorities of the Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM) countries.4 Import and export licenses, when required, are issued by the Trade and Commerce Division of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Prescription of Currency Settlements may be made in U .S. dollars or in any other specified currency5 except South African currency. Authorized payments, including payments for imports, to all countries may be made in U .S. dollars or in any other specified currency. Payments from all countries with which trade is allowed must be received in U .S. dollars or in any other specified currency. Nonresident Accounts There are two types of nonresident accounts: External Accounts and Blocked Accounts. External Accounts may be opened by commercial banks for nonresidents of Trinidad and Tobago. These accounts may be credited with payments by residents of Trinidad and Tobago that have been approved by the exchange control authorities, with transfers from other External Accounts, and with proceeds from the sale of gold and foreign currencies to an authorized dealer. They may be debited for payments to residents of Trinidad and Tobago, for transfers to other External Accounts, and for purchases of foreign currencies. The funds in these accounts are treated as equivalent to External Accounts in U. S. dollars or any other foreign currency and may be transferred freely between residents of countries outside Trinidad and Tobago, with the exception that trans- fers from External Accounts held by residents of the CARICOM countries to any country outside Trinidad and Tobago other than that of the holder's residence are conditional upon the Central Bank being satisfied that the exchange control authorities of the holder's country of residence do not object. Blocked Accounts are normally credited with the balance of capital assets of persons who have emigrated from Trinidad and Tobago. The use of balances on Blocked Accounts is subject to authorization.

Trade with South Africa is prohibited, and all imports from Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, the Democratic Peo- ple's Republic of Korea, Poland, Romania, the U .S .S .R ., and Yugoslavia are subject to specific licens- ing, irrespective of the Negative List status of the import concerned. At present, trade with these countries may be settled in U.S. dollars. In principle, trade with CARICOM countries is to be effected through the CARICOM multilateral clearing facil- ity (CMCF). The domestic importer or exporter makes payments or receipts in domestic currency, with corre- sponding credits and debits recorded for the two coun- tries by the CMCF agent. Foreign exchange settlement is deferred until fixed semiannual settlement periods and is effected in U .S. dollars. Effective March 31, 1983, Trinidad and Tobago suspended the CMCF arrangement on the stated grounds of failure on the part of certain member states to settle outstanding balances. Imports from all other countries may be paid for in any currency in which the goods are satisfactorily invoiced. The main items that are subject to the Negative List include cement, clothing, corrugated iron sheeting, cosmetics, saccharin, coffee and cocoa beans, and completely assembled motor vehicles. Firearms, ammu- nition, and narcotics are either prohibited or rigidly controlled for security and health reasons. Certain food products are covered by the agricultural Marketing Protocol of the CARICOM Treaty. Imports of rice, oils, and fats are subject to state trading; rice is normally imported from Guyana at agreed prices.6 All imports of food and drugs must satisfy prescribed standards. Im- ports of meat, live animals, and plants are subject to specific regulation, as are imports of mining materials. All other commodities from all sources may be imported under open general license. Where specific import licenses are required they must be obtained from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce before orders are placed. Payments for all imports require exchange control approval. Annual foreign exchange sales for imports are guided by a foreign exchange budget for imports. The allocation criteria give priority to capital goods, raw materials, other industrial inputs, and essential food and drugs. 6Packaged rice may be imported through normal commercial channels, but such imports are not usua l ly allowed from countries other than Guyana unless the contracted supplies are not forthcoming. 502 Payments for Invisibles Payments for current invisibles require the specific approval of the authorities. Applications for foreign exchange must be supported by appropriate documentary evidence. No restrictions are imposed on payments for current international transactions, except with respect to South Africa. Under authority delegated by the Central Bank, the authorized banks may approve applications for foreign exchange within prescribed limits for certain transactions in invisibles. When additional amounts are needed, the approval of the authorities is required, which is granted, provided that unauthorized capital transfers are not involved. For outward remittances of gifts and donations, the commercial banks must obtain approval from the Central Bank. The basic allowance for tourist travel is TT$2,500 a person a year; for business travel, TT$350 a day for a max imum of 30 days for one trip; and for health care, TT$12,000 a year. Allowances for education abroad are TT$8,000 for schools, TT$12,000 for universities, and TT$ 1,200 for correspondence courses, and TT$700 once every two years for warm clothing. Residents and nonresidents may take out of Trinidad and Tobago notes up to the equivalent of TT$200. Travelers who are regarded as residents of Trinidad and Tobago may export part of their basic travel allowance up to a maximum of TT$1,200 in foreign currency notes. Nonresidents visiting Trinidad and Tobago may, on departure, take out foreign currency notes up to the amount brought in by them. Nonresidents leaving Trinidad and Tobago are allowed to reconvert Trinidad and Tobago dollar notes into foreign currency up to the equivalent of TT$ 1,200 upon showing evidence of having purchased such funds from authorized dealers. For sums in excess of TT$ 1,200, nonresidents must obtain exchange approval from the Central Bank. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. Exports of certain goods usually require an individual license. These include some foodstuffs, arms and explosives, animals, gold, and petroleum and petroleum products produced in Trinidad and Tobago, as well as specified products not produced locally. Exports of all other commodities are permitted by an open general license. In addition, general licenses may be issued at the discretion of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce; such licenses have been issued to permit petroleum companies and sugar companies to export w i thout specific licenses. The proceeds from sugar exports are subject to a tax, which varies on the basis of the price of the export sale. Purchases of petroleum and petroleum products from Trinidad and Tobago by other CARICOM countries are ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution aided by the provisions of the CARICOM Oil Facility established by the Government; the facility provides long-term, low-interest loans to finance the increase over the level on January 1, 1979 in the cost of oil imports from Trinidad and Tobago by other CARICOM countries. Exporters to Guyana are required to ensure that the Guyanese importers are in possession of appropriate approval documents issued by the Central Bank of Guyana, attesting to the availability of foreign exchange to make the necessary settlements. Export proceeds received in foreign currencies must be surrendered, but exporters of certain goods, notably petroleum, may be authorized to retain abroad a portion of their proceeds. In practice, the petroleum companies operating in Trinidad and Tobago repatriate all foreign exchange after providing for the equivalent of their local currency needs. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from current invisibles received in foreign currencies must be surrendered. Insurance, shipping, and similar companies operating in Trinidad and Tobago are usually authorized to maintain operating accounts for receipts and expenditures in foreign currency. These companies give periodic accounts of their exchange transactions to the authorities. Residents and nonresidents may bring into Trinidad and Tobago currency notes up to the value of TT$200. Foreign currency notes may be imported freely by residents and nonresidents. Capital Capital transfers from Trinidad and Tobago require approval and generally are restricted. However, repay- ment of commercial credits is permitted freely, and gifts to nonresidents and emigration allowances are approved up to specified limits; furthermore, as a matter of policy, capital transfers to other CARICOM countries are per- mitted liberally. Legacies may be expatriated in fu l l. However, the Central Bank reserves the right to phase remittances up to a maximum of four years. Certain international institutions may be permitted to borrow in Trinidad and Tobago on a case-by-case basis. For transactions in securities, 14 authorized de- positories have been appointed. Restrictions are placed on the import and export of all securities other than securities expressed in Trinidad and Tobago dollars. Contractual amortization of sterling securities is per- mitted, and also of mortgages and other loans if the original borrowing occurred prior to September 1939 or was subsequently approved by the exchange control authorities. Proceeds from the sale of securities or other invest- ments owned by nonresidents of Trinidad and Tobago may not ordinarily be transferred and are eligible for credit only to a Blocked Account (see section on Nonresident Accounts, above); however, approval is often given to residents to purchase such assets. All foreign investment, whether in cash or in kind, is TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO normally eligible for repatriation, provided it has been registered with the Central Bank. Hence, when funds are received for investment, local banks should authenticate the receipt of such funds from External Accounts. In the event of an appreciation in the value of the asset concerned, the remittance of any funds in excess of the original investment will normally be phased over a max imum of five years, depending on the balance of payments situation. Residents may transfer prescribed securities to persons resident outside Trinidad and Tobago, with the prior approval of the exchange control authorities, provided that the fu ll proceeds of sale are received in foreign currency. Foreign exchange is not normally provided for portfolio investment by residents in foreign securities, but when securities are sold or redeemed in a market outside Trinidad and Tobago, the proceeds may either be brought in and sold to an authorized dealer at the official market rate of exchange or, w i th the prior approval of the exchange control authorities, be invested outside Trinidad and Tobago in similar securities. Nonresidents may sell local securities, provided that the proceeds are credited to a Blocked Account or are reinvested in other local securities that are either ir- redeemable or are not redeemable within four years from the date of purchase. The laws of Trinidad and Tobago do not discriminate between nationals and foreigners in the formation and operation of companies in that country. Foreigners are required, however, to obtain a license under the Aliens (Landholding) Ordinance in order to hold an interest in real estate or to hold shares in local companies. Prospec- tive foreign investors must obtain approval for their project from the authorities in Trinidad and Tobago in order to be able to repatriate capital and capital gains. The Government has enacted basic incentive legisla- tion designed to attract domestic and foreign investment in manufacturing and in import-substitution industries. Since 1973 these policies have been effected within the framework of a CARICOM agreement on harmoniza- tion of fiscal incentives. Certain concessions are granted to industries declared to be pioneer industries, that is, industries that have not previously existed in Trinidad and Tobago or that are not being conducted on a commercial scale, or any industry for which there are favorable prospects for future development. Every pioneer manufacturer is entitled to temporary relief from import duties and taxes and to other privileges. There are limitations on the extent to which banks may grant finance to nonresident individuals and firms (other than residents of other CARICOM countries) and to nonresident-controlled local companies. Such companies are normally required to raise any local capital needed to supplement their assets by issuing either shares or bonds to residents of Trinidad and Tobago. Each commercial bank must maintain the monthly average of its net foreign exchange position within a specified quantitative ceiling. A commercial bank, as an authorized dealer, is allowed to hold an "open" asset or liability position in foreign exchange. However, the monthly average of its 503 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO net foreign exchange position must be maintained w i t h in specified quantitative ceilings. Gold Gold is defined by the Exchange Control Act of 1970 as gold coin and bu l l ion. The regulations provide tha t, except w i th specific exemptions and permissions granted by the Minister of Finance (1) one party to every transaction in gold between residents must be an autho- rized bank; (2) gold held by residents must be surren- dered to an authorized bank; and (3) gold may not be taken or sent out of Trinidad and Tobago. Residents are permitted in appropriate cases, however, to purchase, hold, or sell gold coins in Trinidad and Tobago for numismatic purposes. Control on the import and export of gold is adminis- tered by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Imports of gold jewelry are on open general license, but imports of gold other than jewelry are subject to specific import licenses issued by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce; such licenses are not normally issued except to the monetary authorities and authorized indus tr ial users. Exports of gold, whether jewelry or otherwise, are subject to specific export licenses issued by the M in is try of Industry and Commerce; such licenses for gold other than jewelry are not normally granted except to the monetary authorities. Imports of unrefined gold from non-CARicoM sources are subject to import du ty at 5 percent (preferential du ty) or 15 percent (general du ty ), and those of partly worked gold at 15 percent (preferen- tial du ty) or 25 percent (general du ty ). Such imports are free of purchase tax. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement December 18. The off ic ial exchange rate of the Trinidad and Tobago dollar was adjusted from TT$2.40 per US$1 to TT$3.60 per US$1, representing a deva lua- tion of 33.3 percent. (The rate of TT$2.40 - US$1 con t inued to apply to imports of essential food items, Pharmaceu t ica ls, certain agr icu l tural inpu ts, and school textbooks.) Imports and Import Payments January 1. As part of the 1985 budget, stamp duties were levied on import items other than food and drugs, at the rate of 6 percent of c . i . f. va lue on certain items and 12 percent on others. Payments for Invisibles January 9. A tax of 10 percent was imposed on sales of foreign exchange for tourist and business travel and for emigrants' remittances. December 18. The 10 percent tax on the sales of foreign exchange for tourist and business travel and for emigrants' remittances was abolished. Exports and Export Proceeds October 1. A regulation was introduced requiring exporters p lann ing to sell to Guyana to ensure that the Guyanese importer was in possession of appropriate approval documents issued by the Bank of Guyana, attesting to the ava i lab i l i ty of foreign exchange to make the necessary settlements. 504 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TUNISIA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Tunisia is the Tunisian Dinar. The exchange value of the dinar is determined in accordance with a basket of currencies. The buying and selling rates for foreign currencies1 are fixed daily by the Central Bank of Tunisia. On December 31, 1985 the spot buy ing and selling rates of the dinar were D 0.09978 and D 0.10078, respectively, per F 1; and D 0.7532 and D 0.7607, respectively, per US$1. Since February 1, 1979, forward quotations are provided daily for the deutsche mark, the French franc, and the U .S. dollar.2 The buying and selling rates of authorized banks are identical w i th those of the Central Bank. With specified exceptions, sales of foreign bank notes and traveler's checks are subject to a tax of 0.5 percent. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Central Bank; some authority over payments for imports and invisibles is delegated to the authorized banks. Foreign trade control is administered by the Commerce Directorate of the Ministry of National Economy, which determines, in consultation with the Central Bank, the Industry Direc- torate, and other concerned ministries the imports and exports that are to be prohibited or liberalized as well as the imports that are to be subject to quotas in accordance with the Government's overall program and the trade agreements with foreign countries. The Directorate, in collaboration with the Central Bank, issues import and export licenses. Prescription of Currency Settlements between Tunisia and foreign countries are made in convertible currencies quoted by the Cen- tral Bank (see footnote 1) or in convertible Tunisian dinars through Foreign Accounts. Settlements between Tunisia and Morocco, and certain settlements between Tunisia and Algeria, may be effected through accounts in the national currencies concerned at the central banks. Payments to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dinars may be opened freely by all nonresidents regardless of national- ity. These accounts may be credited freely w i th dinar 1 Currencies quoted spot and at bank note rates are Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Kuwaiti dinars, Moroccan dirhams, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Saudi Arabian riyals, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, U .A .E. dirhams, and U .S. dollars.

They may be debited freely for payments of any kind in Tunisia (irrespective of the country of residence of the payer), for transfers to other Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dinars, and for the purchase of any foreign currency from the Central Bank. Such currency may be transferred abroad or remitted in Tunisia to the account holder or to any other nonresident beneficiary. Foreign Accounts in Convertible Foreign Currencies may be established by nonresidents without authoriza- tion. They may be credited with convertible foreign currencies remitted to the account holder by a nonresi- dent, w i th foreign currency purchased from the Central Bank by debit of a Foreign Account in Convertible Dinars, with authorized payments by residents in favor of the account holder, with interest payable by the authorized intermediaries on foreign exchange deposits in the accounts whenever they can use the funds thus deposited at remunerative rates, with the proceeds from the cashing of checks, traveler's checks, or drafts expressed in convertible currencies and made out by a nonresident to the order of the account holder, and with foreign bank notes declared to customs. The accounts may be debited at any time for the sale of foreign currency to the Central Bank, for transfers to any Foreign Account, for transfer abroad, or for delivery of foreign currency to the account holder or any other nonresident beneficiary. Capital Accounts may be opened in the name of a resident of any foreign country. The opening of a Capital Account by a nonresident of Tunisian nationality or his spouse must be authorized by the Central Bank. Foreign banks may hold global Capital Accounts for their nonresident customers. Subject to certain conditions, Capital Accounts may be credited, without prior ap- proval of the Central Bank, with the proceeds of the sale on the stock exchange, or of the contractual or advance redemption, of Tunisian securities, the sales proceeds of real estate or rights to real estate situated in Tunisia, and with funds from another Capital Account. Irrespective of the account holder's country of residence, Capital Accounts may be freely debited for living expenses in Tunisia of the account holder and his fam i ly, up to D 100 a person a week, provided that total withdrawals from one or more Capital Accounts in a calendar year do not exceed D 2,000 a fam i ly. In addition, a Capital Account holder traveling in Tunisia between November 1 and March 31 may withdraw from such an account an amount equal to the foreign exchange imported for the trip and surrendered to the Central Bank of Tunisia, an 505 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TUNISIA authorized intermediary, or a subagency, provided that total withdrawals for the l iv ing expenses of the account holder or his fam i ly do not exceed D 2,000 a year. Such accounts may also be debited, subject to certain condi- tions, for expenses connected with the management of Tunisian securities, the maintenance, repair, and insur- ance of real estate and all taxes, and for transfer to the credit of another Capital Account. Subject to certain conditions, they may also be debited to assist the account holders' parents and offspring residing in Tunisia at a max imum rate of D 50 a person a month. These accounts may not be overdrawn. Balances held by physical persons of foreign nationality and not exceeding D 1,000 on December 31, 1973 or D 2,000 on May 31, 1975 are transferable abroad. Physical and juridical persons of French nationality holding Capital Accounts may trans- fer up to D 2,000 of balances belonging to them in each such account as of October 25, 1980. Furthermore, balances outstanding on October 31, 1980 can be used up to December 31, 1985 for the purchase of five-year government bonds, when the amount utilized is not greater than D 10,000, and seven-year government bonds with funds utilized over and above that amount. Interest payments and repayments on maturing bonds are transferable through an authorized intermediary. Internal Nonresident Accounts are used by natural persons of foreign nationality staying temporarily in Tunisia and receiving income in dinars there; these accounts may be opened freely, but balances may be used only in Tunisia. Internal Nonresident Export Accounts may be credited with the salaries of nonresident foreign nationals em- ployed in enterprises authorized under Decree-Law No. 85-14 of October 11, 1985. Special Dinar Accounts. Nonresident foreign enter- prises holding contracts in Tunisia are authorized freely to open, for each contract, a single special account in dinars for deposit of the portion of the contract price payable in dinars to cover their local expenses. Such accounts may also be credited with funds from a Foreign Account in Convertible Dinars, the dinar equivalent of foreign currency drawn on a Foreign Account in Con- vertible Foreign Currency, the dinar equivalent of any transfer in convertible foreign currency from abroad, and interest accruing on funds deposited in the account. The account may be freely debited for the enterprise's contract-related expenses in Tunisia. Any transfer operations from such accounts must be authorized by the Central Bank of Tunisia. Suspense Accounts are used for crediting all proceeds accruing in Tunisia to nonresidents where such proceeds are awaiting utilization in Tunisia for specified purposes or central bank approval for transfer abroad or transfer to other nonresident accounts. Subject to certain condi- tions, Suspense Accounts may be debited, without the prior authorization of the Central Bank, in respect of purchases of Tunisian securities, subscriptions to issues of short-term debentures or bonds, portfolio manage- ment expenses in respect of certain securities, payments 506 to the Tun is ian Government or public institutions, and settlement of l iv ing expenses incurred in Tunisia by the account holder or his fam i ly up to D 100 a person a week, provided that the total withdrawals in any calendar year from one or more accounts do not exceed D 2,000 a fam i ly. In addition, a Capital Account holder traveling in Tunisia between November 1 and March 31 may withdraw from such an account an amount equal to the foreign exchange imported for the trip and surrendered to the Central Bank of Tunisia, an authorized intermediary, or a subagency, provided that total withdrawals for the l iv ing expenses of the account holder or his family do not exceed D 2,000 a year. Physical persons of foreign nationality may transfer abroad assets that they hold if these did not exceed D 1,000 on December 31, 1973 or D 2,000 on May 31, 1975. Physical or juridical persons of French nationality holding Suspense Accounts may transfer up to D 2,000 of balances belonging to them in each such account as of October 25, 1980. In addition, the balances of foreign suspense accounts closed out as of October 3 1 , 1 9 80 that meet the conditions for being converted into capital accounts may be used until the end of 1985 to purchase five-year government bonds if the funds used do not exceed D 10,000 and for the purchase of seven-year government bonds if the funds used should exceed this amount. All other debits to these accounts require the authorization of the Central Bank. Foreign Currency Savings Accounts may be main- tained with the Postal Administration in the names of Tunisian natural or juridical persons who are resident abroad. These accounts may be credited with the countervalue in dinars of convertible foreign currency transferred by the account holder by check or postal transfer. They may be debited freely. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Israel and South Africa are pro- hibited. A system of import controls is applied under which there are different procedures for different oper- ators (manufacturers, traders, and state monopolies) and special procedures for specified categories of transac- tions (e .g ., export firms, and imports without payment from official foreign exchange). All imports other than specified items require prior authorization. Imports not subject to prior authorization require import certificates, which are cleared through commercial banks upon presentation of a commercial contract and copied and sent to the Central Bank for monitoring purposes. The freely importable products are listed in Annex I of the Notice to Importers and Exporters, published in the Official Gazette No. 75 of November 27, 1981, with subsequent amendments. The list contains many spare parts importable by industries for their own use. Imports of goods not classified as freely importable require either an annual import authori- zation or a specific import license. The approval of applications for licenses is handled by the Commerce Directorate of the Ministry of National Economy, in consultation with the Central Bank and, if necessary, the ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution appropriate technical ministry (Agriculture, Indus try, etc.). An "annual import authorization" is available to industrialists and agencies responsible for providing the country with certain staples or industrial products; approvals are not transferable between enterprises. Each industrialist must submit a detailed document, giving information not only on expected import requirements for the following year and the actual consumption of imported or domestically produced inputs in the previous year, but also on sales, production, employment, import prices, and the f irm's financial position. Annual import authorizations are given for a global l im i t, expressed in dinars; they are valid for one year w i th an automatic extension of the portion unused on December 31 of that year for an additional one-year period. Importers may make changes among the products specified in their import authorizations, provided that such a change does not reduce their planned purchase of domestically pro- duced inputs. For their requirements, traders must obtain import licenses that are valid for six months, but may be extended for a three-month period with approval of both the Commerce Directorate and the Central Bank. A subsection of the licensing system is in the form of "traders' quotas," applicable to some 35 commodity groups, with special emphasis on consumer durables. Quotas are allocated on a "points system," with the most important criteria relating to firm size (employment and turnover, the latter differentiating between sales from imports and those from domestically produced goods). Geographical location, the degree of specialization, and the age of the firm, are also considered in the allocation process. To meet urgent needs for their exclusive use, import- ers in particular sectors of economic activity (mainly industry and agriculture) can obtain "importer's cards" to cover goods up to a limit of D 500 a year for each importer. The limit has not been raised for a number of years, and few importers currently use this option. State-trading organizations are the exclusive importers of about one fourth of the total value of imports, some 50 percent of which are in the form of energy products. Among the important public-trading agencies are the Commerce Office (for sugar, coffee, tea), the Office des Cereales (grains), Ellouhoum (meat), and the Office National de 1'Huile (vegetable oil). In addition, certain food items, beverages, tobacco, and medical products are imported exclusively by other state agencies. The state-trading commissions meet periodically to decide on the appropriateness and timing of imports of specified products. For items that are not on the free list, state trading agencies are required to complete the same licensing formalities as those applicable to the private sector. Manufacturing industries producing exclusively for export and covered by Law No. 72-38 may import freely any goods required for their production process, subject only to customs declaration. In specified cases, imports TUNISIA destined for domestic investment projects are eligible for f u ll or partial exemption from import du ty. Importers must have received a customs code number as a prior condition for obtaining an import certificate, an import authorization, an import license, or an importer's card. All import documents invo lv ing payments must be domiciled w i th an authorized bank. Foreign currency may be purchased from the Central Bank or a delegated commercial bank for all payments that have received prior authorization. Resident importers are authorized to buy forward foreign currencies required for future settlement of their merchandise imports, for a max imum term of six months, at rates established daily by the Central Bank. In addition to customs duties, a number of import taxes are applied, the most important being a 5 percent tax to cover customs formalities. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require the approval of the Central Bank; for some transactions this authority has been delegated to the authorized banks. Payments for a number of current inv is ib les are freely approved, provided that they are properly documented. These include (1) various payments related to interna- tional trade (e .g ., port services, warehousing, commis- sions, and brokerage); (2) payments for processing, repair, assembly, royalties, patents and trademarks, taxes, fines, and court expenses; and (3) payment of interest and amortization arising from authorized con- tractual obligations to nonresidents. Approval is also given freely for remittance of dividends due to nonresidents. In addition, exporters holding balances on EFAC accounts (see section on Exports and Export Proceeds, below) may use these up to fixed limits for expenditures abroad in connection w i th participation in international trade fairs, and to pay customs duties and various other expenses related to exports. Exporters, hotel owners, travel agencies, and other external service industries may use EFAC balances freely for expenses related to publicity abroad, and up to fixed limits for certain other expenses. Nonresident enterprises producing for export w i th in the framework of Law No. 72—38 may freely make all their payments abroad; amounts in convertible dinars credited to the Business Travel Accounts of resident firms covered by Law No. 72-38 may be freely transferred up to D 6,000 a year for business travel; amounts unused over two consecutive years may be carried over, provided that the total of such transfers does not exceed D 10,000 in any one year. A business travel allocation may be authorized by the Central Bank for industrialists and businessmen whose professional activity requires travel abroad and who are unable to open EFAC accounts or business travel accounts based on Law No. 72-38. The annual alloca- tion for each beneficiary is in i t ia l ly determined by the Central Bank at the time of approval, taking into account the applicant's import turnover. In the years thereafter, the annual amount of the allocation is determined by the 507 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TUNISIA authorized intermediary w i th wh ich the authorization is domiciled, us ing the same criteria. Payments for certain other current inv is ib les are approved up to fixed l im i ts. Residents traveling abroad as tourists are entitled once a year to an exchange allocation equivalent to D 100 a person (D 50 for children under ten). Residents are en t i t led to a tourist allocation of 1,000 Moroccan dirhams for travel to Morocco. The monthly foreign exchange allowance for educational expenses abroad is the equ iva lent of D 250 for those s tudy ing in Canada and the Un i ted States, D 200 for students in Western European countries, and D 140 for those in other countries. A foreign na t ional employed under contract may transfer up to 50 percent of his net wage or salary without l im it if his f am i ly is not resident in Tunisia and subject to a max imum of D 150 a month if his fam i ly lives in Tun is ia .3 Foreign experts employed by the pub l ic sector may transfer abroad the ir monthly salaries up to the l im i ts specified in their contracts. Foreign salaried workers born in Tun is ia may transfer 30 percent of their net basic salaries, up to D 80 a month. Regardless of nationality, residents traveling abroad by air or sea are subject to a travel tax of D 45 a trip. Nonresidents, diplomats, persons traveling under the "Agence de Cooperation Technique," emigrant workers, students, pilgrims to Mecca, and those traveling for medical reasons are exempted from the tax. The export of Tunisian dinar bank notes or coin is prohibited. Unless central bank permission is obtained, the reconversion of domestic bank notes by nonresident travelers is restricted to 30 percent of the amount of foreign currency previously sold, subject to a max imum of D 100, if the traveler's stay in Tun is ia exceeds 24 hours; if it does not exceed 24 hours, there is no limitation on the reconversion. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Most exports are liberalized, but certain nonenergy exports (amounting to about 12.5 percent of the total in 1984) require export licenses issued by the Ministry of National Economy. The export of wine is the monopoly of the Office du V in; the export of cereals, that of the Office des Cereales; and the export of olive oil, that of the Office National de THu i le. With the exceptions noted below, all export proceeds must be repatriated and surrendered, normally within 10 days from the date payment is due if no credit is extended or, unless special authorization from the Central Bank is obtained, w i th in 100 days after shipment if the goods are sold on credit. Central Bank approval for a surrender period of up to 180 days is freely obtainable. Resident exporters may sell forward for a max imum term of three months, through authorized intermediaries, foreign currencies representing the proceeds from their merchandise ex- 3There are special regulations for those employed by nonresident manufacturing enterprises covered by Law No. 72-38. 508 ports. Exporters, hotel owners, travel agencies, and all providers of services abroad may arrange to credit part of the ir export proceeds to special EFAC (Exportations- Frais Accessoires} accounts denominated in convertible d inars. For exporters the l im i ts are 4 percent if export proceeds are repatriated more than 30 days after ship- ment of the merchandise, and 6 percent if repatriation occurs w i t h in 30 days fo l low ing sh ipmen t. Hotel own- ers, travel agencies, and other external services indus- tries may credit to such accounts up to 4 percent of their foreign exchange proceeds. Authorized intermediaries may grant surety bonds and performance bonds to resident exporters and to resident exporting enterprises eligible under Law No. 72-38. Resident manufacturing industries that produce exc lu s ive ly for export and are approved under the terms of Law No. 72-38 may arrange to credit 2 percent of their repatriated convertible currency export proceeds to Bus iness Travel Accounts in Convertible Dinars. Under the provisions of Law No. 72 —38, nonresident manu fac tu r ing enterprises ( i . e ., enterprises whose capi- tal is held by nonresidents and has been constituted to the extent of at least 66 percent through the import of convertible currencies) producing exc lus ive ly for export are exempt from the requirement of repatriation and surrender of export proceeds. Proceeds from Invisibles Residents must repatriate and surrender all amounts derived from services rendered to persons resident abroad and also all other income or proceeds from inv is ib les received from foreign countries. However, there are certain EFAC fac i l i t ies for such proceeds (see section on Exports and Export Proceeds, above). Foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) may be brought in freely; nonresident travelers w ish ing to re-export the equ iva lent of over D 500 must make a currency declaration upon entry. The import of Tunisian dinar bank notes and coin is prohibited. Capital All nonresidents who wish to invest in Tunisia are required to obtain the prior approval of the Tunisian authorities in order to be able to transfer the principal of, all current earnings from, such investments. Foreign investment in Tunisia may obtain the benefits provided for by the Investment Code (Law No. 69 —35), by Law No. 81 —56 providing incentives for investment in manufac tur ing industry and for industrial decentraliza- t ion, by Law No. 82—67 of August 6, 1982 providing incentives for investment in the agricultural and fishery sectors, and by Law No. 84-20 concerning export trad- ing companies.

Furthermore, Law No. 72-38 provides for various special benefits for nonresident manufac tur ing ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution enterprises, including an exemption from the repatriation requirement in respect of export proceeds. Under Law No. 85-108 of December 6, 1985, concerning incentives for financial and banking establishments conducting business essentially w i th nonresidents, the field of activity of such institutions has been extended; and they are authorized to exchange cash and traveler's checks for their nonresident customers and to engage in bank ing and exchange operations w i th residents, in particular by providing foreign exchange financing for foreign trade operations, investing their own foreign exchange re- sources in equities of resident enterprises, and accepting funds from residents that could be used to finance productive activities in Tunisia. Foreign nationals who have been residents of Tunisia and have left Tunisia permanently are entitled to the transfer of the following: 50 percent of their assets (with a m in imum of D 1,750 and a max imum of D 3,500) for those who left Tunisia before August 20, 1970;4 D 4,000 for those who left between August 20, 1970 and December 31, 1973; D 5,000 for those who left between January 1, 1974 and December 31, 1974; D 10,000 for those who left after December 31, 1974; D 15,000 for those who left Tunisia after December 31, 1978, are over 60 years of age, and are Tunisian nationals; and D 25,000 for those of French nationality residing and working in Tunisia as of October 25, 1980 and who subsequently retired and left Tunisia permanently after that date. Italian citizens who have left Tunisia and who hold Capital or Suspense Accounts are authorized to transfer their holdings up to the total amount specified under the Tunisian-Italian Agreement. All capital transfers by residents and all loans to nonresidents require the approval of the Central Bank. Donations or the proceeds from inheritances accruing to nonresidents are credited to Capital Accounts under certain conditions. The amortization of loans taken up with central bank approval from nonresidents is freely transferable. Gold Five denominations of commemorative gold coin are legal tender but do not circulate. Residents may acquire and hold gold in any form in Tunisia. The Central Bank has a monopoly over the import and export of monetary gold. Other imports of gold require joint authorization by the Central Bank and the Ministry of National Economy. Only dentists and specified cooperatives of industrial users are eligible to purchase gold from the Central Bank. The export of gold is prohibited. Changes During 1985 Nonresident Accounts February 11. A special facility was established for the deposit and withdrawal of foreign bank notes to or from 4Such persons may transfer D 1,750 if the total amount of the ir assets does not exceed D 3,500.

October 11. In replacement of Law No. 72-38 of April 27, 1972, Decree-Law No. 85-14 was issued, specifying, inter alia, the regulations governing internal nonresident export accounts. Imports and Import Payments April 25. Authorization was granted for equipment, products, and raw materials for use in the exploration of renewable energy sources to be imported free of du ty. June 28. It was announced that goods destined for re- export would benefit from s imp l if ied import procedures and would thus no longer require import licenses. In addition, import formalities were simplified for imports up to a value of D 20,000 of raw materials, semifinished products, spare parts, and equipment without use of official foreign exchange ( i .e ., financed from sources outside the coun try), provided that such imports were needed for production by the importer. The value limitation would not apply to imports of investment goods for industrial, agricultural, and tourism projects approved by investment agencies. Products and equip- ment similar to articles produced in Tunisia (including energy products, lubricants, and automobiles) and goods imported by state monopolies were exempted from the simplified import procedures. In addition, the limit on personal imports by Tunisians returning from abroad was raised from D 200 to D 300 a year. July 15. All import items, other than those included in a specified free list (the latter including mainly medical and pharmaceutical products and spare parts not pro- duced locally), were made subject to import licensing. July 26. A regulation was introduced discontinuing the practice under which imports of capital goods for projects approved by investment agencies could be effected under the import certificate procedure; such im- ports consequently became subject to prior autho- rization. Payments for Invisibles June 28. The daily foreign exchange allowance withdrawable out of EFAC accounts for business travel abroad without the requirement of justification was doubled to D 100. June 28. The annual l im it on debits to EFAC accounts to cover foreign travel was raised from D 4,000 to D 5,000-D 25,000, depending on the value of the enterprises' exports. In addition, the allowable level of commissions payable out of these accounts was raised from 3 percent to 5 percent of the f .o .b. value of exports of traditional products; for enterprises exporting new products or products to new markets, up to 8 percent could be paid in commission and up to 25 percent of such commissions could be credited to the enterprise's EFAC account. 509 ©International Monetary Fund.

In replacement of Law No. 76—63, Law No. 85 —108 was issued, extending the operational scope of foreign f inanc ial and banking institutions conducting business w i th nonresidents. 510 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TURKEY (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Turkey is the Turkish Lira. The authorities of Turkey do not observe margins in respect of exchange transactions, and Turkey follows a flexible exchange rate policy under which exchange rates for the lira quoted by the Central Bank are adjusted on a daily basis. Commercial banks are free to establish their own buying and selling rates. On December 31, 1985 the Central Bank's official buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were LT 574.00 = US$1, and LT 579.71 = US$1, respectively. Administration of Control Exchange and trade controls are the responsibility of the Prime Ministry, to which the Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade is attached. Administration of exchange controls has been delegated to the Central Bank, which regulates all matters related to foreign exchange operations. Fifty commercial banks have been authorized by the Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade to engage in foreign exchange operations on their own account, including allocating foreign exchange for imports not subject to prior permit. In the case of imports subject to prior permit, authorized commercial banks directly allocate foreign exchange and issue import licenses upon receiving the approved im- port permit from the Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade. Export registration is carried out by professional organizations, according to instructions from the Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade; the Undersecretariat also issues export licenses but may delegate this authority to the professional organizations. Prescription of Currency and Nonresident Accounts Settlements under bilateral payments agreements are made in U .S. dollars. Certain commercial transac- tions w i th Czechoslovakia, Iraq, Libya, Malta, Poland, Romania, Tunisia, and the U .S .S .R ., and with the other members of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) are made through special accounts denominated in U .S. dollars. Settlements with all other countries are made in convertible currencies. Nonresidents as well as residents may open accounts denominated in foreign exchange w i th commercial banks authorized to deal in foreign exchange; such accounts are disposable at the discretion of the holders. Imports and Import Payments All goods are freely importable except those explicitly prohibited or subject to prior permit. The current import regime consists of two lists of goods: (1) The first list ("Negative" list) includes 245 items, which may be imported only with specific authorization (prior permit) from the Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade; it consists ma in ly of raw materials, spare parts, intermediate goods and tools for industry, and electrical equipment. (2) The second list ("Fund" list) includes items under more than 100 tariff lines that can be freely imported w i th payment of a special levy (in most cases specific) in addition to customs duties; this list is chiefly made up of luxu ry consumer goods. The importation of all goods not included in either of the above lists is freely permitted w i th payment of customs duties, with the exception of import items already prohibited by specific laws (i.e., narcotics, weapons, ammunitions, and weapon components). However, importsVof sold, used and reconditioned, defective, substandaroK soiled, or poor quality goods may only be made witrr-special permission given by the Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade; when such goods are needed for a project, permission may be given by the State Planning Organization. Imports from countries where foreign trade is nationalized may only be carried out by the public sector for its own needs, or by individual companies with annual earnings of at least US$50 mil- lion. All imports by the public sector have to be authorized by the Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade. All commercial imports require import licenses, which are valid for six months. The validity of an import license may be extended by an authorized commercial bank for up to 12 additional months and can be further extended by the Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade. Import licenses are issued to registered importers, industrialists, state economic enterprises, and government departments. In the case of freely import- able items, including those in the "Fund" list, no special permit is required to apply for an import license to any authorized bank. In the case of imports subject to special permit, import licenses are issued by the Central Bank or any authorized bank upon approval granted by the Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade.1 The import license permits the necessary foreign exchange payment to be made. Payments for imports may be made against letters of credit, documents, or goods ( i .e ., upon customs clearance), or by way of acceptance credits; partial prepayments are authorized under certain condi- tions. Under the new import regime, restrictions con- cerning means of import payment have been reduced; the requirement to prepay in local currency the equivalent of the foreign exchange value of a letter of credit applica- tion has been eliminated; the obligation to deposit 20 percent of the local currency counterpart of the consignment at the time of applying for an import license 'The requirement under the previous regime of prior approval from other ministries in the case of imports subject to special licensing has been e l im ina ted, w i th the exception of imports of medicines, pes- ticides, or raw materials used in their production, wh ich are subject to control by the Ministry of Health and Social Aid, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Rural A f fa i r s, respectively. 511 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TURKEY in the case of payment against goods has been abolished; and restrictions previously imposed on import financing through acceptance credits have been eliminated. Guarantee deposits must be made by the importer before the import license is issued, and are refunded after the goods are cleared through customs and the foreign payment has been made; these deposits do not earn interest. The general guarantee deposit rate is 3 percent of the foreign exchange requested, which is applicable to imports by commercial importers. A special rate of 1 percent is applicable to industrialists' own import requirements, public sector imports, imports financed through acceptance credits, imports by foreign trade joint stock companies, and imports based on an incentive certificate. Imports for the Izmir International Fair are exempt from the guarantee deposit requirement. Export- ers who make use of their own foreign exchange accounts to pay for imports not subject to prior authori- zation are exempted from placement of guarantee de- posits; they are also exempted from this requirement for up to the equivalent of 20 percent of the foreign exchange held in such accounts in the case of imports subject to prior authorization. Regulations concerning imports without allocation of foreign exchange by the banking system mainly affect imports of goods for personal or professional use by travelers domiciled in Turkey, temporary imports by foreign contractors and diplomats, and imports by Turkish workers employed abroad and maintaining foreign exchange accounts with the Central Bank. Customs duties range mostly up to 15 percent in the case of raw materials, between 10 and 30 percent for intermediate and semifinished products, and between 30 and 40 percent for finished goods; higher rates apply to a number of luxury consumer goods. Imported goods are also subject to (1) a municipal tax of 15 percent of the applicable customs duty; (2) a stamp duty of 4 percent of the declared value; (3) a quay duty of 5 percent on the sum of c . i . f. value, customs du ty, municipal tax, and customs clearance expense. In addition, goods under the Fund list are subject to special import levies set by the Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade; most of these levies are set on a specific basis. A 5 percent import surcharge is levied on certain iron, steel, and plastic products from the European Community. Payments for Invisibles Specific Central Bank authorization is required only for a limited type of operation; all other invisible transactions are handled by commercial banks within norms issued by the Central Bank. Foreign exchange is in general granted liberally, provided that requests are accompanied by specific documentation. The following operations are subject to specific licensing by the Central Bank: business expenses of Turkish firms abroad, trans- fers related to copyrights for scientific and artistic works (up to US$10,000 may be provided in advance by the Central Bank), proceeds of foreign air transportation companies, payments related to insurance, revenue of 512 foreign consulates, and government expenses. The trans- fer of income related to foreign investment and the payment of interest on foreign credits are permitted freely within the terms of Foreign Capital Law No. 6224 and similar laws and regulations. All resident Turkish nationals may travel abroad with a maximum of US$3,000 each without proof of ex- change allocation by commercial banks. Banks are allowed to allocate up to US$1,000 a person a trip for tourist travel, or US$500 a person a trip for travelers under 18 years of age. Foreign nationals domiciled in Turkey may purchase from banks foreign exchange for up to US$200 a trip. For business travel, the allowance is up to US$2,000 a person a trip. Special limits, as well as administrative norms, are in force for the purchase of foreign exchange for travel and other expenses related to medical treatment, study and other training, and assis- tance to conferences. Outbound travelers are subject to a tax equivalent to US$100, payable in Turkish liras, regardless of whether there are related purchases of foreign exchange; the tax is reduced by one half in the case of travelers 18 years of age or younger. Exempted from payment of this tax are (a) all foreign nationals; (b) participants in pilgrimages to Mecca; (c) Turkish workers employed abroad and their families; (d) crews of ships and planes, and truck drivers; (e) those living in border areas and who may leave the country by Administrative Permits; (f) those going abroad for medical treatment and their escorts; (g) private students going abroad for education purposes; and (h) civil servants (and their families) sent abroad on permanent assignment. Travelers are permitted to take out up to the Turkish lira equivalent of US$1,000 in Turkish bank notes and coins. Nonresidents may take out without restriction the unspent portion of the foreign exchange that they brought in. Provided that the foreign exchange was declared at the time of entry, nonresident travelers can reconvert liras into foreign currency upon presentation of a document showing that foreign exchange had pre- viously been sold to an authorized dealer in Turkey; documentary evidence is not required for foreign ex- change not exceeding US$100. Turkish workers em- ployed abroad and persons domiciled abroad may freely take abroad with them foreign exchange in excess of US$3,000 or its equivalent, provided that such amounts were declared on arrival. Exports and Export Proceeds Commercial exports fall into the following categories: (1) exports subject to permission, including re-exports, transit trade, etc; (2) exports subject to license, which apply to 11 items (rice, fodder, crude vegetable oils, oil seeds, hides and fu rs, certain livestock, and a few other items); (3) exports subject to registration, including exports on consignment or on joint account, exports on credit, and exports related to bilateral agreements; and (4) exports from free zones in or outside Turkey or from duty-free warehouses that are not subject to permission, ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution license, or registration. Exports of goods not falling w i th in the above-mentioned categories are unrestricted. Barter trade is prohibited, except in permitted cases. Authorized pub l ic sector agencies and export companies w i th export earnings of at least US$50 million a calendar year may enter into barter trade. The surrender requirement for foreign exchange earn- ings in the case of merchandise exports is 80 percent. Foreign exchange not surrendered may be deposited in foreign exchange accounts w i th commercial banks, left abroad, or otherwise disposed of. The maximum period allowed for the surrender of at least 80 percent of export proceeds is three months from the date of export. Under an export tax rebate scheme, direct and indirect taxes paid are refunded in the case of industrial exports. The max imum level of rebate as of the end of 1985 was 10 percent of export value; certain exports are eligible for special additional rebates of up to 6 percent. Proceeds from Invisibles The repatriation of foreign exchange accruing to residents for services rendered by them to nonresidents is mandatory. These foreign exchange earnings may be (1) totally or partially sold to banks; (2) deposited in foreign exchange accounts w i th commercial banks; or (3) transferred to other parties in Turkey or abroad. Individuals residing in Turkey may accept foreign currency from nonresidents for transactions processed in Turkey. There are no limits on the importation of Turkish bank notes and coins. The importation of foreign currency is unrestricted. Capital Nonresident ind iv idua ls and corporations w ish ing to invest in Turkey must import the required capital in the form of foreign exchange or in kind and must obtain a license from the Foreign Capital Department of the State Planning Organization. Exempt from the requirement to bring in capital in the form of foreign exchange are certain investments made in accordance with the provi- sions of the Law for the Encouragement of Foreign Investments, or the Petroleum Law, or investments authorized to be made through the use of blocked funds by the Foreign Capital Department. Proceeds of sales and liquidation of foreign capital may be transferred out of the country on the approval of the Foreign Capital Department, which should inform the Central Bank of the amount to be transferred. Resident ind iv idua ls or corporations may invest abroad up to the equivalent of US$3 million in cash or in kind with authorization from the Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade; higher amounts must be approved by the Council of Ministers unless the investment is financed by foreign currency obtained outside Turkey. Individuals or cor- porations authorized to invest and conduct commercial activities abroad must provide information of their activities to the Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign TURKEY Trade, inc lud ing the submission of an annual report of activities at the end of the calendar year. Reasonable income from real estate and proceeds from real estate sales not exceeding the purchase value of related real estate in foreign exchange inf low can be transferred abroad through the banks upon presentation of documents showing previous inflow equal to at least the initial property value. Income from real estate acquired without conversion of foreign exchange can be used in Turkey in the form of local currency but cannot be transferred abroad; such funds can be kept in blocked accounts at the Central Bank. Blocked funds are those accrued or accruing to nonresidents but not transferable under existing exchange control regulations. These funds may be used in Turkey for authorized investments, for living expenses of owners and relatives (up to certain ceilings), contributions to public organizations, etc. Commercial banks authorized to operate in foreign exchange on their own account may open "exchange accounts" or "convertible Turkish lira accounts" for individuals residing in Turkey or abroad. Funds in such accounts may be freely disposed of by the holders, and interest rates and other conditions on the above accounts are freely negotiable between the parties. Commercial banks are free to conduct foreign exchange transactions according to their needs. The minimum amount of foreign exchange that the commercial banks can hold in their correspondent accounts is 20 percent of their short- term liabilities, which are defined to consist of (a) acceptance credits and pre-export f inanc ing guaran- teed by the banks and having a maturity of up to six months; (b) letters of credit; and (c) mail credits. Banks are also obliged to hold a m in imum of 20 percent of the foreign exchange credits received in the foreign ex- change deposit accounts. The limits for the said amount are as follows: banks w i th (a) liabilities up to US$10 million, a sum equal to their liabilities at most; (b) liabilities between US$10 million and US$20 mil- lion, 100 percent for the first US$10 million and 40 percent for the remainder; and (c) with liabilities more than US$20 million, at most 40 percent of the total liabilities. Furthermore, banks can hold foreign ex- change in their correspondent accounts up to 100 percent of the foreign exchange credits received in the foreign exchange deposit accounts. Commercial banks approved by the Prime Ministry may obtain the following types of foreign loans: (a) term credit provided directly, within a maximum maturity of one year; and (b) intermediated prefinancing commodity and acceptance credits. The banks may also guarantee foreign borrowing operations by the nonbank private sector authorized by the State Planning Organization under the terms for approved investment projects. Foreign trade joint stock companies may obtain directly foreign loans related to their field of activity and carrying maturities of up to two years with the authorization of the Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade. Under certain conditions, banks and nonbank residents may engage in foreign lending operations, in some cases with 513 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TURKEY the prior approval of the Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade. A Foreign Exchange Risk Insurance Scheme (FERIS) is designed to provide domestic borrowers with an exchange rate guarantee for approved foreign borrowing. Foreign borrowing under the scheme is on-lent in Turkish lira at a domestic interest rate determined on an annual basis. The difference between the interest rate on the foreign borrowing and any bank commission and the domestic interest rate charged is credited to the scheme. The difference between the lira cost at the time it is contracted and the lira cost of repayments is covered from resources of the scheme. Gold The Central Bank of Turkey is authorized to import gold to Turkey and carry out the purchases and sales of it to the public freely. Import and export of processed precious metal stones and goods for commercial pur- poses are subject to regulations within the export and import regime. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement July 1. Authorization was given for commercial banks to determine their buying and selling rates for foreign exchange transactions. Imports and Import Payments January 1. The production tax on imports was eliminated. April 1. The rates of guarantee deposits were reduced by 25 percent.

In addition, the list of import items subject to prior permission was reduced from 1,000 to 600, while the list of imports subject to special levies was expanded. December 26. The Negative List was abolished, with the exception of import items prohibited by specific laws (such as narcotics, weapons, ammunitions and weapon components), and the number of import items subject to license was reduced from 625 to 245. In addition, the general guarantee deposit rate was reduced to 3 percent, and the special rate for the deposit was set at 1 percent. Exports and Export Proceeds January 1. The system of preferential credits for specified export items was abolished. In addition, the general rate of export tax rebate was reduced from 20 percent to 10 percent, and the special rate, from 10 percent to 6 percent. 514 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution UGANDA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Uganda is the Uganda Shilling. The official exchange rate of the Uganda shilling against the U.S. dollar is determined at weekly auctions held by the Bank of Uganda, taking into account private demand for foreign exchange in relation to available supply for current international transactions. The Bank of Uganda rarely deals in foreign currencies1 other than deutsche mark, pounds sterling, U.S. dollars, and Japanese yen. On December 31, 1985 the official buying and selling rates were U Sh 1,394.40 and U Sh 1,408.40, respec- tively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates for other currencies are determined on the basis of the cross rates for the U.S. dollar in the international market. Govern- ment ministries and departments are forbidden to bid at the foreign exchange auction; their quarterly access to sales of foreign exchange is subject to a limit of 22 percent of all sales of foreign exchange. In its foreign exchange dealings, the Bank of Uganda charges a commission of 0.4 percent buying and 0.6 percent selling. Authorized commercial banks in Uganda deal in all specified currencies2 at rates quoted by the Bank of Uganda or, for a currency not quoted, at rates calculated according to prevailing cross rates. Authorized banks may, subject to exchange control approval, deal forward with customers in sterling, U .S. dollars, and other currencies, provided that there is an underlying approved import or export contract. Authorized foreign exchange dealers impose a service charge of not more than 0.5 percent. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control The Bank of Uganda administers exchange control on behalf of the Minister of Finance. Import and export control is administered by the Ministry of Commerce. The Minister of Commerce has powers to prohibit imports and exports. Prescription of Currency The Bank of Uganda holds reciprocal accounts with the central banks of Kenya and Tanzania, which are settled in U .S. dollars. Authorized payments, including payments for imports, by residents of Uganda to resi- dents of foreign countries other than Israel and South Africa may be made in Uganda shillings to the credit of an External Account in Uganda, or in any other currency that is appropriate to the country of residence of the payee. Receipts from such countries may be obtained in 1 Foreign currencies are all currencies other than the Uganda shilling. 2Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish and Faeroese kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, U.S. dollars, and all currencies of the former Sterling Area other than the Uganda shilling. Uganda shillings from an External Account in Uganda or in any convertible currency. Payments to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Certain settlements with Burundi, Rwanda, and Zaire are channeled through special accounts. External Accounts Accounts in Uganda shillings held by residents of foreign countries are designated External Accounts. They may be credited freely with authorized payments by residents of Uganda, with transfers from other External Accounts, and with the proceeds from sales of any foreign exchange currency and gold by nonresidents of Uganda to authorized dealers. They may be debited freely for payments to nonresidents, for transfers to other External Accounts in Uganda, and for purchases of foreign currencies from authorized dealers. Nontransferable funds of persons not resident in Uganda are credited to Blocked Accounts maintained with commercial banks. Subject to prior approval, balances on Blocked Accounts may be used for the purchase in Uganda of specified bonds and shares issued in Uganda; the redemption proceeds of government bonds so acquired are transferable beginning five years from the date of purchase. Subject to individual permis- sion, such balances may also be used for payments to residents not related to export transactions. Convertible Currency Accounts Private Ugandan nationals or institutions with funds abroad may be authorized to operate Convertible Cur- rency Accounts with commercial banks in Uganda. Intending operators of such accounts are required to disclose the sources of the funds and to put up a minimum of the equivalent of US$5,000 to open the account. These accounts can be freely debited, and other governing regulations are similar to those for the regime of External Accounts (see above). The minimum balance in each such account must be at least US$3,000, below which the account is liable to closure by the Bank of Uganda. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Israel and South Africa are pro- hibited. Most imports are controlled through import licensing. Import licenses are issued by the Ugandan Advisory Board of Trade (UABT) under the Minister of Commerce; a commission of 0.5 percent of license value is levied by the UABT. These licenses are issued freely for all nonprohibited imports. With the exception of repeater and proprietary imports, anyone wishing to import goods valued in excess of US$20,000 is required to submit to the UABT pro forma invoices from three different suppliers. Imports normally must be pur- chased directly from the country of origin. Documentary 515 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution UGANDA evidence showing that the goods have been imported into Uganda must be forwarded to the exchange control authorities within four months from the date of payment in the case of goods shipped by surface transportation, and within two months for goods brought into the country by air. A monthly foreign exchange budget is prepared by a Committee headed by the chairman of the Presidential Economic Advisory Committee, and is approved by the Minister of Finance. Subject to prior approval by the Bank, imports of specified types of capital goods are permitted on a consignment basis. All bids for foreign exchange at the auction must be accompanied by bank checks in Uganda shillings equiva- lent to the total bids at their respective rates. Bidders are reimbursed for the excess of their bids over their actual domestic currency payments as computed on the basis of the auction clearing rate. Successful bidders are required to buy Tax Deposit Receipts bearing market rates of interest, equivalent to the full value of the applicable customs and sales taxes before receiving the corre- sponding foreign exchange. Foreign exchange alloca- tions to various ministries and departments must be backed by documents showing approval of the Central Tender Board, an original budget authorization, and the signature of the Secretary of the Treasury or a duly designated officer. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to all countries are subject to approval by the Bank of Uganda; payments to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. For business travel a daily allowance of US$150 a person is granted, up to an annual limit of US$2,000 a person. The maximum yearly travel allowance for purposes other than business is US$500 a person. Expatriates working in Uganda may obtain allocations for travel outside Uganda at the time of their overseas leave subject to the terms of the original contract. Foreign exchange is not normally released for nursery, primary, and secondary education abroad. Allowances for post-secondary education abroad are based on estimates of tuition fees, board and lodging, and incidental expenses; foreign exchange is not nor- mally provided when a comparable level of instruction is provided in Uganda. Facilities exist whereby salaried foreign nationals may remit to their country of origin up to one third of their gross monthly earnings to cover family maintenance, savings, etc., provided that they are on a contract of employment that includes a firm commitment to leave Uganda upon expiry of the con- tract. At this time, they may also remit a further US$5,000. Allowances for medical and advertising expenses are considered on a case-by-case basis. Appli- cations to remit profits, dividends, and interest payments are automatically approved; however, some arrears incurred on profits and dividends prior to the opening of the dual market remain outstanding. Payments by the private nonbank sector for all other invisible transactions and for certain capital transfers are 516 subject to a combined limit specified below in the section on Capital. There are arrears in respect of the servicing of public external debt. The export of Uganda bank notes and coin by travelers is prohibited, except that travelers may take out U Sh 3,000 in Uganda currency. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Israel and South Africa are prohib- ited. Exports require licenses from the UABT and may be restricted to ensure sufficient supplies for consump- tion in Uganda. The Uganda Tea Authority has a monopoly over the export of tea; the Coffee Marketing Board, over the export of coffee; and the Lint Market- ing Board, over the export of raw cotton. Export proceeds in specified currencies (see foot- note 2) must be collected within four months for goods shipped overseas and within two months for goods ex- ported to neighboring countries or by air to any destina- tion and sold to an authorized bank for Uganda shillings. The authorized bank must in turn surrender these proceeds to the Bank of Uganda within three business days, failure of which entails payment of interest at a rate of 5 percent above the LIBOR. Coffee and cotton are subject to export du ty. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in specified currencies (see footnote 2) must be sold to an authorized bank within 48 hours. The import of Uganda bank notes and coin by travelers is prohibited, except that returning residents may bring in U Sh 3,000 a person. Travelers may freely bring in bank notes denominated in specified currencies and foreign currency traveler's checks. Capital Capital transfers to all countries require individual exchange control approval, and those to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Foreign assets must be deposited with an authorized depository, except that residents of Uganda may be granted exemption in respect of specified former Sterling Area assets held prior to June 11, 1965. Residents of Uganda leaving permanently may normally transfer their assets up to the equivalent of US$10,000 a family unit from their declared assets. Amounts in excess of this are placed in a Blocked Account and invested in Government of Uganda securities.

Principal payments on nonguaranteed overseas borrow- ing by resident companies or individuals are transfer- able. There are no restrictions on nonguaranteed over- seas borrowing by resident companies or individuals. Foreign investment is permitted in Uganda with or without government participation.

To secure a guarantee of repatriation, it is necessary to obtain "approved status" for the investment in terms of the Foreign Investments (Protection) Act, 1964; in normal circumstances, ap- proved status is given freely. Foreign and domestic investment in specified types of production requires approval under the Licensing Act of 1969. All imports and exports of securities require approval. Approval is freely granted for the purchase by nonresi- dents of Ugandan securities, provided that payment is received in an appropriate manner. The income from such securities is remittable, and the proceeds on resale are normally remittable also. A resident of Uganda may not send money abroad, for whatever purpose, without specific exchange control approval. Prior exchange control approval is required for loans or overdraft facilities granted to a nonresident or to a corporate body resident in Uganda that is controlled, directly or indi- rectly, by persons resident outside Uganda. Payments by the private nonbank sector for all other capital transfers and all invisible payments not specified above are freely permitted up to an aggregate maximum allowance of US$500 a person a year, provided there is adequate evidence to support the application. UGANDA Gold A commemorative gold coin with a face value of U Sh 500 is legal tender but in practice does not circulate. Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Uganda for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and autho- rized industrial and professional users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in Uganda in any form other than jewelry. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler require licenses issued by the Ministry of Finance. Export licenses are not normally granted except for exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. The import of the following from all sources is subject to individual licensing: jewelry of gold, silver, or platinum; goldsmiths' or silversmiths' wares, including set gems; bullion in the form of ingot, bar, or sheet; and gold coin. Import licenses for gold bullion, gold jewelry, and gold coin are issued restric- tively and only to goldsmiths. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement The Uganda shilling was depreciated on numer- ous occasions during 1985, from a mid-point rate of U Sh 520.52 = US$1 at the end of 1984 to one of U Sh 1,401.40 = US$1 at the end of 1985, representing a cumulative depreciation of 62.9 percent. 517 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution UNITED ARAB EMIRATES1 (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the United Arab Emirates is the U .A .E. Dirham, which is pegged to the SDR at Dh 4.76190 = SDR 1. The United Arab Emirates has established margins of 7.25 percent around the official rate; since November 1980, the U .A .E. dirham has maintained an unchanged relationship with the U .S. dol- lar, involving wider margins. The U .S. dollar is the intervention currency, and the Central Bank publishes buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar only. On December 31, 1985 the official buying and selling rates were Dh 3.6690 and Dh 3.6730, respectively, per US$1. The Central Bank sets no limits on the amount of U .S. dollars that it is prepared to buy from or sell to any commercial bank. Commercial banks are free to enter into foreign exchange transactions at rates of their own choosing; the rates quoted by commercial banks for currencies other than the U.S. dollar are determined on the basis of international quotations. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. There is a swap facility at the Central Bank, which the commercial banks may use to purchase dirhams spot and sell dirhams forward for periods of one week, one month, and three months. For each bank, maximum limits of US$20 million outstanding for one-month and three-month swaps and US$10 million outstanding for one-week swaps are in effect. There is also a limit of US$3 million in purchases a day for each bank for one- month and three-month swaps. Swap facilities are not available to banks having a short position in dirhams except for the covering of forward transactions for commercial purposes. The United Arab Emirates formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2 , 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, on February 13, 1974. Administration of Control There is neither exchange control legislation nor an exchange control authority in the United Arab Emirates, and there are no registration requirements for inward or outward transfers. There is no regime of export and import licensing. Prescription of Currency All settlements with Israel and South Africa are prohibited. No other prescription of currency require- ments are in force. Nonresident Accounts No distinction is made between accounts held by residents and those held by nonresidents. 'The seven federated states of the United Arab Emirates are Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, A jman, Umm al Qaiwain, Ras al Kha imah, and Fujairah. 518 Imports and Import Payments Imports from South Africa and Israel are prohibited, as are imports of products manufactured by foreign companies blacklisted by the Arab League. Imports of a few commodities are prohibited from all sources for health or security reasons. Virtually all other com- modities may be freely imported w i thout an individual import permit, but only licensed parties can enter the import trade and an importer can import only the com- modities specified in his license. There are no restric- tions on the availability of foreign exchange for pay- ments in respect of permitted imports. With the excep- tion of specified items, imports into the United Arab Emirates are subject to a customs duty of 4 percent of the c . i . f. value. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports and re-exports to South Africa and Israel are prohibited. Virtually all commodities may be exported or re-exported freely and without an export license, to any destination, other than South Africa and Israel. Each Emirate establishes its own export regulations. The proceeds from exports need not be repatriated or surrendered and may be disposed of freely, regardless of the currency involved. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles All payments for current invisibles may be made freely, with the exception of payments to South Africa and Israel, which are prohibited. There are no require- ments governing receipts. Travelers may take out and bring in any amount in foreign or domestic bank notes. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or payments by residents or nonresidents. Not less than 70 percent of corporate shares of financial institutions (excluding banks) must be held by nationals or organizations of the United Arab Emirates; the chairman and two thirds of the board of directors must also be nationals of the United Arab Emirates. Commer- cial banks operating in the United Arab Emirates are prohibited from owning real estate except for the purpose of carrying on business and for accommodation. Under the United Arab Emirates Company Law (Law No. 8, 1984), at least 51 percent of the equity of companies, other than branches of foreign companies, must be held by nationals of the United Arab Emirates. Profits on foreign capital invested in the United Arab Emirates may be remitted free ly.

The distribution of profits by local banks and the outward transfer of profits by foreign banks were made subject to prior approval by the Central Bank. January 17. The Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates issued a regulation reminding all commercial banks operating in the country to abide by Federal Law No. 10 of 1980 prohibiting the banks from acquiring real estate except for the purpose of carrying on business and for accommodation. Ownership of real estate resulting UNITED ARAB EMIRATES from settlement of debt w i th the banks' clients could be retained for up to three years, beyond which approval of the Central Bank Governor would be needed. January 21. The Central Bank announced that a new issue of floating rate certificates of deposit (CDs) would be offered to commercial banks in the United Arab Emirates only; these would not be transferable to nonresidents. The new CDs were denominated in units of Dh 1 million, issued w i th maturities of one, two, three, and six months, and were purchasable w i th foreign currency at a fixed rate of Dh 3.6725 = US$1, w i th interest payable at ma tur i ty. The coupon is set by a formula that gives them a yield between Euro-dollar rates and the local interbank market. June 15. The Ministry of Economy and Commerce issued regulations for the implementation of the new United Arab Emirates Company Law of 1984, which specified that at least 51 percent of the equity of companies (except branches of foreign companies) should be held by nationals of the United Arab Emirates and required all companies operating in the United Arab Emirates to conform to one of the fo l low ing categories: un l im i ted, limited and share partnership (restricted to United Arab Emirates nationals), limited liability share- holding companies, closed and public stock companies, and private un l im i ted companies (joint ventures). 519 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution UNITED KINGDOM (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the United Kingdom is the Pound Sterling. The authorities of the United Kingdom do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions, and the exchange rate is determined largely by the balance of market forces. Whether the rate is rising or falling, intervention by the authorities is limited to smoothing operations to moderate excessive fluctuations and preserve orderly markets. On December 31, 1985 the closing selling and buying rates for the U .S. dollar in the London foreign exchange market as observed by the Bank of England were US$1.4450 and US$1.4460, respectively, per £ 1. Banks are allowed to engage in spot and forward exchange transactions in any currency, and they may deal among themselves and with residents and nonresidents in foreign notes and coin at free market rates of exchange. The United Kingdom formally accepted the obliga- tions of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from February 15, 1961. Administration of Control Exchange controls have been abolished. The licensing of imports and exports is handled mostly by the Department of Trade and Industry, but other departments also issue licenses in specialized fields. Prescription of Currency There are no prescription of currency requirements. Imports and Import Payments Payments for imports may be made freely.

For any type of travel, U .K. residents can obtain on demand from banks and travel agents such foreign exchange as they may require without limitation. The cost of accom- modation, fares, etc., can be paid for without limit in the United Kingdom. Personal checks may be cashed abroad and credit cards may be used without restriction. Travelers may take out any amount in sterling or foreign currency notes. Residents may retain unused travel exchange expressed in foreign currency after return to the United Kingdom. Exports and Export Proceeds Most exports are free of export control and there are no requirements affecting export proceeds.12 Under the Tender to Contract Facility of the Export Credit Guaran- tee Department, exporters bidding for major capital projects in Canadian dollars, deutsche mark, Japanese yen, Swiss francs, or U .S. dollars when the contract is for the equivalent of at least £ 10 million may obtain cover against exchange rate fluctuations between the submission of their bid and the award of the contract. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts in foreign currencies on account of invisibles may be retained or may be sold for sterling. British and other bank notes may be brought into the United Kingdom freely. Capital There are no restrictions on capital transfers by residents of the United Kingdom into the beneficial ownership of residents of other countries. All proceeds from the realization, redemption, or maturity of sterling capital assets (including direct investments) are remitta- ble at the market rate of exchange. Residents of the United Kingdom who leave w i th the intention of residing abroad may transfer all their assets on departure from the United Kingdom. Repatriates who, having been resident in the United Kingdom, return to take up residence in any other country may transfer all their sterling assets abroad at the market rate of exchange.

The Government also has powers under the Industry Act of 1975 to prevent or undo undesirable foreign takeovers of important manufactur- ing undertakings, but these powers have never been used. There are no restrictions on transactions in sterling or foreign currency securities, which may be exported or imported without formality. Warrants issued by regis- trars, company secretaries, and paying agents in respect of interest, dividends, and capital payments on securities registered in the names of nonresidents may be dis- patched abroad freely. Banks may freely accept foreign currency deposits and employ them in their foreign currency business or convert them to sterling, subject to prudential guidelines issued by the Bank of England concerning the limitation of risks arising from their foreign exchange exposure. Net spot liabilities in foreign currencies ( i .e ., the net amount of foreign currency resources fund ing sterling assets) form part of a bank's eligible liabilities that are subject to a '/> of 1 percent noninterest-bearing deposit requirement with the Bank of England and may also be subject to calls for special deposits to be placed w i th the Bank. There is currently no special deposit call. Gold Gold bullion and gold coin are not subject to control in the United Kingdom. Gold sovereigns are legal tender but do not circulate. Gold coins have also been issued in Jersey and the Isle of Man and are legal tender there. Except under license granted by the Treasury, it is an offense to melt down or break up any metal coin that is for the time being current in the United Kingdom or that, hav ing been current there, has at any time after May 16, 1969 ceased to be so. The export of gold in manufac- tured form over 50 years old and valued at £ 8,000 and over for each item or matching set of items also requires a license from the Department of Trade and Industry. There is a free gold market in London in which gold bars are freely traded. The U .K. authorities do not intervene in the market as either buyers or sellers.

The U.S. authorities do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions, and spot and forward exchange rates are determined on the basis of demand and supply conditions in the exchange markets. However, the authorities intervene when necessary to counter disor- derly conditions in the exchange markets or when otherwise deemed appropriate. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. The United States formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agree- ment as from December 10, 1946. Administration of Control1 The Department of the Treasury administers licensing programs involving direct or indirect financial or com- mercial transactions with Cuba, Democratic Kampu- chea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Viet Nam, or their nationals, as specified under the Foreign Assets Control Regulations and the Cuban Assets Control Regulations. It also administers restric- tions on certain trade and transportation-related activities involving Nicaragua under the Nicaraguan Trade Control Regulations; and has administrative responsibility for blocked accounts of the above countries as well as accounts of Estonia, the German Democratic Republic, Latvia, and Lithuania, blocked since World War II under the Foreign Funds Control Regulations.2 The Customs Service of the Treasury Department administers import quotas; such quotas, however, are frequently established or allocated by other agencies. The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agree- ments, chaired by the Department of Commerce, with representatives from other agencies, decides when to request consultation with countries to limit imports on the basis of the guidelines of the Multifiber Arrangement and bilateral restraint agreements. Import quotas on specified dairy products are administered by the Depart- ment of Agriculture through the issuance of import *On January 7, 1986 the United States imposed an embargo on trade in most goods, services, and technology with the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, along with prohibitions on travel and transportation-related transactions, engagement in contracts, and ex- tensions of credits and loans.

Global quotas on sugar are set on a quarterly basis by the Secretary of Agriculture. For items subject to export control—other than crude petroleum and petroleum products and munitions —the Department of Commerce is, in general, the responsible authority. There are no restrictions on foreign payments, except those imposed under Treasury Department regulations for security reasons on transactions involving the author- ities or nationals of Cuba, Democratic Kampuchea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Viet Nam, those on trade and transportation-related transactions involving Nicaragua, and, to a very limited extent (see footnote 2), those affecting certain assets of the Govern- ment of the Islamic Republic of Iran, its agencies, instrumentalities, and controlled entities. However, cer- tain payments to Cuba, Democratic Kampuchea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Viet Nam related to authorized travel are permitted, as are certain payments in connection with travel to and in the United States by nationals of these countries. Limited remit- tances to the remitter's close relatives in Cuba and Viet Nam are also permitted. Imports and Import Payments Imports originating in Cuba, Democratic Kampuchea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Viet Nam, and Nicaragua are prohibited under Treasury regula- tions, unless specifically authorized. Beginning from October 11, 1985, the importation of South African krugerrands was prohibited under the South Africa Control Regulations. Import quotas are in effect for (1) cotton, certain cotton waste and products, most dairy products, and peanuts; (2) certain fish and certain potatoes (tariff-rate quotas); (3) sugar and certain sugar products; and (4) certain specialty steel products. Moreover, quotas may be imposed by the President under specified conditions on certain types of meat. Among the quantita- tive import quotas, all except those for peanuts, certain cotton products, butter, oil, sugar and certain sugar products, and certain specialty steel products are on a country-of-production basis. Certain dairy products that are subject to quotas are also subject to import licensing. Imports of heavyweight motorcycles are subject to tariff quotas. The United States is a party to the GATT Multifiber Arrangement (MFA) and to 29 bilateral textile agree- ments negotiated in accordance with the Arrangement's provisions. These agreements control trading partners' exports of textiles and apparel to the United States and provide for orderly expansion of trade without disrupting U .S. markets for these products. Imports from both agreement and nonagreement countries are monitored along with domestic industry performance to determine if market disruption exists or is threatened. When 523 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution UNITED STATES necessary, consultations are requested to establish export limitations. Imports of textiles and textile products are subject to rules of origin issued by the U .S. Customs Service in the Department of the Treasury. Imports of crude petroleum and petroleum products originating in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya are prohibited (see foot- note 1). Imports of a number of manufactured products are also effectively restricted by bilateral agreements or by the multilateral procedures of GATT Article XIX designed to provide temporary relief to certain distressed industries, including those of motorcycles, clothespins, and steel. A Free Trade Area Agreement is in force with Israel. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) scheme for developing countries has been in operation in the United States since January 1976 and is scheduled to continue through July 4, 1993. Under a procedure referred to as "product graduation," eligibility can be withdrawn on a product-by-product basis from countries considered to be no longer in need of the tariff preference. Cumulative treatment under the GSP scheme is extended to members of the Andean Group, ASEAN, and CARICOM: cumulation allows two or more member countries of an eligible association to contribute jointly to the requirement that at least 35 percent of the direct cost of producing a given product should originate in the beneficiary country. Exempted from competitive need limits is a category of countries designated as "least- developed" beneficiaries; currently, 32 countries are thus designated.3 During the ten years ended in December 1985, duty-free imports by the United States under the scheme have increased from US$3.2 billion to US$13.3 billion. Under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act, 21 countries and entities4 have been designated to receive preferential tariff treatment on specified imports for the period through September 30, 1995. Exports and Export Proceeds Munitions may be exported only under license issued by the Office of Munitions Control in the Department of State.

Certain computer and nuclear exports to specified South African agencies are prohibited. Exports to all other countries, except Canada, of designated strategic materials and equipment require individual validated licenses from the Department of Commerce. For many commodities, when exported to countries other than Afghanistan, member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), Cuba, Democratic Kampuchea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Lao Peo- ple's Democratic Republic, the Socialist People's Lib- yan Arab Jamahiriya, Viet Nam, and Nicaragua, single distribution licenses may be obtained to cover a fu ll year's shipment. The licensing requirements applicable to Yugoslavia are less restrictive than those applicable to other Eastern European countries. Under the Export Administration Act of 1979, which was renewed in 1985, the President can suspend the export of goods for reasons of national security, foreign policy, or short supply in the domestic economy, although efforts are made to minimize the use of such authority. For agricultural commodities, such as wheat, corn, sorghum, soybean, and soybean oil, exporting companies are required to participate in a reporting system that is designed to improve market information and to allow for more orderly exporting and, thereby, lessen substantially the need for government interven- tion. The proceeds of exports are not subject to exchange control. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments and transfers abroad may be made freely, except for payments to or for the account of the authorities or nationals of Cuba, Democratic Kam- puchea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Viet Nam, and certain payments relating to Nicaragua, which are permitted only under license.5 U .S. residents are allowed to remit up to US$500 a quarter to close relatives in Cuba and US$300 a quarter to close relatives in Viet Nam.

Investments involving ownership interest in banks are subject to federal and state banking regulations. However, as noted above, there are restric- tions on certain transactions with, or involving, Cuba, Democratic Kampuchea, the Democratic People's Re- public of Korea, Viet Nam, and, to a lesser extent, Nicaragua (see footnote 5 concerning the Islamic Re- public of Iran). In addition, there are certain reporting requirements for travelers entering or leaving the United States when they are carrying more than US$5,000 in cash or negotiable instruments (as well as corresponding reporting requirements for shipment of currency or bearer assets through the mails). In addition, ownership of U.S. farmland by foreign nationals or by U.S. corpo- rations of which 5 percent or more is foreign-owned must be reported to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Certain states in the United States impose varying restrictions on purchases of land within their borders by foreign nationals. Member banks are discouraged by the Federal Reserve Board from soliciting or encouraging placement of deposits by U.S. residents at their foreign branches, unless such deposits are placed to serve a definite, necessary purpose outside the United States. The foreign currency positions of banks, whether overall or with respect to individual currencies, are not subject to prudential limitations of a quantitative nature, but banks are expected to follow normal banking practices and not maintain imprudent positions. U.S. agencies and branches of foreign banks, as well as domestic banks, are subject to reserve requirements by the Federal Reserve system. Loans and extension of credit by financial institutions to the South African Government or its entities are prohibited, with certain exceptions. Beginning December 3, 1981, U.S. chartered deposi- tory institutions, U.S. offices of Edge and Agreement Corporations,6 and U .S. branches and agencies of foreign banks may establish international banking facili- ties (IBFs) in the United States. IBFs may accept deposits only from foreign residents (including foreign offices of domestic banks), from other IBFs, or from the institution establishing the IBF. Such funds are exempt from reserve requirements of Regulation D and from 6These are defined as domestically chartered corporations authorized to engage in international banking and financial operations. UNITED STATES interest rate limitations of Regulation Q. For nonbank foreign residents, the minimum maturity or notice requirement is two business days, and the minimum transaction amount is US$100,000. Funds raised by an IBF may be used only to extend credit to foreign residents (including foreign offices of domestic banks), to other IBFs, or to the entity establishing the IBF. Credit may be extended to nonbank foreign residents only if the proceeds are used to finance operations of the borrower or its affiliates outside the United States. Advances from an IBF to its establishing entity in the United States are subject to Eurocurrency requirements in the same manner as advances to the establishing entity from the entity's foreign offices. A number of individual states (but not the Federal Government) have granted favorable tax treatment under state or local law to IBF operations. In addition, federal legislation was enacted to exempt deposits at IBFs from Federal Deposit Insur- ance Corporation insurance coverage and assessments. Gold U.S. citizens or residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad, except for certain gold transactions (e.g., imports or exports) involving Cuba, Democratic Kampuchea, the Demo- cratic People's Republic of Korea, Viet Nam, and Nicaragua. Imports of South African krugerrands are prohibited. Commercial banks may deal in gold bullion and gold coin, with the same exceptions. Treasury licensing for importers, exporters, producers, refiners, and processors of gold is not required, with the same country exceptions. Producers of gold may sell their output in the free market, with the same country exceptions. Gold, but not counterfeit gold coins, may be freely imported, except from the countries mentioned above. U .S. gold coins are legal tender at their face value. Commercial imports of gold jewelry are free of quantitative restriction but are subject to import duty at a rate of approximately 12 percent. There is no duty on gold ore, bullion, or coin. All forms of gold must be declared at the point of entry into the United States. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement September 22. In concert with other member countries of the Group of Five (France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom) the United States declared, inter alia, that exchange rates did not fully reflect fundamental economic conditions, that further measures aimed at opening up markets would be important in resisting protectionism, and that the mem- bers of the Group of Five agreed that some further orderly appreciation of the main nondollar currencies against the U .S. dollar would be desirable, and ex- pressed their readiness to cooperate more closely to encourage such a development when to do so would be helpful. 525 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution UNITED STATES Imports and Import Payments January 1. The Commerce Department announced that, beginning from this date, it would release certain embargoed textile and apparel goods on a gradual basis, instead of all at once as has traditionally been the practice. (The embargoes had arisen in late 1984 from shipments above agreed limits, or from unresolved consultation calls with certain countries.) The affected textile and apparel goods from Egypt, Singapore, India, and the People's Republic of China would be allowed out of the warehouses at rates not exceeding 20 percent per month of the annual quotas. January 3. Extension of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) became effective for eight-and-a-half years to July 4, 1993, as provided in the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984. January 10. The United States and the European Communities (EC) reached agreement whereby the latter would restrain exports of steel pipes and tubes to 7.6 percent of U .S. consumption in 1985 and in 1986. (See also entries for March 1, June 7, and November 1, 1985, below.) January 28. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) extended the duration of the sugar import quota year (October 1, 1984 to September 30, 1985) by two months to November 30, 1985. At the same time, emergency import quotas were imposed by Presidential Proclamation 5294 on certain sugar-containing articles; annual imports of sweetened cocoa were limited to 3,000 tons, pancake flours and mixes to 7,000 tons, and edible preparations with less than 5 percent butterfat to 84,000 tons. These measures were taken on the grounds that imports of the specified products were interfering with the functioning of the domestic sugar price support program. The quotas would remain in effect pending investigations by the U.S. International Trade Commis- sion (USITC) on the need for import restraints. (See also entry for May 17, 1985.) February 8. Gabon and Papua New Guinea were added to the list of countries authorized to sell their sugar to U .S. buyers; they were included in the category "Other Specified Countries,'* which as a group was allowed to ship 12,500 short tons of sugar on a yearly basis under the U.S. sugar import quota program. February 12. The special import fees on sugar were raised. (The fees increased further in March, and in late March the President rescinded the import fee on raw sugar, but the fee of one cent a pound on imports of refined sugar was retained.) February 27. The Commerce Department made a final determination that imports of calcium hypochlorite from Japan were being sold in the United States at less than fair value (49 Fed. Reg. 7941, February 27, 1985). It determined dumping margins ranging from 0.43 percent to 48.05 percent, with the overall weighted average margin of 12.29 percent. (Subsequently, the USITC, on April 8, determined that the specified imports were injuring the domestic industry, following which, anti- dumping duties were imposed on the affected items.) 526 March 1. Changes were made in import-related regulations as follows: (a) import duty reductions on certain high-technology products were implemented by Presidential Proclamation 5305; (b) the United States agreed to release 209,000 metric tons of steel pipe and tube imports from the EC, which had been shipped to the United States during the U.S. embargo in late 1984 and had been ordered locked in bonded warehouses; and (c) the President announced that the United States would not seek a further extension of the voluntary export restraints on Japanese exports of passenger cars to the United States, which had been in effect during the four- year period April 1, 1981-March 31, 1985. (Subse- quently, Japan announced that it would limit exports of passenger cars to the United States to 2.85 million units during the year ending March 31, 1986, compared with 1.85 million units in the year ending March 31, 1985.) March 5. The U.S. Customs Service published final regulations on rules of origin for textile and apparel imports into the United States (50 Fed. Reg. 8710, March 5, 1985). The main change from the interim regulations of August 3, 1984 (49 Fed. Reg. 31248, August 3, 1984) was that substantial assembly by sewing or tailoring into a complete garment of all pieces of apparel articles that had been cut from fabric in another foreign territory, country, or insular possession would normally convey origin; such imports would also be counted against the quota of the foreign country where the textiles last underwent a substantial transformation. March 5-7. The Commerce Department announced final determinations on countervailing duty (CVD) in- vestigations on imports of textiles and apparel from a number of countries. (The investigations were in re- sponse to antisubsidy petitions filed in 1984 by U.S. textile and apparel manufacturers.) The Department determined the rates of CVDs on textile imports as follows: Argentina, 4.53 percent; Sri Lanka, 5 percent; Peru, 2.88 percent; and Mexico, 3.7 percent. In addi- tion, CVDs on apparel imports were determined as follows: Argentina, 9.87 percent; Sri Lanka, 3.06 per- cent; and Thailand, 1.23 percent. Countervailing duties were not imposed on imports of textiles and apparel from Singapore and Malaysia, as de minimis subsidies were determined in these cases. It was also announced that CVDs would not be imposed on imports of textile mill products from Thailand, nor on textile and apparel imports from Colombia, in view of commitments from these countries to phase out subsidies on the relevant products. March 11. The U.S. Customs Service eliminated, with effect from May 10, 1985, the requirement for Special Customs Invoice (50 Fed. Reg. 9610, March 11, 1985). March 12. The USDA announced that revised inspec- tion standards on imports of pork would come into effect on April 15, 1985 (50 Fed. Reg. 9788, March 12, 1985). March 15. The President designated the Bahamas as a beneficiary under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recov- ery Act. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution April 8. The USITC determined, under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974, that imports into the United States of potassium permanganate were not a substantial cause of serious injury to the domestic industry. In addition, the Commission terminated investigations on imports of textiles and apparel from Turkey, Indonesia, and the Philippines, following withdrawal of counter- vailing duty petitions by the U .S. manufacturers after these countries signed the GATT Subsidies Code. April 17. The U .S. Trade Representative (USTR) withdrew from New Zealand eligibility for the injury test on countervailing duty investigations in respect of subsidized imports, on grounds that the country had not fulfilled its commitment to phase out its main subsidies. April 22. The Governments of the United States and of Israel signed the U.S.-Israel Free Trade Area Agree- ment, which was negotiated under the terms of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984, and was the first such agreement entered into by the United States. Under the terms of the Agreement, which came into effect on August 19, 1985, tariffs on all trade between the United States and Israel, except for a limited number of sensitive products, would be progressively reduced and would be eliminated by January 1995; in most cases, the elimination would take place by January 1989. The Agreement also contained a number of measures designed to reduce nontariff trade barriers, including reductions in licensing restrictions and subsidies on industrial products, and greater access to government procurement procedures. April 23. The United States and Mexico signed an agreement on subsidies and CVDs, under which Mexico agreed to conform its general subsidy policy to those under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and to phase out export subsidies; in turn, the United States agreed that Mexico would be entitled to an "injury test" in U .S. countervailing duty investigations. April 26. The tariff-quota on imports of tuna fish in 1985 was set at 97,495,800 pounds, or 7.5 million pounds more than the quota for 1984 (50 Fed. Reg. 16577, April 26, 1985). April 29. Import duties on certain aircraft equipment and parts were eliminated (50 Fed. Reg. 16578, April 26, 1985). This action was in accordance,with the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft reached in 1983 among certain members of the GATT. May 1. Changes in the GSP program for 1985 were announced following completion of the 1984 Annual Product Review. The cumulative total of imports excluded from GSP under the competitive needs provi- sions amounted to US$13.7 b i l l ion, compared w i th US$10.7 billion in the previous year. Imports of 285 products valued at US$251 million were ruled eligible for GSP under the de minimis waiver, compared w i th US$52 million ruled eligible under this provision in the previous year. The review also added four new items (worth US$41 million in 1984, and comprising prepared cabbage, CB radios, clock cases, and rubber or plastic infant pants) to the list of GSP-eligible products, and deleted one item ( t r i f lu ra l in ). In addition, a group of UNITED STATES products (worth US$163 million) was removed from the list of GSP-eligible items for four countries (Israel, Mexico, Republic of Korea, and Ta iwan t) under the President's discretionary authority. The review also considered a range of products that had previously been excluded from the GSP by the competitive needs limitation but had become eligible for redesignation; imports worth US$246 million in 1984 were redesig- nated to the program. In total, US$2 billion worth of imports (compared w i th US$1.2 billion in the 1983 annual review) were excluded under the President's discretionary authority in 1985. May 7. The United States imposed an embargo on trade with Nicaragua, along with restrictions on dealings with Nicaraguan air carriers and Nicaraguan-registered vessels. Payments related to prohibited transactions, including payments for prohibited imports and exports, were prohibited under the Nicaraguan Trade Control Regulations, which were issued in implementation of the embargo. May 10. The Commerce Department made a final determination that red raspberries from Canada were being sold in the United States at less than fair value (50 Fed. Reg. 19768, May 10, 1985). The dumping margins were found to range from 0.3 percent to 25.8 percent, with the overall weighted-average margin at 2.41 percent. (See also entry for June 10-17, below.) May 13. The USITC determined that imports from Spain of oil country tubular goods allegedly being sold at less than fair value in the United States were injuring the competing domestic industry, but that allegedly dumped imports of these goods from Argentina were not a cause of injury to the domestic industry. The investigations were in response to industry petitions against allegedly dumped and subsidized imports from these countries. May 14. The United States reached agreement with Japan on details of the five-year bilateral agreement negotiated in late 1984 to limit Japanese annual steel exports to the United States to 5.8 percent of U .S. steel consumption. The agreement, retroactive to October 1, 1984, covered six categories of finished steel (sheet and strip, plate, structural, bar, pipe and tube, and wire). In addition, Japan's exports of fabricated steel structures would be limited to 100,000 short tons a year. The bilateral agreement would be reviewed twice during its five-year span (in December 1985 and in September 1987). May 17. Presidential Proclamation 5294 of Jan- uary 28, 1985 was modified to exempt from import quotas certain speciality food items containing sugar (50 Fed. Reg. 20881, May 21, 1985). Eliminated from the category of "edible preparations under 5 percent butterfat" were articles in retail packages, other than dry mixtures; articles in retail packages, if consisting of dry mixtures of 10 percent or less sugar by dry weight; articles in bu lk, whether or not of dry mixtures, containing 10 percent or less sugar by weight; certain tSee Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part Two, page 75. 527 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution UNITED STATES cake decorations containing 65 percent or less sugar by dry weight, crushed coconut meat or juice thereof, with added sugar, containing 65 percent or less sugar by dry weight; and minced seafood preparations containing 20 percent or less sugar by weight. May 20. The Commerce Department announced a final determination that dried heavy salted codfish from Canada was being sold in the United States at less than fair value, with the overall weighted-average dumping margin of 16.22 percent (50 Fed. Reg. 20819, May 20, 1985). In addition, the USITC determined that imports of certain animal feed from France were not injuring a domestic industry. (See also entry for June 10.) May 29. The Commerce Department made a final determination that imports of tubular steel-framed stack- ing chairs from Taiwant were not being sold in the United States at less than fair value, but that such imports from Italy were being sold at less than fair value (50 Fed. Reg. 21917, May 29, 1985). (See also entry for July 3, below.) June 4. The President extended for an additional year most-favored-nation tariff treatment for Romania, Hun- gary, and the People's Republic of China. June 6. The USD A announced that imports of bees, used beekeeping equipment, and honey, beeswax, and pollen used for bee feed would be restricted, effective June 10, 1985, from all sources except Canada, for health reasons; such articles could be imported only if specified inspection and other requirements were fulfilled. June 7. The United States agreed to allow imports of special steel tubing from the EC up to 100,000 tons above the limits in the bilateral agreement of January 1985 (see entry for January 10, above), for use by the Ail-American Pipeline Company in its Texas-to- California project. June 10-17. The USITC, in separate rulings, made affirmative determinations on injury to domestic indus- tries by imports from Canada of certain dried salted codfish and of red raspberries, and a negative determina- tion on imports of specified batteries from the Republic of Korea, which the Commerce Department had deter- mined were being sold in the United States at less than fair value. Following these rulings, antidumping orders were issued against imports of Canadian codfish and red raspberries. The Commerce Department also made a final determination that imports into the United States of swine and pork products from Canada were being subsidized, with a net subsidy estimated at 3.3 Canadian cents a pound. June 21. The President sharply raised duties on imports of pasta products from the EC, on an ad valorem equivalent basis, from 0.25 percent to 25 percent for pasta products made with eggs, and from 0.5 percent to 40 percent for pasta products not made with eggs. This measure was originally to become effective from July 5 but was subsequently made effective on November 1, tSee Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part Two, page 75. 528 1985. The measure was stated to be in retaliation for the EC's reluctance to accept the finding and recom- mendation of the GATT panel investigating U .S. com- plaints about the EC's preferential tariff treatment of citrus fruit from certain Mediterranean countries. (In January 1985 a GATT panel of experts had recom- mended that the EC should consider limiting the adverse effect on U .S. exports of fresh oranges and lemons, as a result of the preferential tariff treatment the EC had accorded to similar products originating in certain Mediterranean countries, but the recommendation was not accepted by the EC. In April 1985 the United States requested compensation from EC members for damage to U .S. citrus growers arising from the EC's preferential tariff regime.) Following the announcement of these measures by the United States, the Commission of the European Communities announced that, in response to the U .S. measure, EC ad valorem tariffs on imports of walnuts and lemons from the United States would be raised from 8 percent to 30 percent and 20 percent, respectively, to become effective when the U .S. measure was implemented. July 1. Import items totaling US$1.8 billion were excluded, under the competitive needs provisions, from coverage of the GSP. July 3. The USITC, in separate rulings, found that allegedly dumped imports of certain tubular steel-framed stacking chairs from Italy were not a cause of injury to domestic producers, but imports of fabric and expanded neoprene laminate from Japan were in jur ing domestic producers; antidumping duties were therefore imposed in the latter case. July 3. In a measure intended to help promote economic growth in the poorest countries, the Presi- dent designated 32 countries as "least-developed" bene- ficiaries of special trade incentives under the GSP (50 Fed. Reg. 27409, July 3, 1985), and the designated countries were placed in a new category exempted from competitive need limits. The countries so designated were Bangladesh, Benin, Bhu tan, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cape Verde, the Central African Repub- lic, Chad, the Comoros, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Lesotho, Malawi, Mal- dives, Mali, Nepal, Niger, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, The Gambia, Togo, Uganda, Western Samoa, and the Yemen Arab Republic. July (various dates). The USITC, in separate rulings, found that imports of certain egg filler flats from Canada and imports of lime oil from Peru were not injuring domestic industries. It also made a final determination that imports from Canada of live swine were injuring the competing domestic industry but those of fresh, chilled, or frozen Canadian pork were not doing so. July 25. The USDA issued a final ruling applying user fees to those imports of cheese and cheese products that were covered by an import licensing system (50 Fed. Reg. 30262, Ju ly 25, 1985). The fees were designed to ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution reimburse the USDA for the cost of administering the licenses. August 5. The following changes occurred in the import system: (a) the Commerce Department made final determinations that imports of low-fum ing brazing cop- per rod and wire from New Zealand were being subsidized but that such imports from South Africa were not being subsidized (50 Fed. Reg. 31638, August 5, 1985). It also made a final affirmative subsidy determi- nation against imports of circular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes from Thailand; and (b) the United States and the EC reached agreement, under which the latter would limit exports of certain steel products to the United States to an annual rate of 475,000 tons in 1985. (The relevant products were previously subject to con- sultation but not to quantitative limits.) The agree- ment would apply to exports of the affected products after August 1, 1985. In light of the agreement, direct U .S. restriction on imports from the EC of the relevant products was averted. (See also entry for November 1, below.) August 7. The Court of International Trade ruled that U .S. countervailing duty laws were applicable to imports from nonmarket-economy countries. This decision re- versed the determination made in 1984 by the Commerce Department. August 21. The Commerce Department ruled that imports of certain carbon steel products from Austria and Sweden were being subsidized and sold at less than fair value in the United States. August 28. The President denied import relief for the domestic footwear industry, turning down a recom- mendation for five-year import quotas made earlier by the USITC, on grounds that such relief would be against the national interest (50 Fed. Reg. 35205, August 30, 1985). September 3. The USITC revoked a 1983 countervail- ing duty order on imports of certain sugar-containing articles from Australia. September 5. The Commerce Department made a final affirmative subsidy determination on imports of lamb meat from New Zealand, and a countervailing duty of 20 U .S. cents per pound was imposed on such imports. September 7. The President announced the initiation by the U .S. Trade Representative of unfair trade prac- tice investigations against Korean insurance practices, Brazilian restrictions in the computer sector, and Japan- ese practices dealing with imports of tobacco products. September 23. The following steps were taken in regard to import items: (a) In a statement on International Trade Policy, the President announced, inter alia, plans to combat "unfair" foreign trade practices, including the formation of an interagency "strike force" to spearhead an intensified effort against foreign subsidies, dump- ing, and other forms of trade abuse. In addition, the Administration would request Congress to authorize US$300 million for a special fund for export promotion, which would support up to US$1 billion in mixed credit loans for U .S. exports, (b) The Commerce Depart- UNITED STATES ment made a final determination that imports of barbed wire and barbless fencing wire from Argentina were being sold in the United States at less than fair value (50 Fed. Reg. 38563, September 23, 1985); the USITC subsequently made a final determination that such imports were materially injuring a domestic industry, and antidumping duties were imposed on the specified items. October 1. The USITC found that a U .S. industry was being materially injured by subsidized imports of ag- ricultural tillage disc blades from Brazil, but that no injury was being caused by other imports of agricultural tillage tools from the same country. October 2. The USDA announced tighter import procedures for citrus leaves and peels, in an effort to identify illegally imported products that could carry diseases into U .S. growing areas. October 11. The importation of South African kruger- rands was banned, effective October 11, 1985 (50 Fed. Reg. 41682, October 15, 1985). October 16. As additional steps to halt "unfair trade practices" by other countries, the President instructed the USTR to initiate proceedings under the GATT against EC subsidies on wheat, and to investigate, under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, intellectual property rights protection by the Republic of Korea. October 21. The Commerce Department made a final ruling that low-fuming brazing copper rod and wire from New Zealand was being sold in the United States at less than fair value (50 Fed. Reg. 42580, October 21, 1985). Dumping margins ranging from 19.5 percent to 38.5 percent were identified, with the weighted average margin of 26.93 percent. It also found that certain benefits that constituted subsidies within the meaning of the countervailing duty law were being provided to Canadian producers or exporters of red raspberries (50 Fed. Reg. 42574, October 21, 1985). October 22. Extension of U.S. participation in the International Wheat Agreement through June 30, 1986 was approved by the U .S. Senate. October 25. The Commerce Department issued a final determination that cellular mobile telephones and sub- assemblies from Japan were being sold in the United States at less than fair value, and the USITC on November 26 found that such imports were injuring the domestic industry. Antidumping duties were conse- quently imposed on such imports. November 1. The United States reached agreement in principle with the European Communities limiting EC exports of steel products to the United States for the period January 1, 1986 to September 30, 1989. The comprehensive bilateral agreement provided for quan- titative limits on all EC steel products exported to the United States except semifinished steel. It incorporated: (a) carbon steel products under the 1982 bilateral agreement, which was due to expire on December 31, 1985; (b) pipes and tubes covered under the January 1985 agreement (see entry for January 10, above); (c) other steel products covered under the August 1985 529 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution UNITED STATES agreement (see entry for August 5, above); (d) specialty steel products currently subject to unilateral U .S. safe- guard measures under GATT provisions, which were also to be covered by the new bilateral agreement when the U.S. safeguard measures expired; and (e) five other steel products not hitherto subject to restraints. Follow- ing delay in the formal approval by the EC of the above bilateral agreement, the USTR announced on Novem- ber 27 that the United States was suspending immediate delivery privileges for EC steel products other than pipes and tubes arriving at U .S. ports; this measure was revoked on December 5, 1985. The EC formally approved the new agreement on December 11, 1985. Subsequently, on December 30, 1985, the USTR an- nounced a ceiling of 400,000 metric tons per annum on imports from the EC of semifinished steel during the period January 1, 1986 to September 30, 1989. An additional 200,000 metric tons of semifinished steel could be imported annually from the EC at the discretion of the USTR, as a way to make allowances for a long- term contract between the British Steel Corporation and Tuscaloosa Steel of Alabama. November 12. The USTR announced that the United States, Canada, and Japan had agreed to eliminate import tariffs on computer parts, in a move to liberalize and internationalize trade in high-technology products. The agreement called for the United States to terminate the (4.3 percent) import duties on all computer parts other than imports of items using cathode-ray tubes. November 15. The United States and Israel initialed a long-term agreement for the export of Israeli textiles to the United States, which would be in force until 1990, with an option of extension for an additional five-year period. November 19. The President banned imports into the United States of Libyan refined petroleum products (50 Fed. Reg. 47527, November 19, 1985). The prod- ucts covered by the ban included those classified under item numbers 475.05, 475.10, 475.15, 475.25, 475.30, 475.35, 475.45, 475.65, and 475.70 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States. November 6. The USTR announced that Portugal would be deleted from the list of countries eligible for GSP benefits offered by the United States when it joined the European Community on January 1, 1986. (Under U.S. law, member countries of the European Commu- nity are ineligible for GSP benefits.) November 20. The USITC issued a final affirmative ruling under Section 735(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930 that a domestic industry was being injured by imports of low- fuming brazing copper wire rod from New Zealand (see also entry for October 21, 1985). Antidumping duties were consequently assessed against such imports. November 27. The USITC made a final affirmative ruling that imports of photo albums and photo album filler pages from Hong Kong and the Republic of Korea were materially injuring a domestic industry. The Com- merce Department had earlier made a final determination that such imports were being sold at less than fair value 530 in the United States. Antidumping duties were therefore imposed on the affected items from the specified sources. November 29. The Commerce Department announced that countervailing duties would be assessed against imports of rebar (deformed steel concrete reinforcing bar) from Peru, following a final affirmative determina- tion that such imports were being subsidized by the Peruvian Government. December 4. The Commerce Department made a final determination that imports of rock salt from Canada were being sold in the United States at less than fair value, and the case was referred to the USITC for a determination on injury. December 20. It was announced that U .S. exports of leather, leather footwear, and a variety of other products, including paper, f i lm, and telecommunications equip- ment to Japan would be given improved market opportu- nities, as an offset to Japanese restrictions on imports of leather and leather footwear from the United States. In addition, the United States also announced its intention to increase by 40 percent the tariffs on imports from Japan of most leather and leather footwear items. December 23. The President vetoed the Textile and Apparel Trade Enforcement Bill, which had been ap- proved earlier by the U .S. Congress and which had called, inter alia, for new import quotas on textiles and apparel and certain other products. Exports and Export Proceeds January 1. The revised commodity control list main- tained by the Office of Export Administration in the Commerce Department came into effect.

Reg. 50608, December 31, 1984, eased export controls on the sale of less sophisticated personal computers and tightened restrictions on the export of more sophisticated computer technology to the U .S .S .R. and its allies in the Warsaw Pact. The revisions resulted from a review of strategic controls maintained by the United States and certain allied countries through the Coordinating Committee (COCOM). The regulations represented a new element in export controls, requiring for the first time COCOM's review of computer pro- grams (software) in addition to the actual computers themselves (hardware). There was also a change in export procedures whereby exporters would be allowed to use the same Shipper's Declaration for shipment of both software and the media on which the software was contained. January 11. The Commerce Department issued the final rule implementing Title III of the Export Trading Company Act (50 Fed. Reg. 1804, January 11, 1985). The final rule established the procedures by which the Secretary of Commerce would issue export trade certifi- cates of review.

Compared with the interim rules (issued on March 11, 1983, 48 Fed. Reg. 10596), the final rule simplified and clarified the process of reviewing applications. February 26. The USDA announced the cessation of all blended credit export shipments, following a District Court ruling stating that blended credit sales abroad came under the nation's cargo preference laws. (The Blended Credit Program was a combination of Agricul- ture Department direct credits under its GSM-5 program and export guarantees under the GSM-102 program.) April 1. The USDA issued revised country and commodity allocations for fiscal 1985 under Titles I and III of PL 480 (Food for Peace Program). The revised allocations met the legal requirement that not less than 75 percent of food aid commodities be allocated to friendly countries that met the poverty criterion set by the International Development Association. April 12. The Commerce Department changed the distribution license procedure to require quarterly rather than monthly reporting for exports destined for Switzer- land and Yugoslavia (49 Fed. Reg. 14373, April 12, 1985). The new rule, which amended Section 373.3 of the Export Administration Regulations, was intended to reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens. April 24. The Commerce Department amended, effec- tive April 30, 1985, export controls on software and computers. Such controls were eased, with the exception of certain destinations. Also amended was the distribu- tion license program, thereby saving U .S. exporters from having to obtain an export license for each shipment of a security-sensitive product. Under the rules, companies would have to maintain their own internal control programs, which should be approved and audited by the Commerce Department. April 29. The Commerce Department imposed a licensing requirement on exports and re-exports of certain helicopters to all destinations in order to prevent violations of the ban on exports to specified countries (Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Cuba, Demo- cratic Kampuchea, and Viet Nam ). The licensing re- quirement would last 90 days, during which the export policy on commercial helicopters would be reviewed. May 7. A licensing requirement was introduced on exports to (as well as imports from) Nicaragua. May 15. The USDA announced a three-year farm export enhancement program to subsidize agricultural exports by providing in-kind bonus payments of com- modities held by the Commodity Credit Corporation; stocks worth up to US$2 billion would be made available for such subsidies. The program was designed to enable U.S. exporters to regain markets lost to "unfair foreign competition." The program would be targeted to specific markets, particularly those where imports from third countries were subsidized. May 23. The Commerce Department announced final UNITED STATES regulations, effective J u ly 23, to strengthen its distribu- tion license program (50 Fed. Reg. 21562, May 24, 1985). (Distribution licensing is a special license proce- dure authorizing multiple export shipments of controlled commodities.) Holders of distribution licenses were required to design internal controls on the distribution of their products, inc lud ing checking on the reliability of resellers and consumers. June 14. Following earlier agreement between the United States and Canada to liberalize energy trade with each other, the President lifted a ban on exports of U .S. oil to Canada (50 Fed. Reg. 25189, June 16, 1985). July 12. The President signed the Export Administra- tion Act (EAA), fo l low ing its passage by Congress on June 27. The EAA was a renewal of the Export Administration Act of 1979, w i th some modifications. The Act provided the Administration with authority to control exports for national security, foreign policy, and supply-related reasons. Compared w i th the past export controls law, the new legislation relaxed export licensing rules for U .S. companies doing business with U .S. allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Japan, and introduced some constraints on the Pres- ident's power to impose export embargoes for foreign policy purposes. Accordingly, companies would be able to continue exporting goods contracted before an em- bargo was applied. The legislation also included guide- lines aimed at encouraging the administration to grant export licenses when essentially the same product was available to foreign buyers from non -U .S. sources. The U .S. Commerce Department and the U .S. Customs Service would share enforcement authority. For export control violators, the new legislation toughened penalties and went well beyond previous laws by authorizing the cutoff of imports from foreign companies contravening U .S. national security sanctions. The President also terminated the emergency authority for export controls in force since 1984, dur ing the period that the EAA of 1979 had lapsed. July 22. The President rejected an appeal from a domestic industry for relief under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 against the practices of the member states of the European Space Agency with respect to commercial satellite launch ing services, on grounds that such practices were not unreasonable. August 9. The Commerce Department published an interim rule placing underwater photographic cameras and equipment under export controls for national secu- rity reasons, w i th effect from August 7, 1985 (50 Fed. Reg. 32169, August 9, 1985). September 5. To prevent fraudu lent practices the USDA announced tighter controls on re-export of refined sugar from the United States, inc lud ing additional document requirements (50 Fed. Reg. 36037, Septem- ber 5, 1985). September 9. The President announced a range of sanctions against South Africa, inc lud ing a ban on computer exports to agencies involved in the enforce- ment of apartheid and to the security forces; a ban on 531 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution UNITED STATES nuclear exports, with specified exceptions; and a ban on bank loans to the South African Government or its controlled entities. October 16. The White House announced that negoti- ations between the American Institute in Taiwant and the Coordination Council for North American Affairs had resulted in an agreement by Taiwant to improve access to its market for U .S. beer, wine, and cigarettes. December 77. The Commerce Department announced that the United States and other members of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Con- trols had agreed to a further easing of screening requirements for exports to the People's Republic of China; under the new policy, exports in 27 categories, including semiconductors and certain computers, would be permitted without review. Capital January 17. The Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations (T.D. 8006) implementing a 1981 law easing the rules for taxing U .S. citizens living and working abroad. The regulations provided greater flexibility in allocating moving expense reimbursements, and liber- alized filing rules. March 14. The United States and Sri Lanka signed a new income tax treaty. April 9. The U.S. Export-Import Bank announced that it was offering a new short-term insurance facility to tSee Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part Two, page 75. encourage commercial bank financing of U .S. export sales. June 17. The United States and Tunisia signed a new income tax treaty. July 22. The United States and Morocco signed a bilateral investment treaty, which guaranteed U .S. in- vestors in Morocco national treatment in several areas and assured them of access to an outside arbitration panel in the event of major disputes with the Government. The two countries also signed a bilateral tourism agreement. September 9. The President prohibited financial in- stitutions from making loans or extending credit to the South African Government or its controlled entities (50 Fed. Reg. 36861, September 10, 1985). September 24. Following approval by the U .S. Securi- ties and Exchange Commission, the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) and the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) inaugurated the first cross-border electronic trad- ing link between the two major equity markets. Trading would be initially confined to six dually listed stocks and could be carried out either in U .S. dollars or in Canadian dollars. December 3. The United States initialed a bilateral investment treaty with Turkey. Gold December 2. A bill authorizing the Treasury to mint gold coins was passed by the House of Representatives, following passage of the bill by the Senate on November 14, 1985. The bill was signed into law by the President on December 17, 1985. 532 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution URUGUAY (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Uruguay is the Uruguayan New Peso. Uruguay follows a floating exchange rate policy under which the exchange rate of the Uruguayan new peso is determined by market forces, although the Central Bank reserves the right in principle to intervene for the purpose of preventing disorderly conditions in the exchange market. Buying and selling interbank rates for the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, on December 31, 1985 were NUr$124.75 and NUr$125.00, respectively, per US$1. Rates for other currencies are based on U .S. dollar rates in exchange markets abroad. A tax of 1.5 percent is levied on sales of foreign exchange in both the spot and forward exchange mar- kets, if a transaction is settled in Uruguayan new pesos; the tax rate is 0.3 percent for sales of foreign exchange through interbank operations. Export proceeds are not required to be surrendered to the Central Bank. There are no limits on the amount of foreign exchange that the Central Bank may sell to or buy from the Bank of the Republic, the Mortgage Bank, commercial banks, and banking and exchange houses. Uruguay formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2 , 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from May 2, 1980. Administration of Control Exchange transactions are carried out through autho- rized banks, banking houses, exchange houses, and the Bank of the Republic. Any person or firm may conduct exchange transactions in the market. Exchange houses must be authorized by the Central Bank. Prescription of Currency Payments between Uruguay and the countries with which Uruguay has concluded reciprocal credit agree- ments may be made through accounts maintained w i th each other by the central banks, within the framework of the multilateral clearing system of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA); these countries are Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, and Venezuela. There are separate arrangements for trade in specified goods with Argentina and Brazil. All settlements are made in U .S. dollars or other convertible currencies. Imports and Import Payments All imports are subject to registration before the goods are shipped. The registrations are generally valid for 180 days, within which period goods must be cleared through customs. Most imports are subject to import surcharges. The surcharge rates are within a range of 10-55 percent and are payable to the Bank of the Republic at the time of registration. The Bank of the Republic also collects consular charges. Full or partial exemption from these surcharges is granted for imports from member countries of the LAI A, imports of agricultural inputs, imports by the public sector, imports of capital goods, and imports under the temporary admission scheme. Most imports are subject to a customs tariff (impuesto aduanero unico, IMADUNI) and a service charge (tasa de movilizacion de bultos, TMB), collected by the Customs Office. Tariff rates vary between 0 percent and 15 per- cent. The service charge is 1 percent of the c . i . f. import price for most imports. There are exemptions to the IMADUNI and the TMB. Most imports are subject to a 4 percent consular charge calculated on the f .o .b. value; the charges are 3 !/2 percent for private sector imports of petroleum and petroleum products, alcohol, and tetra- ethyl lead; 1A percent for imports of the same commodi- ties by the State Oil, Alcohol, and Cement Company (ANCAP); l/2 percent for other imports by ANCAP; and 4 percent for all other private sector imports. Import surcharges, IMADUN I, and TMB are calculated either on an officially assessed price (precio de referen- da), which usua l ly is expressed in U .S. dollars, or on the actual c . i . f. value, whichever is higher. Payments for Invisibles There are no limitations on the export of foreign or domestic bank notes. Exports and Export Proceeds Foreign exchange proceeds from exports must be sold to the banks not later than 36 months after the expiration date of shipping documents. Exporters are eligible for rebates in respect of indirect taxes paid during the production process; these rebates replaced the system of tax credit certificates with effect from January 1, 1983. From time to time, and for special reasons (e .g ., stock position, protection, sanitary, or military strategy), certain exports are forbidden or made subject to special conditions. Traditional exports such as meat (mutton, beef, and horse), greasy wool (scoured and semiscoured), dry, salted, and pickled hides, and livestock on the hoof (except that of pedigree or pure crossbred), are subject to an export tax at the rate of 5 percent. Fish exports are eligible for tax credit certificates amounting to 3 percent, 6 percent, or 11 percent of the f .o .b. value of exports, which can be used by the exporter to pay taxes, social security contributions, or be sold to a third party. Proceeds from Invisibles There are no surrender requirements on the proceeds from invisibles, and there are no limitations on the import of foreign or domestic bank notes. 533 ©International Monetary Fund.

A system of tax credit certificates was introduced for fish producers, under which fish exporters were made eligible for certificates amounting to 3 percent, 6 percent, or 11 percent of the f .o .b. value of exports, depending on the type of product exported; the certificate could be used to discharge domestic tax liabilities, to pay social security contributions, or it could be sold to a third party. 534 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution VANUATU (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Vanuatu is the Va tu, pegged to the SDR at a rate of VT 110 = SDR 1. At present the Central Bank of Vanuatu does not buy or sell foreign exchange. As a transitional arrangement, the Banque Indosuez Vanuatu, which is at present the Government's main depository, quotes daily the rates of the vatu against 11 currenciesl on the basis of their respective values in terms of the SDR. In its purchases and sales of va tu, the Banque Indosuez Vanuatu applies a margin of up to 1 percent over the international commercial buy ing and selling rates for the respective currencies in terms of the SDR. The overall size of the spread in the local market therefore reflects differences between buying and selling rates for foreign currencies in the international market and the Banque Indosuez Vanua tu 's margin of 1 percent. On December 31, 1985 the f ix ing buying and selling rates for the vatu (for telegraphic transfers) were VT 99.19 per US$1 and VT 101.36 per US$1, respec- tively. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Vanuatu formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from December 1, 1982. Prescription of Currency There are no prescription of currency requirements. Nonresident Accounts No distinction is made between accounts of residents and nonresidents. Debits and credits to all accounts may be made freely. Imports and Import Payments With the exception of specified minor quantitative restrictions, all items may be freely imported. Imports of arms, ammunition, narcotic drugs, seeds, uncooked meat, eggs, and live animals are restricted and subject to authorization. For the island of Efate, potato imports are seasonally prohibited, usually lasting for six months from September to February; in addition, imports of frozen whole chickens and chicken pieces (other than wings) are prohibited. Import duties are levied mainly on an ad valorem basis ( c . i . f .) on most imports. The customs import tariff is structured to charge duties and service taxes at importation. Some goods are free of du ty but are subject to varying rates of service tax. For example, 'Au s t ra l ian dollar, French franc, CFP franc, Fiji dollar, deutsche mark, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen, New Zealand dollar, pound sterling, Singapore dollar, and U .S. dollar. live animals, cereals, and medicines are subject to a 5 percent rate of service tax. Under a special duty-free facility, goods that are attractive to tourists, such as photographic equipment, watches, audio equipment, fu rs, sporting goods, etc., are liable to service tax at a preferential rate of 12 percent, applicable to visitors as well as residents; the preferential rates are scheduled to be phased out as the commodity coverage of the Downtown Duty-Free Shopping Scheme is widened to cover a wider range of goods, and higher duties will be levied on residents' purchases of luxury goods that are currently du ty free. Payments for Invisibles There are no restrictions on payments for invisibles. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange proceeds from surrendered. invisibles need not be Exports and Export Proceeds With a few exceptions, no restrictions are applied on exports. Exports of trochus, green snails, beches-de- mer, and crustaceans2 are subject to authorization by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry. Copra and cocoa exports are channeled through the Vanuatu Commodities Marketing Board (VCMB), and exports of coffee are subject to authorization from the VCMB. Artifacts that are five years old or more are subject to authorization from the Cultural Centre. Most exports are subject to export duties, mainly on an ad valorem basis ( f .o .b . ); specific duties are levied on some minor exports, including scrap metal and timber. Export duties on copra are on a sliding-scale basis, that is, higher rates for higher un it values. There are no surrender requirements for export proceeds. Capital All inward and outward movements of capital are unrestricted. Gold There are no restrictions on gold transactions. Changes During 1985 Imports and Import Payments August 10.

Not for Redistribution VENEZUELA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement1 The currency of Venezuela is the Venezuelan Bolivar. Venezuela maintains a four-tier exchange rate system under which three of the exchange rates are pegged to the^ U .S. dollar and the fourth is a fluctuating rate. In the first market, the Central Bank sells foreign exchange to the public in eligible cases at the rate of Bs 4.30 = US$1. The Central Bank may also sell foreign exchange at Bs 4.2925 = US$1 to banks, which may in turn sell to their customers at a rate of Bs 4.30 = US$1. Eligible payments at this preferential rate include those for (a) interest on private external debt authorized by the Differential Exchange System Office (RECADI) that fell due before December 31, 1983; (b) interest on foreign debt of public sector entities not directly serviced by the Central Government and that fell due before Decem- ber 31, 1983; (c) amortization of foreign debt of public sector entities not directly serviced by the Central Government; and (d) amortization of authorized and registered private debt (defined as net liability position) under US$500,000, or, if higher, when rescheduled over seven years, with two years' grace. In the second market, the Central Bank buys foreign exchange at the rate of Bs 5.9925 = US$1 from the national petroleum and iron ore companies, and sells foreign exchange to these companies at the rate of Bs 6.00 = US$1 for all their current and capital transactions. In the third market, the Central Bank buys foreign ex- change at the rate of Bs 7.4925 = US$1 from the Ven- ezuelan Investment Fund and from public entities that have obtained foreign exchange for reasons other than exports of goods and services; it sells foreign exchange in the same market to the public at the rate of Bs 7.50 = US$1, and to banks at the rate of Bs 7.4925 = US$1, when the banks act as intermediaries for the purpose of: (a) interest payments on external public and private sector debt registered at RECADI and falling due after December 31, 1983; (b) imports of goods and services other than "essential" foodstuffs and medicines (includ- ing related freight and insurance), for which the sale of foreign exchange has been authorized by RECADI; (c) public sector current payments abroad and payments related to international commitments of the Government of Venezuela; (d) interest and amortization payments on external debt contracted or serviced by the Central Government; (e) outward remittances to students; and (f) foreign exchange purchases by the Venezuelan Investment Fund. All other transactions take place lOn December 27, 1985, and with effect from January 1, 1986, the Venezuelan authorities modified their exchange arrangement, such that essential import items and specified invisibles eligible for financing at the rate of Bs 4.30 = US$1 and all transactions settled at the rate of Bs 6.00 = US$1 were required to be settled at the rate of Bs 7.50 = US$1. through the free market at a freely fluctuating rate, except that, in the case of exports of goods and services containing imported inputs, foreign exchange equivalent to 50 percent of the value of the portion of foreign inputs in the f .o .b. value of the exported goods and services purchased at Bs 7.50 = US$1 should be sold to the Central Bank at the same rate. The Central Bank may buy and sell foreign exchange at the fluctuating rate market, which operates through financial intermediaries. The banks and exchange houses in this market may establish different exchange rates according to the instrument being transacted, but the spread between buying and selling rates for the same instrument may not exceed Bs 0.05 per US$1 in the case of banks and Bs 0.15 in the case of exchange houses. On Decem- ber 31, 1985 the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar at the foreign exchange houses were Bs 14.40 = US$1 and Bs 14.45 = US$1, respectively. Buying and selling rates for other officially quoted currencies2 are based, for each market, on the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar in major markets abroad. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. In the case of interbank transfers, domestic banks may charge only the cost of the transfer, including commission and other charges by the foreign banks. Venezuela formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agree- ment, on July 1, 1976. Administration of Control Foreign exchange policies are established by the Ministry of Finance, with the advice of the Differential Exchange System Advisory Committee. The committee is chaired by the Minister of Finance and includes the Minister of Development, the Minister of Agriculture and Livestock, the Minister of the Central Coordination and Planning Office, the President of the Central Bank of Venezuela, and the President of the Venezuelan Invest- ment Fund. The exchange control system is administered by the Central Bank and RECADI, the head of which serves as secretary to the Differential Exchange System Advisory Committee. Import and export licenses are generally issued by the Ministry of Development or the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, depending on the commodity. Import quotas and prohibitions within the multiple exchange rate system are established by the Ministry of Finance. The Superintendency of Foreign Investments (SIEX) exercises supervision over foreign investment in Venezuela, over contracts for the 2Canadian dollar, deutsche mark, French franc, Italian lira, Japanese yen, Portugese escudo, pound sterling, Spanish peseta, and Swiss franc. 537 ©International Monetary Fund.

Imports and Import Payments Imports from South Africa are prohibited. In addition, importation of certain goods is either prohibited or reserved for the Government; these include iron and steel products, luxury food, apparel, and specified consumer durables. Certain other commodities also require import licenses. For protective purposes, quantitative restric- tions are maintained on some of these items, irrespective of origin, except in the case of Andean Pact and LAI A member countries. Licenses are valid for all countries except South Africa. Import licenses for some goods are issued on evidence that the importer has purchased domestic products equal to a prescribed percentage of the quantity to be imported. Payments for imports by the national petroleum and iron ore companies may be made at the rate of Bs 6.00 = US$1. All other goods which are not prohibited, reserved for the public sector, or subject to special regimes may be imported at the rate of Bs 7.50 = US$1 when authorized by RECADI, or at the free market rate. Imports into the free port of Margarita Island and those of a small list of products (alcoholic beverages) must be made at the free market rate. To have access to foreign exchange from the Central Bank for payment of imports, an importer must obtain an import license (Conformidad de Importation) from RECADI before the date of shipment of the goods; the license has a validity of 180 days, and may be renewed up to a period determined by RECADI in each specific case. At the time the above license is granted, RECADI also issues an exchange authorization license (Autorizacion para la Obtencion de Divisas). RECADI is authorized to impose advance import deposits in domestic currency of up to 100 percent of the value of the foreign exchange application. Imports for the government sector are controlled by a commission established by Decree No. 2166 (May 26, 1977) that has the power of prior authorization over all public sector imports. This authorization is needed in order to obtain letters of credit, exemption from import duties, and, if necessary, f inanc ing. By Decree No. 2664 (April 28, 1978), the Foreign Trade Institute was appointed as the technical coordinator of the commission. In accordance with the timetable issued by the Andean Pact Commission, contained in the Protocol of Lima, Venezuela adopted the m in imum external tariff in 1978 538 (Decree No. 2772 of August 3, 1978). It has also agreed, in principle, to harmonize external tariffs and eliminate all import duties on trade within the Andean subregion by December 31, 1983, in the prescribed annual stages. Payments for Invisibles Payments for the following categories of invisibles are allowed to be made through the preferential rate of Bs 4.30 = US$1: interest payments on external debt of public entities not serviced by the Central Government and on external private debt authorized by RECADI falling due before December 31, 1983. Invisible payments by the national petroleum and iron ore companies are made at the rate of Bs 6.00 = US$1. Payments for the following categories of invisibles are required to be made at the rate of Bs 7.50 = US$1: (a) freight and insurance associated with imports made at this rate; (b) interest on the public and registered private external debt falling due after December 31, 1983; (c) interest on the external debt of the Central Government or serviced by the Central Government; (d) other public sector current payments abroad; and (e) outward remittances to students. Other payments for invisibles can be made through the free market, without limit. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. Exports of certain furs and hides, scrap metal, and a few other commodities are prohibited. Licenses are required for the export of commodities subject to price controls or deemed to be in short supply domestically; for most commodities such licenses are issued by the Ministry of Development, but those for coffee, cacao, rice, and sugar are granted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock. The export of precious stones and gold requires an export license issued by the Ministry of Finance. All export earnings by companies dealing in gold must be surrendered to the Central Bank at the exchange rate it uses for its operations in the free market. In the case of private exporters, the authorization to export is contingent on agreement to sell export proceeds to authorized banks within 30 days of shipment in the case of cash exports, and within 10 days of the due payment date in the case of exports on credit. Export earnings by companies active in the extraction and marketing of hydrocarbons and the mining of iron ore must be surrendered to the Central Bank at the rate of Bs 5.9925 = US$1. All other export earnings may be sold in the freely fluctuating market; when such earnings are sold to the Central Bank, the applicable exchange rate is the rate used by the Central Bank for its operations in the free market. In the case of export items containing imported inputs purchased at Bs 7.50 = US$1, an amount of foreign exchange equivalent to one half of the imported component of the f .o .b. value of exports must be sold to the Central Bank at the rate of Bs 7.50 = US$1. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Exporters of coffee and cacao may receive an export subsidy calculated to prevent the f .o .b. bolivar prices of these products in Venezuelan ports from falling below specified minimum amounts regardless of external prices. In principle, the benefit of these arrangements may be extended to firms processing domestic coffee or cacao for export. The promotion of nontraditional exports in Venezuela takes two basic forms: first, the Export Financing Fund, established in September 1973, provides direct credit facilities at interest rates below those charged by other lenders, and it also lends in conjunction with commercial banks; second, the Export Incentive Law (September 1973) assists nontraditional exports through fiscal subsidies in the form of tax credit certificates. Under the Export Incentive Law, negotiable tax credit certificates with a two-year maturity are granted to exporters of nontraditional products (i.e., exports other than petroleum, iron ore, coffee, and cacao) that have a domestic value added greater than 30 percent. These certificates can be held to maturity and used to meet government tax liabilities, or can be traded in the local market at a discount. For the purpose of calculating the amount of the export subsidy, the domestic currency equivalent of the export value is calculated at the rate of Bs 7.50 = US$1. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles are freely dispos- able, except for those of the Venezuelan Investment Fund, the national and local governments (which must be surrendered at the rate of Bs 7.4925 = US$1), and petroleum and iron ore companies (which must be surrendered at Bs 6.00 = US$1). Travelers may freely import domestic and foreign currency, with the excep- tion that importation for commercial purposes of foreign coin other than gold coin is prohibited. Capital The national and local governments, autonomous agencies, and state enterprises (other than petroleum and iron ore companies) are required to surrender to the Central Bank at the rate of Bs 7.4925 = US$1 all exchange proceeds from foreign borrowing; principal repayments on external debt of public sector entities are effected at the rate of Bs 4.30 = US$1, while principal repayments on the external debt contracted or serviced by the Central Government are effected at the rate of Bs 7.50 = US$1. Foreign exchange receipts from capital transactions by the national petroleum and iron ore companies are required to be surrendered to the Central Bank at the rate of Bs 5.9925 = US$1, and payments on capital transactions by these companies are effected at the rate of Bs 6.00 = US$1. All foreign exchange brought into Venezuela by the Venezuelan Investment Fund is subject to conversion at the rate of Bs 7.4925 = US$1. Principal repayments on external private sector debt registered with RECADI can also be effected at the rate of Bs 4.30 = US$1, as long as the debt is rescheduled over seven years with two years of VENEZUELA grace or if the amount is less than US$500,000. Eligible debt for this purpose is defined as the net liability position in foreign exchange as of February 18, 1983 of (1) banking, financial, and insurance companies; and (2) nonfinancial enterprises of mixed or Venezuelan ownership in the areas of manufacturing (if the debt was contracted for the acquisition of capital goods for use within the country), transportation and public services (if the debt was for the acquisition of equipment), and construction (if the debt was incurred for public sector works or works guaranteed by the public sector for social housing projects). All other inward and outward capital transfers for or by residents are permitted without restriction in the freely fluctuating exchange market. However, brokerage activity in Venezuela in shares or units of foreign invest- ment trusts or mutual funds is prohibited. Foreign capital imported for investment purposes and all foreign credits must be registered with SIEX. Foreign direct investment is governed by Andean Pact regulations. Natural gas and iron mining operations are reserved for the State, and foreign investment in the petroleum sector is prohibited. The Central Bank regulates bank credit to nonresidents and companies whose capital is more than 50 percent owned by physical persons or companies that are resident or domiciled abroad. The General Banking Law authorizes the Government to regulate bank credit to companies whose capital is more than 40 percent owned by nonresident or foreign physical persons or companies. This law also regulates the activities of foreign banks operating in Venezuela. Interest earnings on loans extended by foreign financial institutions are exempt from income tax. Gold Venezuelan gold coins are legal tender but do not circulate. Residents may hold, acquire, and sell gold coins in Venezuela for numismatic and investment purposes. The Central Bank does not deal in gold with the public, but gold coin, medallions, and bars are freely negotiated among authorized importers and exchange houses and the public. Commercial banks may freely negotiate gold coin among themselves and with other residents but do not normally deal in gold with the public. Imports and exports of monetary gold are reserved for the Central Bank, as is the import of gold coins that are legal tender in Venezuela. Imports and exports of nonmonetary gold (other than jewelry for personal use) and of gold coins eligible as legal tender in Venezuela or abroad are subject to prior authorization by the Central Bank. In addition, imports require licenses from the Central Bank and in certain cases also from the Minister of Development, while exports require authori- zation by the Central Bank. As an incentive measure, export earnings by companies dealing in gold are converted by the Central Bank at the free market rate. The law prescribes a license for all imports and exports of gold by anyone not registered at the Central Bank as an exporter of gold. Imports of gold are subject to duty at varying rates. 539 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution VENEZUELA Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement December 27. The Venezuelan authorities announced a modification of the exchange arrangement with effect from January 1, 1986. Under the new system, payments for certain essential imports together with related ser- vices and certain remittances to Venezuelan students abroad, hitherto eligible for the rate of Bs 4.30 = US$1, and all current and capital transactions of the national petroleum and iron ore companies, which had been effected at Bs 6.00 = US$1, were required to be settled at the rate of Bs 7.50 = US$1. Imports and Import Payments January through December. The Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank approved periodic transfers during 1985 of import items from those eligible for financing at the rate of Bs 4.30 = US$1 to the rate of Bs 7.50 = US$1. July 12. The Ministry of Finance removed items classified under about 150 customs headings from Legal Import Regimes 2 and 4 (Notas 2 y 4) covering com- modities importable only by the public authorities and those licensed by the Ministry of Development. September 2. The Ministry of Finance removed items under an additional 100 custom headings from Legal Import Regimes 2 and 4. Capital January 18. The Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance approved Exchange Agreement No. 5 (Con- venio Cambiario No. 5), under which certain public sector utilities and financial institutions were made eligible to service their registered external debt at the preferential exchange rate of Bs 4.30 per US$1 through purchase of "zero coupon" foreign bonds. The scheme would allow the debtor (with the agreement of the creditor) to purchase a U .S. zero coupon bond with a 10- to 12-year maturity for the nominal amount of the registered debt; the bond would be transferred to the creditor at maturity. For the purchase of the zero coupon bonds, the Central Bank would provide foreign exchange at the rate of Bs 4.30 = US$1 in an amount not exceeding 30 percent of the registered debt; foreign exchange for interest payments on the debt would be provided by the Central Bank for up to 70 percent of the amount of the registered debt at the same rate of Bs 4.30 = US$1; any remaining interest payments during the life of the loan would be purchased at the current official exchange rate. March 6. The Differential Exchange System Office was authorized to buy immediately (or in accordance with the terms of original obligations) foreign exchange at the preferential rate of Bs 4.30 per US$1 for repayment of (a) registered private external debt related to public sector work contracts held with the national and local government, autonomous agencies, and state enter- prises; and (b) debt guaranteed by foreign export- promotion agencies; in the first case, the debt should fall due on or before December 31, 1985, and in the second case, the originally established maturity should not exceed 1990 (Decree No. 508). 540 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution VIET NAM (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Viet Nam is the New Dong, which replaced the former dong on September 14, 1985 at a ratio of 1 to 10. On December 31, 1985 the official exchange rate of the new dong in terms of the U .S. dollar was D 15 = US$1. Viet Nam participates in the trans- ferable values system; the exchange rate for the transfer- able ruble (TR) has been fixed at D 16.235 = TR 1 since October 1, 1981. Exchange rates of the dong for certain foreign currencies are quoted by the State Bank of Viet Nam on the basis of the cross rates of these currencies against the U .S. dollar. Central import-export corpora- tions receive premiums on their export earnings ranging from D 35 to D 50 per U .S. dollar and from D 30 to D 100 per ruble. A preferential rate of D 20 = rub 1 is applied to inward remittances from Vietnamese workers in the nonconvertible area. Beginning from September 1, 1983, a preferential exchange rate of D 60 = US$1 is applied for inward remittances and transfers from the convertible currency area, replacing the premium of 30-40 percent in effect since 1981; on December 31, 1985 this rate was D 150 = US$1. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the State Bank. Foreign trade is administered by the Ministry of Foreign Trade, which authorizes the foreign trade transactions carried out by specialized state import-export corpora- tions or, in certain cases, cooperatives or state enter- prises. Import and export licenses are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Trade; approval is given for imports in excess of the Plan on the merit of each application. Most foreign exchange transactions are effected by the Bank for Foreign Trade. Most of the foreign exchange transactions related to foreign technical assistance are monitored by the Aid Reception Commission, which is an agency directly attached to the Cabinet of the Prime Minister. Prescription of Currency Trade transactions with member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), Albania, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are settled either through individual bilateral clearing accounts or under the CMEA transferable ruble settlement system (Czecho- slovakia, Cuba, Hungary, Mongolia, and the U .S .S .R . ). As a member of the CMEA, Viet Nam is entitled to use credits in transferable rubles from the International Bank of Economic Cooperation (IBEC) for up to 2 percent of the total volume of transactions specified in the annual trade agreements. Viet Nam also maintains a current account in convertible foreign exchange with the IBEC. Nontrade transactions with countries with which Viet Nam has bilateral payments agreements * take place at exchange rates specified in these agreements. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents are permitted to maintain nonresident accounts either in foreign currencies or in dong. Nonresi- dents can freely reconvert into foreign currency and transfer abroad unused balances in Vietnamese currency that have been acquired against foreign currency. Imports and Exports An import plan and an export plan are drawn up annually on the basis of the overall annual plan and quotas agreed upon under bilateral trade arrangements. In principle, import and export transactions are carried out by about 20 central import-export corporations and about 25 local trading corporations. Local corporations must obtain specific approval from the Ministry of Foreign Trade to import and export. Some of these corporations have their own producing un i ts, while others contract with supplying enterprises. All payments for external trade transactions need the authorization of the State Bank and are made through the Bank for Foreign Trade. Export receipts are normally channeled through the Bank for Foreign Trade, and any other receipts from foreign trade have to be surrendered to the State Bank. Local export companies are permitted to export all available commodities, including the 25 items pre- viously under the monopoly of the central export-import companies. Local corporations may import only com- modities appearing on a list approved by the Ministry of Foreign Trade. In order to make better use of available marketing expertise and facilities, local trading compa- nies in the provinces are permitted to enter into joint venture arrangements with trading companies located in Ho Chi Minh City. Local trading companies may freely determine the domestic prices of exportable commodities and of imported goods. Centrally managed trading companies must obtain approval for these prices. Local trading companies in Ho Chi Minh City are under the overall supervision of a holding organization (IMEXCO) that coordinates all foreign trading activity and arranges for the appropriate financing. An export bonus system has been in operation since 1980 to provide additional incentives for export produc- tion. By fu lf i l l ing plan targets, exporters earn a bonus of 2 percent to 10 percent of the value of planned exports, 'At the end of 1985 Viet Nam had bilateral payments agreements w i th eight countries that were not members of the IMF —Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Mon- golia, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Poland, and the U .S .S .R .; and w i th six IMF members —Bangladesh, the People's Republic of China, the Lao People's Democratic Repub l ic, Mali, Romania, and the Syrian Arab Republic. 541 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution VIET NAM depending on the quality and kind of product; another bonus of 3—5 percent is earned on exports in excess of targets. State enterprises whose export earnings exceed Plan targets can freely import required inputs and certain consumer goods up to the value of such excess. Under an export earnings retention scheme, local trading companies may in principle retain up to 70 percent of their export earnings if they achieve their export quota, and 90 percent of export earnings from that part of the exports that exceeds their export quota. In practice, however, the scheme is not enforced and most trading companies retain 100 percent of their export proceeds. Additional incentives are provided for certain exporters in the form of a right to use for imports a portion of the net earnings (defined as export receipts less the cost of imported goods and interest cost of borrowed foreign exchange) ranging from 30 percent to 90 percent, depending on the quality and type of product. Deposits in foreign currency are held at the Bank for Foreign Trade in the names of exporters, that is, the state-trading companies, or the regional trading companies, or the specialized (joint) state-private agen- cies. These deposits can be used to finance domestic purchases, in which case they are transferred to the name of the seller, and to finance certain nonluxury imports. State enterprises have three export plans (primary, secondary, and tertiary). Primary export plans are formulated by the Government against deliveries of key inputs by the Government; secondary plans are set by the Government but without sufficient supply of inputs (e.g., fuel) by the Government, thus leaving the task of procuring the needed inputs to the enterprises; tertiary plans are set freely by the producing units, which utilize discarded materials. For imports from the nonconvertible area, annual credits in foreign exchange are allocated to importers on the basis of actual production capacity; in principle, such credits cannot be carried over from one year to another. For imports from the convertible area, although a similar foreign exchange allocation system exists in principle, it is not in use, as decisions to allocate foreign exchange are taken by the Prime Minister's Cabinet on a case-by- case basis, upon recommendations from the State Plan- ning Commission, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and specified Vice-Premiers. For transactions under the local production plans, local authorities are authorized to decide on foreign exchange allocation, provided that the resources are derived from their export earnings. Payments for Invisibles All transactions in invisibles require individual auth- orization by the State Bank. Foreign exchange is made available upon authorization of the transaction. All travel 542 abroad needs individual authorization from the Prime Minister's Cabinet, and, at present, is limited to official business for which all foreign exchange expenses are covered. Receipts from transactions in invisibles have to be surrendered to the State Bank within seven days. The export and import of Vietnamese currency and of securities denominated in Vietnamese currency need the special permission of the State Bank. The circulation of foreign currency in the domestic market is prohibited. Legal holders of foreign exchange are authorized to buy foreign and local consumer goods in special government shops. Capital The Foreign Investment Code provides for three forms of foreign investment: (1) investment in the production of goods intended solely for export; (2) joint ventures between a foreign investor and a Vietnamese state economic organization; and (3) production-sharing part- nerships for the exploitation of natural resources. The share of foreign capital that is permitted ranges from 30 percent to 49 percent for joint ventures and up to 100 percent for enterprises specializing in production for export. Other facilities available under the Investment Code include: (a) guarantee against nationalization for up to 15 years; (b) exemption from or reduction of income taxes; (c) possible exemption from or reduction of import duties on capital goods and raw materials for use in joint ventures and on temporary imports; (d) exemption from export duty for export enterprises; and (e) provisions for the establishment of free trade zones. Gold The State Bank alone has the authority to purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad. Physical persons are permitted to own jewelry and artistic and cultural objects of gold for domestic and personal use. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement May 1. The preferential exchange rate applied to inward remittances and transfers from the convertible currency area was adjusted from D 100 = US$1 to D 150 = US$1. September 14. The State Bank of Viet Nam was authorized to issue new Viet Nam dong and to withdraw old dong from circulation. The value of the new currency was set equal to ten times the value of the old dong. September 15. The official exchange rate of the new dong in terms of the U .S. dollar was defined as D 15 = US$1, as against a rate of D 12.06 = US$1 for the old dong. ©International Monetary Fund.

The exchange rate of the tala is determined on the basis of a weighted basket of currencies. On Decem- ber 31, 1985 the buying and selling rates of the tala in terms of the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, were WS$1 = US$0.4386 and WS$1 = US$0.4286, respec- tively. Exchange rates for other currencies are estab- lished on the basis of their daily rates against the U.S. dollar. There is an exchange levy of 1 percent on gross sales of foreign exchange, giving rise to spreads in excess of 2 percent in exchange transactions. Administration of Control Overall responsibility for the administration of ex- change control rests with the Treasury and the Central Bank of Samoa. The daily administration of exchange controls is handled by the Central Bank of Samoa, which may delegate part of its powers to authorized banks. In principle, all payments to nonresidents of Western Samoa require the approval of the Central Bank of Samoa; the Bank of Western Samoa and the Pacific Commercial Bank —the only authorized banks—are em- powered to approve certain payments up to any amount, and certain other payments up to specified amounts. Prescription of Currency There are no prescriptions as to the currencies in which payments to or from nonresidents of Western Samoa must be made or received. Nonresident Accounts No distinction is made between the accounts of residents and nonresidents of Western Samoa. Imports and Import Payments The import of a few commodities is prohibited for reasons of security or health. Other commodities may be imported from any source without restriction, with the exception of items subject to special approval on a case- by-case basis, namely motor vehicles, capital equipment in excess of dutiable values of WS$10,000, and a few items for which there are domestically manufactured substitutes.l Import transactions other than for petroleum products and exceeding WS$5,000 are in each case required to be made under letters of credit. Letters of credit for motor vehicle imports are subject to an advanced deposit requirement of 100 percent. Payments for Invisibles Payments for certain invisibles may be approved by the authorized banks up to specified limits. Payments in excess of these limits, as well as payments for all other invisibles, require the prior approval of the Central Bank. Remittances for study abroad are normally autho- rized. Approval of the Central Bank of Samoa is required in respect of all transfers of local earnings from divi- dends, interest, and pensions of overseas residents. Residents and expatriates traveling overseas for private purposes are entitled to a foreign currency allowance equivalent to WS$100 a person a day, subject to a limit of WS$2,000 a person a year; in the case of travel for business purposes, the daily allowance is WS$200 within a limit of WS$4,000 a trip. The Central Bank of Samoa grants supplementary allocations against evi- dence of genuine need. As part of their foreign currency allowance, resident travelers may take out foreign bank notes equivalent to WS$500 a person. Travelers may not take out any domestic currency. A 15 percent withhold- ing tax is levied on remittances of dividends at the source and interest payments on overseas loans. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports require export licenses issued by the Customs Department. Exports may be prohibited by the Director of Agriculture and the Produce Marketing Division on grounds of low quality, or by order of the Head of State to alleviate domestic shortages. Exports of cocoa are controlled by the Cocoa Board. An export levy of 7 percent is imposed on the f .o .b. value of cocoa.2 Export proceeds must be surrendered to the authorized banks within a reasonable time after shipment. Certificates validated by an authorized bank are required for exports in excess of WS$250. Proceeds from Invisibles All foreign currencies earned by residents in perform- ing services for nonresidents must be surrendered to the authorized banks. Resident travelers must on return sell to the banks all unused foreign currency brought in. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount in foreign bank notes, but may not bring in any domestic bank notes. Capital All outward capital transfers by residents require the specific approval of the Central Bank of Samoa. Inward capital remittances do not normally require approval, but borrowing abroad by nonbank residents does require approval. The authorized banks approve transfers of gifts to relatives and dependents, either for special family occasions or by way of maintenance, up to WS$250 a year a person.

The de facto fixed relationship between the Western Samoa tala and the New Zealand dollar was discontinued, and it was announced that the exchange rate would be determined on the basis of a weighted basket of currencies. In addition, the U .S. dollar replaced the New Zealand dollar as the intervention currency. Imports and Import Payments September 1. The following changes were made in import-related regulations: (a) the threshold amount of import payments above which letters of credit became obligatory was reduced from WS$10,000 to WS$5,000; (b) the interest rate on import financing credit was raised from 18 percent to 21 percent per annum; and (c) the opening of letters of credit for imports of motor vehicles was made subject to a noninterest advance deposit at the Central Bank, amounting to 100 percent of value.

On December 31, 1985 the official buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were YRls 6.47 and YRls 6.50, respectively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates for certain other currencies* are fixed daily by the Central Bank of Yemen in its transactions, on the basis of rates for the U.S. dollar in markets abroad. There is a recognized secondary market operated by commercial banks, at which all transactions other than limited public sector transactions are allowed to take place. The commercial banks set exchange rates in the market in line with normal banking practices, under the supervision and approval of the Central Bank. At the end of 1985, the rate in that market fluctuated around YRls 8 = US$ 1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control A foreign exchange budget is established by the Central Bank in parallel with a commodity budget prepared by the appropriate ministries in consultation with the Central Bank. All imports require a license issued by the Ministry of Economy and Industry or the Ministry of Commerce and Supply. The Ministry of Economy and Industry issues licenses for raw materials, machinery, equipment and spare parts for industry, and the Ministry of Commerce and Supply issues import licenses for all other items. Transactions in invisibles are supervised by the Central Bank. All commercial banks operate in foreign exchange; operations by private exchange dealers are limited to the buying and selling of foreign currencies.

Subject to Central Bank approval, importers may use up to 50 percent of their own foreign currency deposits as of April 20, 1985 and August 31, 1985, to finance imports of foodstuffs, petroleum products, medical supplies, industrial inputs, and spare parts, as well as to settle outstanding import obligations. The commercial bank purchase committee is required to set aside up to 15 percent of its foreign exchange purchases for the purpose of financing certain import items as specified by the Central Bank. In addition to the applicable customs duty, imports are subject to a defense tax of 5 percent, a statistical tax of 2 percent, and a tax of 1 percent for reconstruction related to earthquake damage.

Buying and selling rates for the pound sterling are also officially quoted by the National Bank of Yemen (the sole commercial bank and authorized dealer), with daily quotations based on the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar in markets abroad. On December 31, 1985 the National Bank of Yemen's buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were YD 0.343 and YD 0.350, respectively, per US$1. Rates for all other prescribed currencies are quoted weekly; additional adjustments are made when there are major changes in the market rates for these currencies in London and New York the previous day. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control The administration of exchange control is carried out by the General Department for Exchange Control of the Bank of Yemen (the central bank) through the Foreign Exchange Committee, which has delegated certain pow- ers to the Director of Exchange Control, a member of that Committee. The Ministry of Trade and Supply issues import and export licenses; those for gold and other precious metals require the prior approval of the Director of Exchange Control. Exchange transactions must be carried out through the National Bank of Yemen. Other dealers in foreign exchange, who may deal only in traveler's checks and bank notes, are classified into ordinary money changers and secondary dealers. Ordi- nary money changers, whose principal business is to sell and purchase foreign exchange for their own account or for the account of the National Bank, are permitted to deal in specified currencies. Secondary dealers, such as hotels, travel bureaus, and retail stores selling tourist goods, are permitted to accept payment in foreign exchange only from their customers and are required to surrender the receipts in foreign exchange to the National Bank not later than the following business day. While the authorized bank and money changers are allowed to charge a commission for the purchase and sale of foreign exchange as specified by the Committee, secondary dealers may not do so. Except for payments for imports against letters of credit or documents, which may be approved by the authorized dealer, all payments for imports (including those of precious metals) require the prior approval of the Director of Exchange Control. Certain public cor- porations are engaged in foreign trade (see section on Imports and Import Payments, below). Prescription of Currency Exchange transactions must be carried out through the authorized dealer in accordance with prescription of currency regulations. All payments to Israel are pro- hibited. Export proceeds and certain receipts from invisibles must be received in convertible currencies and surrendered to the authorized dealer; proceeds from exports or re-exports to specified neighboring countries may be surrendered in the currencies of such countries. Payments for imports must be made in prescribed currencies. Nonresident Accounts External Accounts in Yemeni dinars may be credited with proceeds from convertible foreign currency trans- ferred from abroad, with bank interest payable on such accounts, and with balances from other External Ac- counts. Transfers from abroad must be in the form of bank drafts; the accounts may not be credited with payments in the form of foreign bank notes (unless they have been declared to the customs on entry), or with locally raised or locally earned funds (except in certain specified cases). External Accounts may be debited for any payments to residents, for transfers to other External Accounts, and for payments abroad in any convertible currency. Transfers abroad from External Accounts in Yemeni dinars require the prior approval of the Ex- change Control Department. The Foreign Exchange Committee may direct any payment to a nonresident to a Blocked Account. Except with the Committee's prior approval, Blocked Accounts may be debited only for purchases of specified securities. Yemeni nationals working abroad may establish non- resident accounts in foreign currencies; balances in these accounts earn interest and are convertible into foreign currency on demand. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Israel are prohibited. Imports of cars other than those needed for development projects are also prohibited. All imports require individual licenses. Goods originating in the Yemen Arab Republic are exempt from the licensing requirements. There is an annual import program.

The "Inducement to Invest Law" divides foreign investments into two cate- gories: (1) projects which realize self-sufficiency in their requirements for foreign currency; these may remit net annual profits due on invested capital within the limit of the credit of their exports; and (2) projects of primary importance for the national economy; these may remit the whole of the annual net profits due on capital invested. Projects that were set up prior to 1971 may remit all of their net profit. The basic exchange allow- ance for tourism is the equivalent of YD 125 a person a trip to all destinations (50 percent of this amount for children aged between 2 and 10 years). Allowances for medical treatment abroad are normally granted in accor- dance with the amount estimated by the Ministry of Health. Allowances for other types of travel are granted on the merits of the application. Foreign employees of approved enterprises are allowed to remit abroad be- tween 50 percent and 100 percent of their total earnings (net of taxes) according to the terms of the contract; other foreign employees, if receiving their salaries from abroad, are allowed to remit 70 percent of their total earnings. Nonnationals doing business in the country can remit abroad up to YD 50 a month for family mainte- nance. All insurance is nationalized; existing policies have been transferred to the National Insurance and Reinsurance Company, and payments abroad in respect of premiums are not permitted. Travelers may take out the equivalent of YD 5 in domestic bank notes and up to the equivalent of YD 125 in traveler's checks, foreign bank notes, or other foreign means of payment. Nonresi- dents may take out any foreign exchange declared upon entry. Exports and Export Proceeds Most exports are subject to individual licensing. All exports to Israel are prohibited. Except for exports to neighboring countries specified by the Foreign Exchange 548 Committee, export proceeds must be received in con- vertible currencies within six months of shipment and must be sold to authorized dealers upon receipt. Pro- ceeds of exports or re-exports to neighboring countries may be surrendered in the national currency of the importing country. Proceeds from Invisibles All claims of residents for services rendered to nonresidents must be collected in foreign currency (or received from an External Account) and surrendered to the authorized dealer. Travelers may freely bring in foreign bank notes; imports of more than YD 5 in domestic currency are subject to a tax of 50 percent. Tourists are required to spend in foreign exchange an amount equivalent to YD 50 a month or US$10 a day if the duration of their stay is less than one month. Capital Virtually all capital payments and transactions require prior approval. Expatriates are normally permitted upon departure to remit their entire savings to their country of permanent residence. Foreign investments that have been approved under the Inducement to Invest Law (enacted in 1981) may be granted exemptions from import duty and various other tax facilities. Five years after investment, the net value of the enterprise (cal- culated on the basis of assignment, actual liquidation, or book value, whichever is less) is transferable at the rate of 25 percent a year; if, however, the owner of the Yemeni, Arab, or foreign capital encounters operational difficulties, his capital may, upon approval, be retrans- ferred to its place of origin one year after entry. This provision also applies to the reinvested part of such capital. Interest due on any loans obtained abroad after the firm concerned has been established may also be remitted, provided that all duties, taxes, and other government dues have been paid. Projects authorized under this law are exempt from income tax for up to five years from the commencement of production and may carry losses forward. Gold Only the monetary authorities and authorized dealers may purchase, hold, or sell gold bullion. Licensed goldsmiths may purchase, hold, and sell other unworked gold and gold coin and ornaments. Other residents may hold gold in the form of ornaments or numismatic coins. Exports and imports of gold by registered goldsmiths require licenses issued by the Ministry of Trade and Supply (General Department for Foreign Trade); in certain cases, the consent of the Foreign Exchange Committee must also be obtained. Departing female residents may take out gold ornaments not exceeding 20 tolas,1 subject to registration in their passports. Ariving female nationals may bring in gold ornaments up 'One tola is equal to 180 grains troy, or 0.4114 ounce. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN up to 25 tolas duty free and up to an additional 75 tolas after paying import duty at a rate of 30 percent. Arriving male nationals may bring in gold ornaments up to 90 tolas, of which 10 tolas are duty free. Changes During 1985 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system 549 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution YUGOSLAVIA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Yugoslavia is the Yugoslav Dinar. The authorities do not maintain the exchange rate of the dinar w i th in announced margins. All transactions, other than those effected under the procedures set forth for certain countries w i th which Yugoslavia has bilateral payments agreements (see section on Prescription of Currency, below), take place at an exchange rate adjusted from time to time by the authorities. The buy ing and selling rates for the U .S. dollar in the foreign exchange market in Belgrade on December 31, 1985 were Din 310.47 and Din 311.41, respectively, per US$1; on the same date, the exchange rate in terms of the U .S. dollar for transactions on bilateral accounts was Din 287.142 per US$1. Rates are also quoted for certain other currencies.! Administration of Control The Federal Assembly formulates the decision on foreign exchange policy of the country for each year; the projections of the balance of payments and the foreign exchange balance of Yugoslavia are component parts of this decision. The Federal Executive Council (FEC) prescribes the general provisions in respect of foreign trade and exchange operations. The Federal Secretariat for Foreign Trade makes decisions governing certain foreign trade transactions and issues import and export licenses and instructions when required. It is also charged with securing balanced trade with payments agreement countries. The Federal Secretariat for Fi- nance, the National Bank of Yugoslavia, and the National Banks of the republics and autonomous prov- inces administer the exchange controls. The National Bank of Yugoslavia prescribes the methods of payment to and from foreign countries. The Yugoslav Community of Interest for Foreign Economic Relations (CIFER), in cooperation w i th the Yugoslav Chamber of the Econ- omy, prescribes uniform criteria on the basis of which enterprises conclude internal self-management agree- ments on the allocation of foreign exchange w i th in the framework of either: (1) one or more of the 22 gen- eral associations within the Yugoslav Chamber of the Economy; or (2) 12 special forms of associations approved by the Yugoslav CIFER (mainly large business conglomerates).2 1 Australian dollars, Austrian sch i l l ings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Iraqi dinars, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Kuwa i ti d inars, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. 2Under a new foreign exchange law, wh ich entered into effect on January 1, 1986, the CIFER was abolished. Access to foreign exchange for most imports in the new system would be determined by an authorized bank on the basis of an enterprise's import and export record; in the case of scheduled debt payments and specified imports, access to foreign exchange would not be restricted; in the case of other imports (i.e., those subject to quota or license), the right to import and to effect the corresponding payment would be determined w i th in the Yugoslav Chamber of the Economy. 550 Foreign exchange transactions must be carried out through an authorized bank, of which there are two types: (1) f u l ly authorized banks, wh ich are permitted to engage in transactions w i th foreign countries and may engage in all foreign exchange transactions in Yugo- slavia and abroad, as well as in foreign credit operations ( inc lud ing the granting of guarantees); (2) banks that are authorized to conduct foreign exchange operations in Yugoslavia only; they may neither keep foreign ex- change accounts abroad nor engage in foreign credit operations, except through banks authorized to engage in foreign exchange transactions abroad. Authorized ex- change offices may only purchase foreign bank notes and traveler's checks; this status is open to all commercial and savings banks. In addition, hotels and tourist agencies, if specifically authorized, may also purchase foreign bank notes and traveler's checks. Commercial exports and imports may be effected by all economic organizations (both producing and trading undertakings) registered for this purpose. Economic organizations that are not registered to conduct foreign trade channel their imports and exports through eco- nomic organizations that are authorized to engage in foreign trade transactions. Resident physical persons may not engage in foreign trade. Prescription of Currency Payments to and from countries w i th wh ich Yugo- slavia has bilateral payments agreements are made in the currencies, and according to the procedures, set forth in those agreements. Yugoslavia has payments agreements requiring denomination of transactions in clearing U .S. dollars w i th A lban ia, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Mongolia, and the U .S .S .R. Nonresident Accounts Foreign juridical and physical persons may maintain accounts denominated in foreign exchange and in dinars in Yugoslavia according to the following rules: for- eigners resident outside Yugoslavia may freely open accounts in convertible currencies with fu l ly authorized banks in Yugoslavia; foreign missions and foreigners resident in Yugoslavia may freely open accounts ex- pressed in foreign currencies with any authorized bank. Foreign exchange accounts in convertible currencies of nonresident jur id ical and physical persons are kept in the currency deposited.3 Balances held in these accounts may be used for all payments in Yugoslavia, in dinars or in the currency concerned, and abroad, in any convert- ible currency. Transfers from these accounts are free if made in the currency in which the account is kept; 3 Accounts may be denominated in any of the fo l low ing currencies: Austrian sch i l l ings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands gu i lders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U .S. dollars. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution outward transfers in other convertible currencies are subject to the bank holding the account being prepared to make the necessary conversion. Nonresident foreign exchange accounts in bilateral currencies may be opened only for certain foreign juridical and physical persons resident in Yugoslavia. Balances may be used only for dinar payments in Yugoslavia or for retransfer to the country to which the bilateral account is related. Foreign juridical and physical persons may in certain cases and under specified conditions open nonresident accounts in dinars w i th authorized banks. Such accounts can be credited freely with amounts whose transfer in convertible currency has been authorized. The possibil- ity of use of dinars from such accounts in Yugoslavia and the degree of transferability of the funds depend on the origin of the dinar deposits. Nonresident juridical and physical persons may also open other dinar accounts w i th authorized banks. These other accounts may be credited with dinars acquired in Yugoslavia in accordance w i th the existing regulations. Balances are, in principle, nontransferable and may be spent in Yugoslavia only for noncommercial payments by the account holder or by members of his immediate fam i ly, or by the owner and staff of foreign firms if the account holder is a foreign juridical person. If balances on these accounts derive from copyright royalties, from work performed in Yugoslavia by foreigners, from pensions, disability allowances, compensations to per- sons decorated with the Order of the National Hero, or from alimony payments, transfers may be effected under specificed conditions. Resident nationals may maintain foreign exchange accounts or foreign exchange savings deposits in con- vertible currencies with any authorized bank. These accounts are kept in the deposited foreign currency and bear interest paid in dinars, or in dinars or foreign exchange for foreign exchange accounts of Yugoslavs temporarily working abroad. Foreign exchange accounts may be retained indefinitely and cash withdrawals from most banks are limited to US$250 a month on the basis of the regulation of the Federal Executive Council. Other payments in Yugoslavia and abroad on behalf of the account holder or members of his immediate fam i ly can be made freely; balances are not transferable to other persons or accounts (see section on Proceeds from Invisibles, below). Yugoslav nationals residing abroad and former emigrants returning to Yugoslavia may also open foreign exchange accounts in Yugoslavia, subject to the same limitations. Imports and Import Payments4 Commercial imports may be effected only by eco- nomic organizations registered as participating in foreign 4Under the system introduced on Janua ry 1, 1986, the r ight to make payments for imports wou ld be determined by the import regime. Importable commodities were classified into four categories: free, conditionally free, subject to quotas, and subject to l icens ing. Wh i le access to foreign exchange for the first, th ird, and four th groups of commodities would be either unrestricted or determined by the Federal Executive Council, the right to import and to effect payments in the case of conditionally free imports would be determined for each enterprise on the basis of previous import and export records. YUGOSLAVIA trade. Most major industrial producers are so registered, in addition to economic organizations that specialize in foreign trade. For import of certain basic foodstuffs, such as hard whea t, rice, butter, and special kinds of edible oil, quotas are fixed by the Federal Executive Council; importation of such goods is carried out either by particular economic organizations or through the Federal Office for Food Reserves, on the basis of public bids. For most commodities, import licenses are not re- quired. All commodities included in the foreign trade nomenclature are classified in three categories: LB — liberalized goods; RK and DK—goods subject to quan- tity or value quotas; D —imports subject to ad hoc licensing. Goods in the LB category are mainly raw materials, foodstuffs, and spare parts, as well as some consumer goods. Protective equipment for workers and all other goods not specifically included in the RK, DK, or D lists are also liberalized and free from any quantitative restriction. Foreign exchange for payments for imports from the convertible currency area is taken out of an enterprise's retained foreign exchange earnings provided on the basis of self-management agreements concluded w i th in the above-mentioned associations in any convert- ible currency appropriate to the exporting country. Pay- ments for imports from payments agreement countries must be made in the manner prescribed in the relevant agreement and may be restricted according to the availability of funds in the appropriate clearing account. Imports under commodity quotas (RK list or DK list) are raw materials, manufacturing components, equip- ment, and consumer goods; limits are established for certain other goods. The quotas are established either in quantities (RK) or in dinars (DK). The allocation among importers of goods subject to quota is decided by agreement among the economic organizations within the Chamber of Economy of Yugos lav ia .5 Additional quotas may be allocated dur ing the year if the enterprise to which the quota is allocated undertakes to increase exports. Goods in list D comprise gunpowder, firearms and ammun i t ion, petroleum, certain types of lubricants, drugs, and natural gas. Import licenses are required only for list D commodities. For certain goods there is an additional requirement of a special import license ("accordance") issued by the Federal Secretariat for Foreign Trade. At the end of 1985 goods subject to this requirement comprised 72 LB items, 11 RK items, and 1 DK item. The items include a wide range of tropical foodstuffs and f ru i ts, raw mate- rials, cocoa butter, fats and oils, raw cotton, textiles, and t in; the Secretariat may also prescribe direct importation from the country of origin. 5In pr inc ip le, any such allocation among importers must be agreed on among economic organizations w i th in the Chamber of Economy according to projections of material balances for each commodity, wh ich are based on the projected growth rates of production. If the importers are unab le to agree among themselves or if the allocation decided upon does not correspond to established principles, the Federal Secretariat for Foreign Trade is authorized to decide on the d is tr ibu t ion. 551 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution YUGOSLAVIA Private persons who are Yugoslav nationals and hold foreign exchange accounts with Yugoslav banks may use these funds freely to import goods for their own use or for the use of close relatives residing with them in accordance with rules governing citizens' right to import and for purchases of domestically produced goods with dinars obtained by selling foreign exchange held in these accounts. Yugoslav nationals who have worked at least two years abroad continuously may import capital equipment necessary for performance of a legally permitted profes- sional activity, provided that such equipment is imported within a three-year period from the date of return, and that the value of each labor instrument is below Din 3.5 million. They may also freely import spare parts for maintenance of capital equipment. In addition, self- employed Yugoslav nationals may import intermediate goods necessary for performance of a legally permitted professional activity, up to the value of Din 500,000 a year; this amount may be increased if the Yugoslav national in question employs other people. Yugoslav nationals may import motor vehicles through consign- ments if payment is made through a foreign exchange account held at a Yugoslav bank; they may also import motor vehicles directly from abroad if they have spent at least two years abroad, provided that they return for permanent residence in Yugoslavia. In addition, they may import motor vehicles inherited abroad, and (up to November 1984) they could import motor vehicles purchased out of an insurance indemnity received for motor vehicles that have been destroyed and had origi- nally been paid for in foreign currency. Imports of motor vehicles are also permissible for those who are military invalids or foreign nationals asking for permanent residence in Yugoslavia. A 1 percent tax for customs evidence and a 7 percent tax equalization charge are payable on all commodities not exempt from customs duty. Many agricultural commodities are subject to variable import levies. Returning resident travelers may bring in duty-free imports up to Din 200 a person. There are special facilities for full or partial exemption for payment of customs duties on certain imports by Yugoslav workers returning from abroad. Payments for Invisibles Foreign exchange to cover expenses abroad for export promotion is made freely available to exporters. Pay- ments for other invisibles in relation to production needs may be made from the remitter's own foreign exchange funds or from the foreign exchange accounts of organiza- tions of associated labor on the basis of self-management agreements at the overall national level and in a small amount within the self-management communities of interest of the republics and autonomous provinces. Purchases of services abroad, as well as spare parts, fue l, etc., by Yugoslav enterprises involved in international freight and passenger transportation are liberalized. 552 There is no exchange allowance for tourist travel abroad. However, Yugoslav citizens are allowed to use balances from their foreign exchange accounts for tourist travel abroad. Under specified conditions, foreign physical persons may effect the following payments abroad: payments for improving labor relationships, pensions, disability al- lowances , and payments to recipients of an Order of the National Hero; alimony payments, payments for court- ordered compensations or indemnities, the profits of foreign contractors performing capital construction work in Yugoslavia; and 10 percent of the proceeds from cultural, entertainment, sport, and other performances given by foreign groups or individuals. In addition, copyright royalties are transferable abroad if such trans- fers are based on reciprocity and if foreign exchange resources have been provided. Payments in respect of royalties and alimony granted by court order are fully transferable, but if a payment is to be made to a country with which Yugoslavia maintains a bilateral payments arrangement, then such payment may be made only if the agreement in question provides for reciprocity. Transfers to convertible currency countries of funds realized by nonresidents from selling property inherited in Yugo- slavia can be effected on the basis of the approval of the Federal Secretariat for Finance under conditions of reciprocity in inheritances and in transfers. Authorized banks may sell foreign currency to resi- dents for payment of specified medical treatment abroad, for remittances for court and other fees abroad, and for specified personal expenses on the basis of approval from the appropriate authorities in the republics and autonomous provinces. Not more than Din 2,500 in domestic currency, in denominations of Din 1,000 or less, may be taken out (or brought in) by travelers on the first trip during the year; and not more than Din 500 a person can be taken out (or brought in) on subsequent trips during the same year. Foreign travelers may bring in and take out any amount in foreign exchange without declaring it. Exports and Export Proceeds Foreign exchange earned through exports of goods and services and other forms of economic cooperation with foreign countries, as well as through purchases on the foreign exchange market, belongs to the particular organizations of associated labor that have taken part in its realization. An organization of associated labor may keep earned foreign exchange in the foreign exchange account, may sell it to an authorized bank, or may use it for its own payments abroad in accordance with the existing regulations. Beginning from the end of 1985, exporters are required to surrender 51 percent of foreign exchange earnings to the National Bank of Yugoslavia and 7 percent of such earnings to the account of the republic or province in which they are situated. If the foreign exchange needs of an exporter, determined within the ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution appropriate association as a percentage of projected exports, is less than 42 percent, the difference is to be sold to the banking system within two days of receipt. Any portion of an exporting f irm's earned foreign exchange which can be retained to satisfy its foreign exchange need but is not used within 15 days is also required to be sold to the banking system.6 In principle, exports are free of control. Certain raw materials that are in short supply in the domestic market (including petroleum and petroleum derivatives, certain livestock, vegetable oils) and certain other materials such as gunpowder, weapons, and narcotic drugs require licenses. Unless specifically exempted, proceeds from exports must be repatriated within 90 days from the date of ex- portation, or within 180 days under specified conditions. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles must be repatriated within 90 days from the date on which the claim is payable. The performance of construction and engineering services is subject to approval ("accordance") by the Federal Com- mittee for Energy and Industry. Exchange proceeds may be used for payments abroad connected with the activi- ties of the economic organization concerned, including payments for purchases of equipment and other material for capital construction work abroad. The exchange proceeds are transferable to Yugoslavia w i th in 30 days from work completion and belong to the economic organizations that have earned them, or they can be sold to authorized banks. With specified exceptions, proceeds from services are subject to the same surrender require- ments and procedures as are proceeds from exports of goods. Residents who, while employed abroad, deposited their savings in foreign savings banks and obtained a "bilingual savings book," issued under specific ar- rangements between Yugoslavia and foreign banks, may withdraw their balances in the form of foreign exchange when in Yugoslavia. Residents may hold interest- bearing foreign currency accounts in Yugoslavia. The accounts may be credited with the fu ll amount of a person's savings in foreign exchange. These accounts may be used for the personal needs of the account holder and of his immediate family; cash withdrawals are limited to US$250 a month and they are not transferable to other persons or accounts and may be retained indefinitely. Not more than Din 2,500 in Yugoslav bank notes, in denominations of Din 1,000 or less, may be brought in by travelers on the first trip during the year, and not more than Din 500 on subsequent trips during the same year. Capital The organizations of associated labor and other social legal persons may borrow abroad in accordance with the YUGOSLAVIA general legislation established by the FEC and the unified criteria established by CIFER. All borrowing is subject to approval by the National Bank. Foreigners may invest in Yugoslav economic organ- izations but only through joint ventures. There is no limit on the share of foreign investment in the organization's capital. Profit transfers are permitted in proportion to the share of the foreign partner's contributions to the income generated on the basis of the resources invested and up to the amount of foreign currency earned by the joint venture from exports of goods and services. If the law governing jo int ventures were to be amended, the legal provisions in force on the date of registration of a joint venture would continue to be applied during the entire life of the investment contract, if the foreign investor so desires, or, at the latter's option, any more favorable provisions of the amended legislation could be applied. Foreign firms are permitted to establish representational offices in Yugoslavia. The investment income earned abroad by Yugoslav economic organizations must be repatriated within 90 days. Residents are obliged to repatriate foreign exchange held or accruing abroad on capital account. Economic organizations wishing to participate in foreign enterprises may be allowed to export the neces- sary capital under special conditions set by federal law; approval for such capital should be obtained from the Federal Secretariat for Foreign Trade, under the proce- dure specified by existing legislation. Enterprises are, in principle, expected to settle exter- nal debt-service obligations on the basis of earned foreign exchange. However, if an enterprise is unable to do so, it is permitted by law to draw progressively on the foreign exchange resources of its associated group of enterprises, on its own bank, on all banks in the republic or province of residence, or on a pool established at the National Bank of Yugoslavia, on the basis of part of the 44.1 percent surrendered by all enterprises.7 Gold In 1968 the National Bank issued certain commemora- tive gold coins, which are legal tender. Foreign travelers are freely permitted to import and export these coins, subject to customs declaration, and for exports, subject to proof that they have been purchased in Yugoslavia. Residents who are private persons may hold gold coin in Yugoslavia but cannot export it except with the approval of the National Bank of Yugoslavia. Such gold coin may be sold to any authorized bank, and residents may freely hold, purchase, and sell gold jewelry and other articles of gold in accordance with the existing regulations on trade in goods and on control of articles made from precious metals. Domestic economic organizations that have been registered as traders in gold may import gold jewelry 6Under the regulations that entered into effect on January 1, 1986, all foreign exchange earnings should be surrendered to the banking system immediately upon repatriation. 7 Under the changes made in the exchange and trade system on January 1, 1986, access to foreign exchange for debt service payments would be given priority over all other payments. 553 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution YUGOSLAVIA under the DK import regime; they may freely export gold jewelry and other articles of gold. Authorized banks may freely export gold coin. Producers may export newly mined gold or sell it to specified users at home at the average price on the international gold market. Domestic sales of newly mined gold by the producers may be made at a price that equals the average quotation in free gold markets abroad. Domestic economic organizations using gold for their normal activities may purchase gold from domestic producers or abroad on the basis of quotas allocated to each such organization individually. Changes During 1985 Administration of Control December 6. As part of a reform of the exchange and trade system, it was decided that with effect from January 1, 1986, the system of allocating foreign exchange by means of consensus within the Yugoslav Community of Interest for Foreign Economic Relations (CIFER) would be replaced by a system in which access to foreign exchange would be directly tied to the right to import. Such rights would be determined by authorized banks or by agreement among economic organizations in the Chamber of the Economy, within global limits set by the Federal Executive Council. In addition, the Federal Executive Council was empowered to impose restric- tions on access to foreign exchange in line with official priority, first to foreign debt service payments, followed by payments for imports made by exporters for their own use and for imports considered to be of general need. Imports and Import Payments September 24. The tax-equalization charge levied on all imports not exempt from customs duty was raised from 6 percent to 7 percent. December 6. Under the exchange reform scheduled to enter into effect on January 1, 1986, commodities were classified into four categories: (a) freely importable items; (b) conditionally free imports; (c) goods import- able under quota; and (d) goods importable under ad hoc licensing. The right to effect import payments in the new regime would be directly linked with the right to import raw materials and intermediate goods. Imports of equip- ment and consumer goods are governed by special rules (with the exception of category LB imports). The extent of payments for each organization of associated labor is calculated on the basis of the actual depreciation allow- ance and a part of realized exports during the preceding year. Access to foreign exchange for payments for imports in the first category would be unrestricted, while it would be guaranteed for those authorized to import items under quota and licenses. For items in the conditionally free category, the right to import and, thus, to effect payment, would be calculated for each enter- prise by an authorized bank on the basis of the enterprise's prior import and export record. The Federal Executive Council could in the course of a given year shift commodities from one category to another, as well as impose other specific restrictions on access to foreign exchange, giving priority in the use of foreign exchange for imports purchased by exporters of materials and parts for their own use and to imports considered to be of general need. Exports and Export Receipts October 18. The share of export proceeds required to be surrendered to the National Bank of Yugoslavia was raised from 44.1 percent to 51 percent, and the propor- tion to be surrendered to republics and provinces was reduced from 10 percent to 7 percent. Accordingly, the share of foreign exchange receipts retained by exporters was reduced from 45.9 percent to 42 percent. December 6. As part of the exchange reform sched- uled to come into effect on January 1, 1986, all foreign exchange earnings from exports were required to be surrendered to the banking system immediately upon repatriation. 554 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ZAIRE (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Zaire is the Zaire. The official exchange rate of the zaire is freely determined in the interbank foreign exchange market, in which the Bank of Zaire (the central bank) participates. A weekly fixing is conducted every Friday, under which the fixing rate is set at a level that allows the largest buying bid to be transacted; bids without limits are effected first, and to the extent possible those for specified amounts could be effected on a split basis. Whatever is the weekly fixing rate, commercial banks are free to negotiate the rates in their daily transactions among themselves, as well as with their clients. On December 31, 1985 the midpoint exchange rate of the zaire in the interbank market was Z 55.79 = US$1. The official exchange rates for the zaire against 20 currencies1 in which authorized banks (and other inter- mediaries) are permitted to deal are published daily by the Bank of Zaire; the rates for the zaire against these currencies, other than the U .S. dollar, are fixed daily by the Bank of Zaire on the basis of the SDR rates for these currencies. Forward exchange transactions are autho- rized under specified conditions. In addition to a com- mission charge of not more than 1 percent, foreign exchange transactions between the authorized commer- cial banks and nonbank customers are subject to an exchange control fee of 3 per mill, payable to the Bank of Zaire. There are no commission charges or exchange fees on foreign exchange transactions in the interbank market. Administration of Control The Bank of Zaire has regulatory authority over all foreign trade and payments, including discretionary power to authorize residents to hold foreign exchange abroad and to use it to pay for certain goods and services. The Public Debt Management Office (OGEDEP), oper- ating under the aegis of the Department of Finance and Budget, manages the medium- and long-term external public and publicly guaranteed debt, is responsible for its servicing, and advises the Executive Council on external debt policy, including terms and guarantees extended by the Government on loans contracted by public, semi- public, and private enterprises. In principle, no new external borrowing may be contracted or guaranteed by the Government without the prior advice of OGEDEP and the Bank of Zaire. Prescription of Currency Payments from nonresidents must be received in the listed convertible currencies quoted daily by the Bank of Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Burundi francs, Canadian dollars, CFA francs, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Kenya shillings, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Rwanda francs, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U .S. dollars. Zaire (see footnote 1). Special authorization for the acceptance of any other currency may be given only in respect of currencies that can be exchanged freely without a discount. Except for working balances, all currencies received must be converted into a convertible currency. Payments to nonresidents must be made in one of the listed convertible currencies; certain settlements with Angola, Burundi, and Rwanda are made through special accounts established under arrangements con- cluded by the Bank of Zaire with the central banks of the countries concerned. Balances on these special accounts are settled on a quarterly basis in convertible currencies. Virtually all settlements (other than for re-exports) with the member countries of the Banque des Etats de TAfrique Centrale (BEAC)2 are effected through the Central African Clearing House (Chambre de Compen- sation de TAfrique Centrale). Nonresident Accounts There are four categories of nonresident accounts: Nonresident Foreign Currency Accounts, Nonresident Convertible Accounts (comptes etrangers convertibles), Nonresident Ordinary Accounts (comptes etrangers or- dinaires), and Nonresident Special Accounts (comptes etrangers indisponibles). All nonresident accounts are noninterest-bearing sight deposits, and no overdraft is permitted. Nonresident Foreign Currency Accounts, as well as nonresident convertible and special accounts, can be opened without the prior authorization of the Bank of Zaire at any authorized commercial bank. With a few exceptions, the opening of nonresident ordinary accounts requires the prior authorization of the Bank of Zaire; such authorization is not required when accounts are opened for embassies and other diplomatic missions (including those representing international and official multinational organizations), official civil and military missions, representative offices in Zaire of foreign transportation companies, and nonresidents entitled to receive payments in zaires for services rendered in Zaire under agreements with or approved by the Executive Council or the Bank of Zaire.

Imports and Import Payments Importation of a number of goods consisting mainly of arms, explosives and ammunition, narcotics, materials contrary to public morals, certain alcoholic beverages, and equipment for aerial and maritime navigation is prohibited (or requires a special authorization from the Executive Council) on grounds of public policy. All other imports are subject only to an import declaration at the authorized banks. Import licenses validated by the authorized banks and import declarations registered by them remain valid for customs clearance for six mon ths, but the va l id i ty may be extended if shipment has begun. Extension of the validity period requires authorization from the Bank of Zaire. Payments for imports may be made either upon arrival or upon shipment ( inc lud ing payments up to 30 days from date of shipment). Payments upon shipment are authorized, provided that the importer obtains a 6 percent rebate on the f .o .b. value. The mode of payment must be indicated on all import declaration forms. Interest payments on foreign financing for im- ports are authorized only if the importer has obtained a supplier's credit or other form of foreign financing with a maturity of at least 90 days, and provided that no advance deposit in foreign currency with the foreign correspondent of the authorized bank involved has been made. A detailed record of all financing charges is required to be submitted by the foreign correspondent to the domestic authorized bank and is used as a basic document to jus t ify any payments of import financing charges. Financing charges are treated as invisible payments associated w i th the import transaction in- volved. Authorized banks are allowed to pay transporta- tion and insurance costs in foreign currency only on imports for which they pay on an f .o .b. basis. In principle, the amount, the invoice price, and the quality of all imports must be verified and found acceptable by the foreign agents of the Office Zairois de Controle (OZAC), but importers are not required to submit to their banks the verification certificates delivered by OZAC (or any of its agents abroad) with respect to preshipment controls for imports payable upon arrival with a value ( f .o .b .) of less than SDR 1,000. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Prior approval of the Bank of Zaire is required for (a) imports transported by foreign air carriers with charges payable in foreign currency, if such costs exceed the f .o .b. value by 20 percent; (b) imports in the form of foreign grants to residents other than the state and subordinate authorities, whenever the value exceeds SDR 1,000; (c) imports with a value in excess of SDR 1,000 in the form of foreign contributions to capital; (d) imports financed with suppliers' credits or other interest-bearing foreign financing with a maturity exceeding one year, other than those contracted or guaranteed by the Government; (e) imports requiring a down payment in foreign currency prior to shipment; and (f) all imports financed with means of payment other than foreign exchange purchased from authorized com- mercial banks in Zaire, proceeds from nonresident accounts held abroad with the authorization of the Bank of Zaire, foreign grants, foreign contributions to capital, and customary short-term foreign trade financing. Prior approval of the Bank of Zaire is not required for (a) imports in the form of foreign grants to the state and subordinate authorities or financed through suppliers' credits or other forms of foreign credit with a maturity of more than one year contracted or guaranteed by the Government; (b) imports for use in the operations of foreign transportation companies represented in Zaire; (c) diplomatic imports; (d) imports in the form of foreign grants in kind with a value of up to SDR 1,000 (up to unlimited amounts for imports in the form of foreign grants to recognized religious, philanthropic, scientific, or cultural organizations); (e) commercial samples with- out market value; (f) imports in the form of foreign contributions to the physical capital of enterprises with a value of up to SDR 1,000; (g) goods for personal use imported into Zaire in connection with relocation; (h) baggage and personal effects of travelers; (i) imports of journals, periodicals, and newspapers for personal use as well as for domestic sale, as permitted by the Executive Council; (j) imports in the form of foreign contributions to capital under the Investment Code or the ZOFI regime; (k) imports of up to SDR 200 transported by Air Zaire with freight payable in foreign currency; (1) emergency imports of spare parts, pharmaceuticals, and precision instruments with a value of up to SDR 1,000; and (m) imports of data processing equip- ment, provided a prior authorization has been granted by SPIZ. Imports effected under bilateral aid arrangements between Zaire and specified countries (Belgium, Canada, the People's Republic of China, the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States) are governed by separate provisions. Payments for Invisibles In principle, all payments for invisibles are subject to authorization by the Bank of Zaire. The Bank of Zaire will not authorize the payment in foreign exchange of commissions in favor of shippers or purchasing agents. Imports and exports between Zaire and ports in Belgium, ZAIRE the Federal Republic of Germany, the Netherlands, and the Scandinavian countries must be shipped in vessels participating in the conference of the Associated Central West Africa Lines. Beginning from December 26, 1985 Zairian freight is reserved exclusively to bonded ship- owners whose freight charges have been authorized in advance by the Office Zairois de Gestion des Frets Maritimes. Banks are not authorized to pay in foreign currency the maritime freight on shipments that do not meet these regulations, unless an immediate discount is obtained on the invoice. Banks may effect maritime freight payments in foreign currency at the time of shipment only for imports payable upon shipment; they may also effect maritime freight payments in foreign currency at the time of shipment for imports payable upon arrival, provided that the payment is made directly to the carrier. Maritime freight charges may be paid in Zaire in local currency when goods are transported entirely by the Compagnie Maritime Zairoise. Other payments relating to services performed by nonresidents are, in principle, permitted. However, outward remittances of salaries of expatriate employees during the year are limited to the levels authorized during 1981; the transfer abroad of salaries of newly hired expatriates is limited to 50 percent of net salary, provided that the nontransferable amount is sufficient to meet local needs. Transfers pertaining to certain admini- strative expenses that firms incur abroad, interest on private loans, and payment of certain portions of insurance premiums are generally permitted. Transfers of net profits of firms with foreign participation are authorized. Transfers of nonresidents' rental income are suspended. Payments for commissions, brokerage charges and miscellaneous fees, and royalties may be authorized in some cases. Tickets for travel abroad may be purchased in Zaire for trips starting in Zaire. Zairian nationals traveling abroad may buy foreign exchange in amounts that depend on the duration of the journey and the status of the traveler. Residents in Zaire are allowed to purchase foreign exchange at the authorized commercial banks to cover the following expenditures: travel expenses, med- ical expenses, and students' tuition and living costs, as well as training expenses incurred abroad. For trips to Burundi and Rwanda tourists and households residing in the border area are entitled once a month to purchase the equivalent of SDR 100 in Burundi or Rwanda francs. The import (or export) of Zairian notes and coins as well as of other Zairian means of payment by both residents and nonresidents is prohibited. However, the import of such means of payment by travelers from Burundi and Rwanda is authorized within the limits of the agreements between the members of the Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports not covered by general declarations re- quire individual declarations. Banks are normally autho- rized to approve such declarations. The declaration must 557 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ZAIRE specify the nature of the merchandise to be exported, the price, and the currency in which payment is to be received. Declarations of foreign exchange commitment are normally valid for 90 days; within this period, the proceeds must be received and surrendered. Coffee may be exported only by recognized coffee exporters; such exports are subject to quality control. Special provisions apply to mineral production of the Generate des Car- rieres et de Mines du Zaire (GECAMINES), which is authorized to retain 45 percent of its export proceeds with banks abroad or in Zaire for meeting its own payments abroad and must surrender the remainder to the Bank of Zaire. Partial nonrepatriation and retention abroad are also permitted for a limited number of other enterprises, including the Societe de Developpement Industriel et Minier du Zaire (SooiMlZA—75 percent) and the Societe Miniere de Bakwanga (MiBA—20 percent), while full retention of export receipts in accounts abroad are permitted in some other cases, notably the oil corpora- tions. The trade of artisanal gold and diamonds is in principle free, with exports being channeled through authorized marketing agencies (comptoirs agrees). In- dustrial diamonds are sold through the De Beers Group. Minimum export prices have been established for coffee, cocoa, tea, ivory, papain, rauwolfia, and cinchona. The export of Zairian notes and coin as well as other Zairian means of payment is prohibited. Proceeds from Invisibles Authorized banks may retain all their foreign ex- change receipts from invisibles on the same basis as their export receipts. Travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes or other means of payment denominated in foreign currency, provided they declare them to immi- gration upon entry. No declaration of means of payment denominated in foreign currency is required upon departure. Capital The repatriation of foreign capital brought in under the provisions of the Investment Code is guaranteed, as is the transfer of profits and dividends on such capital. With minor exceptions, other transfers abroad of capital owned by residents or nonresidents are not authorized. The net foreign currency asset position of authorized banks is not permitted to exceed 40 percent of their own resources. Gold Only Zairian nationals are allowed to purchase, transport, sell, or hold gold within Zaire, outside the boundaries of areas covered by exclusive mining conces- sions. Foreign individuals or corporate persons and corporate persons under Zairian law may do so only on behalf of and for account of authorized marketing agencies. With the exception of jewelry, imports and exports of gold require prior authorization from the Bank of Zaire. Gold produced by mining companies is purchased by the Bank of Zaire under agreed terms. The Bank of Zaire may authorize part of the gold produced by these companies to be sold to residents for their industrial activities. There is free trade in domestic gold mined by small-scale producers. Changes During 1985 Imports and Import Payments March 7. A new national trading corporation, SONATRAD, was established to improve purchasing terms and procedures for inputs and materials imported by the five major public enterprises. April 20. Import duties were increased as follows: alcoholic beverages, 33!/2 percent; tobacco, 10 percent; sugar, flour, and cereal, 3-8 percent. June 5. The importation of petroleum products was liberalized, so that oil companies other than Petrozaire could compete with the latter for the importation and marketing of petroleum products. In addition, new companies would be allowed to enter the market for petroleum products under specified conditions. June 21. The obligatory prior deposit in connection with the opening of uncovered letters of credit was eliminated. (The requirement had been lowered from 50 percent to 25 percent in March 1985.) Capital July 1. The definition of "own resources" for the computation of the limit on the net foreign asset position of authorized banks was modified, and the limit on such assets as a proportion of "own resources" was lowered from 75 percent to 40 percent. 558 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ZAMBIA (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Zambia is the Zambian Kwacha, for which the intervention currency is the U .S. dollar. The exchange rate of the kwacha is determined at a weekly auction which takes into account the private sector's demand for foreign exchange in relation to the available supply. The payments of the Government and of speci- fied public sector entities, as well as allocations to commercial banks as working balances, are made out of administrative allocations. All other transactions are channeled through the auction market. The Bank of Zambia deals with the Government and with authorized banks in U.S. dollars and pounds sterling. Authorized banks are free to deal in other currencies at rates based on daily rates provided by the Bank of Zambia, or on the basis of cross rates with the U.S. dollar prevailing in international foreign exchange markets. In its dealings with the commercial banks the Bank of Zambia applies a margin of 0.25 percent for purchases and sales of foreign exchange. On December 31, 1985 the Bank of Zambia's buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were K 5.6715 = US$1 and K 5.7855 = US$1, respectively. Authorized banks are permitted to charge an additional 1 percent on either side for transactions by telegraphic transfers, and 1.25 percent for sales and purchases and transfers and foreign currency notes, when quoting their rates to customers. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Bank of Zambia under powers delegated to it by the Minister of Finance. The control of trade is the responsibility of the Ministry of Commerce, which also issues import and export licenses. Overall import policy is determined by the Ministerial Committee on Foreign Exchange. Prescription of Currency Authorized payments, including payments for im- ports, by residents of Zambia to residents of other countries may be made in any foreign currency. Pay- ments from residents of other countries may be received in sterling or in Zambian currency from an External Account, or in any foreign currency freely exchangeable for U .S. dollars or pounds sterling. Nonresident Accounts Accounts in Zambian currency held with authorized banks by residents of other countries are designated Non- resident Accounts.' These accounts may be credited with authorized payments from residents of Zambia, with transfers from other Nonresident Accounts, and with the proceeds from sales of any foreign currency by nonresi- 1 Authorized banks are required to obtain prior permission of the exchange control authorities before designating any new External Account, except when the account is to be opened for a temporary visitor. dents to authorized banks. They may be debited for payments for any purpose to residents of Zambia, for transfers to other Nonresident Accounts, and for pur- chases of any foreign currency from dealers with prior exchange control permission. Blocked Accounts in Zambian currency held with authorized dealers in foreign exchange by residents of any country other than Zambia are credited with non- transferable capital sums in Zambian currency. All debits and credits to such accounts require the prior approval of the exchange control authorities, except that the accounts of emigrants may be debited each year for the permitted anniversary allowance for a remittance to the country of residence of the account holder. Normally, approval is given for the investment of balances on Blocked Accounts in Zambian securities, provided that these are held in Zambia to the order of an authorized dealer. The interest on Blocked Account balances is freely transferable to the account holder's country of residence. Imports and Import Payments The import from all countries of certain specified commodities is prohibited for reasons of health, safety, or public policy. Personal and household effects, sam- ples , diplomatic shipments, and means of transportation entering Zambia temporarily do not require individual import licenses, nor do any other goods for personal use and consumption, provided that the person importing them does not import more than K 50 worth of such goods in any period of 90 days. However, no payment may be made for goods not licensed, even where the value is less than K 50. The Controller of Customs is authorized to admit emergency goods imported without prior reference to the Ministry of Commerce. All other imports require individual import licenses. Import licenses are issued without restriction, and are not used for purposes of industrial protection; fees amounting to 5 percent of the value of the imports are levied in this connection. Importers must obtain foreign exchange through bidding at the auction before letters of credit can be opened by the commercial banks, and all financial arrangements between importers and foreign suppliers for the supply of goods on credit must be approved by the Bank of Zambia. Importers intending to import goods not involving use of official foreign exchange must obtain the prior approval of the Bank of Zambia before applying to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry for a "no funds" import license. Import licenses issued by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry must be obtained by importers before proceeding to the Bank of Zambia for approval and, subsequently, to the commercial banks for the issuance of letters of credit. The commercial banks are required to submit to the Bank of Zambia a weekly return on letters of credit opened, giving specified information. 559 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ZAMBIA Most imported goods are subject to a sales tax of 15 percent of taxable value, which is calculated as the sum of (1) 120 percent of the customs value, and (2) the applicable customs du ty. Certain import payments are in arrears; these arrears have been centralized, and the Bank of Zambia is settling them in accordance with certain priorities. Payments for Invisibles Payments in foreign exchange for freight and other charges on imports require the prior approval of the Bank of Zambia. The basic allowance for business travel is US$135 a person a day for up to 12 days a calendar year; foreign exchange for this purpose must have the prior ap- proval of the exchange control authorities. Allowance for business travel for the purpose of export promotion is permissible up to the equivalent of K 6,000 a company a year. Remittance abroad of part or all of payments for advertising, management, accounting, administrative, engineering, and consulting services rendered to resi- dents by nonresidents are issued by using foreign exchange obtained through the auction. Profits and dividends declared after October 31, 1985 of subsidiaries and branches of companies whose head offices are situated outside Zambia may be transferred abroad up to 15 percent of the nonresident share of the equity capital, or 50 percent of net profits accruing to the nonresident owners of incorporated companies, whichever is smaller, with foreign exchange obtained through the auction. Expatriate farmers are permitted to remit 12.5 percent of their after-tax profits including profits earned from a partnership or private limited company engaged in farming. A further 10 percent may be held to their credit every year for eventual remittance when they leave Zambia. Such remittances are allowed once a year after the end of the accounting year. The remittance of depreciation allowances is not permitted. Any airline not landing and picking up passengers in Zambia is not allowed to remit funds abroad, except for those funds already accumulated in Zambia. Foreign nationals employed in Zambia on a contract made after December 4, 1971 are allowed to remit one third of their annual earnings (subject to a maximum of K 10,000) to the country nominated when the contract was registered with the exchange control authorities. Following the introduction of the auction for foreign exchange, remittances may be used at the exchange rate prevailing immediately prior to the introduction of the auction on October 3, 1985.2 Foreign nationals availing 2On January 1, 1986 this institutional arrangement was abolished. From that date expatriates could remit up to US$6,600 per year in monthly installments as an "inducement allowance." In addition, they could remit an end-of-contract gratuity of up to 25 percent of the cumulative inducement allowances. The payments of expatriates employed by the Government and the ZCCM (the m in ing company) would be made from their own allocations of foreign exchange, wh i le all other payments would be made from the working balance of commercial banks. Contracts concluded between October 4, 1985 and December 31, 1985 were also required to conform to these require- ments, except that outward remittances of inducement allowances through December 31, 1985 were settled at the exchange rate prevailing on October 3, 1985. 560 themselves of these arrangements are not entitled to the regular allowances for travel, education, maintenance, etc.; their leave salary, gra tu i ty, and other terminal benefits are transferable only on completion of the contract period. Travelers leaving Zambia may take out a max imum of K 10 in Zambian currency. Certain current payments for invisibles are in arrears. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports valued at over K 50 require a license, except those covered by an open general license; minerals are exported under general agreements w i th the mining companies. The export of certain metals is reserved, in principle, for an official agency, the Metal Marketing Corporation. Certain commodities are subject to licensing mainly to ensure domestic supplies of needed goods and of certain strategic materials, such as implements of war, lead in any form, certain minerals, petroleum products, certain rough and uncut precious stones, scrap and old metals, and ju te bags. For most goods, however, export licenses are issued freely. Export proceeds in foreign currency appropriate to the country of destination must be offered for sale to an authorized bank within six months of the date of shipment; the Zambian Corporation for Copper Mining may retain up to 35 percent of its export proceeds to meet its own needs, but the balance must be credited to a Bank of Zambia account in London upon receipt. All exports must be financed through irrevocable letters of credit and be registered with the Bank of Zambia. As an incentive, up to 50 percent of nontraditional export proceeds is allowed to be retained for a specified time period by the exporter on application to the Bank of Zambia. Unless evidence of conversion of at least an equivalent amount in exchange can be provided, hotel bills payable by nonresidents must be settled in foreign exchange. Nonnational agricultural producers are eligible for certain incentives in the form of foreign exchange, on the basis of every standard bag of maize, wheat, soybean, or tobacco sold by them in excess of the prescribed number of bags. Corresponding foreign exchange incentives for national agricultural producers are made available on application to the exchange control authorities. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in any currency must be offered for sale to an authorized bank. There is no limitation on the amount of foreign currency notes that may be imported by travelers, except that travelers from Zaire are allowed to import only up to the equivalent of K 20. Travelers arriving in Zambia may bring in a maximum of K 10 in Zambian currency. Capital Inward transfers of capital are not restricted, but with the exception of overseas short-term f inanc ing of imports other than certain capital goods, all borrowing outside Zambia requires the approval of the exchange control authorities. Outward transfers of capital are controlled, but nonresidents are normally permitted to repatriate ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution their investments when they have satisfied the authori- ties that the original investment was made with funds brought into the country from sources outside Zambia. The repatriation is generally spread over a period longer than three years. Local borrowing by companies con- trolled either directly or indirectly from outside Zambia is restricted to a debt-equity ratio of 1 to 3. However, the Bank of Zambia permits borrowings in excess of this limit for certain priority sectors of the economy, pro- vided that the borrowings secure higher employment opportunities or savings of foreign exchange. In general, residents are not permitted to transfer capital abroad and, with certain exceptions, are required to offer for sale to an authorized bank any foreign exchange which accrues to them. As a special measure, however, residents may purchase Zambian securities quoted on recognized stock exchanges abroad, provided that the securities so acquired are registered in the names of specified nominees and that, in the event of subse- quent disposal of these securities, the sales proceeds will be repatriated. All income earned from these investments must be repatriated. Emigrants are granted foreign exchange as follows: (1) settling-in allowance of K 6,000 for single persons, K 8,000 for married persons, K 12,000 for persons aged 50 years and over, and K 500 per child up to a maxi- mum of 4 children; and (2) anniversary allowance of K 3,000 for single persons, K 6,000 for married persons, and K 7,500 for persons aged 50 years and above. In addition, there are special facilities for expatriate farmers for the transfer of profits up to certain limits (see section on Payments for Invisibles, above). Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Zambia for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require exchange control approval as well as import or export licenses issued by the Minister of Commerce; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. Gold-bearing sludge is exported by copper companies for refining and sale abroad. Foreign exchange for imports of gold may be provided with the permission of the Bank of Zambia. ZAMBIA system was suspended, pending the introduction of a new (auction) system. October 4. The exchange rate of the kwacha began to be determined through weekly auctions conducted by the Bank of Zambia. The exchange rate in each auction would be determined by the marginal market-clearing bid. The following transactions would be effected using foreign exchange allocations outside of the auction system: direct transactions of the Government, the governing party, and of the Bank of Zambia, the mining company's export earnings retention quota; crude oil imports and related port charges; working balances for commercial banks; payments by Zambia Airways to the International Air Transport Association; debt service payments; medical and educational supplies; and letters of credit opened prior to October 4, 1985. All other transactions would be channeled through the auction. Imports and Import Payments January 16. A requirement was introduced that air freight charges on "no funds involved" (i.e., own- financed) imports by air cargo should be paid in foreign currency. March 27. Separate import licenses were introduced for imports from within the Preferential Trade Area of Eastern and Southern Africa. October 4. As part of the exchange reform, it was announced that import licenses would be issued without restriction and not used for protective purposes; licenses accompanying unsuccessful bids could be reused at subsequent auctions. Payments for Invisibles October 4. As part of the exchange reform, it was decided that expatriate remittances would be paid at the pre-auction rate as a transitional measure between October 4, and December 31, 1985, and that from January 1, 1986 maximum expatriate remittances would be expressed in U .S. dollars. (On January 1, 1986, existing regulations on allowances were replaced with a new system comprising an inducement allowance pay- able monthly within a limit of US$6,600 a person a year, and an end-of-contract gratuity (in U .S. dollars) up to 25 percent of the cumulative inducement allowance.) October 7. It was announced that the basic allowances for business and holiday travel would be denominated in U .S. dollars. Changes During 1985 Exchange Arrangement October 1.

A "no questions asked" system was instituted for foreign currency transfers into Zambia. 561 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ZIMBABWE (Position on December 31, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Zimbabwe is the Zimbabwe Dollar. The exchange rate of the Zimbabwe dollar is determined on the basis of a fixed relationship to a trade-weighted basket of currencies. The U .S. dollar is the intervention currency. The spread applied by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe between the buy ing and selling rates is 0.8 percent for major currencies and 1.0 percent for other currencies. An additional 0.25 percent on either side of the quoted rates of major currencies may be charged by authorized dealers (authorized commercial and merchant banks). The authorized dealers base their rates for other currencies on current international market rates. Forward exchange contracts are permitted only for trade transactions. There is no limit on the amount of such contracts, but these must be limited to periods of three to six months. The Reserve Bank is prepared to cover forward transactions and, at present, quotes fixed discount or premium rates for major currencies. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Reserve Bank, under powers delegated to it by the Minister of Finance, Economic Planning and Development, in terms of the Exchange Control Act, Chapter 170, and the Exchange Control Regulations of 1977. Authorized dealers have been empowered to approve certain foreign exchange transactions in accordance w i th Exchange Control Instructions Issued to Authorized Dealers (July 1, 1981, as amended) and Exchange Control Circulars issued periodically. Import and export controls are administered in accordance with the Control of Goods (Import and Export) (Agriculture) Regulations of 1965, as amended, the Control of Goods (Import and Export) (Commerce) Regulations of 1974, as amended, the Control of Goods (Export of Minerals and Metals) Order, 1979, the Control of Goods (Open General Import License) Notice of 1979, and the Control of Goods (Open General Export License) Notice, 1977. Prescription of Currency All payments by nonresidents to residents must be effected in denominated currencies,1 with the exception of payments otherwise specified or effected through nonresident accounts. Under the Clearing House Ar- rangement, which went into effect on February 1, 1984, within the Preferential Trade Area for Eastern and Southern African States (PTA), member countries can use national currencies in the settlement of payments 'There are 17 denominated currencies which are freely convertible through authorized dealers: Austrian sch i l l ings, Belgian francs, Cana- dian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, I ta l ian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, South African rand, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U .S. dollars. 562 during a transaction period of two calendar months; net balances at the end of this period require settlement in convertible currencies. Nonresident Accounts Nonresident accounts may be opened with the ap- proval of the exchange control authorities by persons who have never been residents of Zimbabwe. Nonresi- dent accounts may be credited with foreign currencies, with payments from other nonresident accounts, or with payments by residents that would be eligible for transfer outside Zimbabwe. Nonresident accounts may be deb- ited for payments to residents, for payments to other nonresident accounts, or for payments abroad. Only former residents now residing outside of Zimbabwe may maintain emigrants' accounts in Zimbabwe. Cash assets held in Zimbabwe in the names of emigrants must be blocked in these accounts, and all payments to and from these accounts are strictly subject to various exchange restrictions. Imports and Import Payments With the exception of products covered by the Open General Import License (OGIL), all imports are subject to licensing requirements. (At present the OGIL covers very few items.) Import licenses are issued only against a certificate of foreign exchange allocation. Global foreign exchange allocations are decided by an Interministerial Committee, chaired by the Ministry of Finance, Eco- nomic Planning and Development, and are made avail- able through the Ministry of Trade and Commerce and the Ministry of Industry and Technology. The Ministry of Trade and Commerce basically handles allocations for goods in the commercial category, while those in the industrial category are handled by the Ministry of Industry and Technology. Imports in the commercial category include imports by merchants of raw materials, machinery, and spare parts for resale to manufacturers and the public sector, as well as consumer goods; those in the industrial category consist of direct importation by industrialists of raw materials, machinery, and spare parts. For purposes of allocating commercial imports, individual products are classified into five categories in accordance with the degree of essentiality. (In the manufacturing sector, because of employment con- siderations, similar priority ratings are not so strictly applied.) Foreign exchange is allocated to individual commercial importers for single tariff items (with facili- ties for a limited degree of transferability between items), whereas foreign exchange allocated to manufac- turers is for a group of tariff items appropriate to the industrial division concerned. Manufacturers receive through the Ministry of Industry and Technology sepa- rate allocations for raw materials required for production for the local and export markets; the former is assessed ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution on the basis of priority and foreign exchange availability, while the latter is in the form of initial allocations based on past performance, with possible additional allocation from an export revolving fund against proof of exports. Import licenses have to be drawn against foreign exchange allocation certificates at the time orders are placed. The normal validity of import licenses is six months from the end of the month of issue, but the validity period can be extended in certain circumstances. Import licenses are normally issued without geographical restriction and importers are free to choose the country of supply. Licenses are issued on an f .o .b. basis and do not, therefore, cover the invisibles element of the transactions. Imports of certain goods (mostly agricultural and processed food products) require a special permit issued by the Ministry of Agriculture. Certain agricultural products (coffee, maize, sorghum, soybeans, and wheat) may be imported only by the Grain Marketing and Cotton Marketing Boards or by others with the permis- sion of the Boards. No quotas are in force, but seasonal restrictions are applied in the case of certain agricultural products. Authorized dealers may approve applications to effect payments for authorized imports, provided necessary documentation (including the details of import licenses or open general licenses) is submitted. Payments for imports into Zimbabwe from all countries may be made in Zimbabwean currency to a local nonresident account or in any foreign currency. The customs duty regime consists mainly of ad valorem duties, which range up to 40 percent, and speci- fic duties on a number of products. Generally, imports are subject to an additional tax of 15 percent or 20 percent, which is the countervailing levy to the sales tax imposed at the same rates on goods sold domes- tically. Most imports are subject to a surtax of 20 percent. Payments for Invisibles Foreign exchange to pay for invisibles related to imports and, within certain limits, for other purposes is provided by commercial banks under delegated author- ity. Applications for foreign exchange exceeding the limit established for commercial banks are approved by the Reserve Bank, which deals with each case on its merits. The basic foreign exchange allowance for holiday travel is Z$60 a day up to a maximum of Z$450 for a 12-month period. The allowance may be accumulated up to three years but it is not granted in advance. (Children under ten are entitled to one half of these amounts.) A fee of 20 percent is applied on sales of foreign exchange for purposes of holiday travel. The basic foreign ex- change allowance for import-related business travel is Z$ 100 a day up to a maximum of Z$ 1,500 a trip, with an overall annual maximum of Z$3,000; for export-related business travel, the exchange allowance is Z$125 a day ZIMBABWE for a maximum of Z$2,000 a trip and an annual limit of Z$4,000. Applications for business travel allowance exceeding the specified limits are subject to the approval of the Reserve Bank. Foreign exchange is provided for education abroad beyond the secondary school level, within the following limits: Z$4,000 a year for education at universities other than those in the United States and the United Kingdom, and Z$l0,000 a year for education at specified universities in the United States and the United Kingdom. For medical treatment, foreign ex- change is provided up to Z$20 a day for a maximum period of 30 days for the patient and any necessary accompanying companion. Remittances of up to Z$40 for subscriptions to religious and educational societies, and Z$20 for other societies are allowed; the limit for an initial membership fee is Z$50. Remittances to close relatives permanently resident outside Zimbabwe, not exceeding Z$30 a month for each individual beneficiary and Z$60 a month for each family unit, are permitted with the approval of the Reserve Bank. Outward remit- tances in respect of fees for technical, administrative, management, and consultancy services or to defray external expenses of local branches are subject to a tax of 20 percent. Previously blocked funds, whether already converted into government bonds or not, can qualify as new venture capital if, when matched by an inflow of investment funds from abroad on a 50-50 or similar basis, they are reinvested in Zimbabwe in an approved project. As new venture capital, the total investment will be eligible for remittable dividends for up to 50 percent of after-tax profits. However, the "blocked" portion of the new investment, unlike new venture capital, must remain reinvested in Zimbabwe for a minimum of seven to ten years, depending on individual cases. With effect from January 1, 1986, suspended remit- tances of profits and dividends declared from March 27, 1984 through December 31, 1985 and maintained in the "suspended accounts" with commercial banks can be released by means of six-year 4 percent government bonds; with effect from the same date, remittances of profits and dividends are governed by the applicable regulations that were in effect prior to March 1984, involving a limit of 50 percent on the rate of profit after tax. Outward transfers of interest earnings are subject to a tax of 10 percent. Applications for emigrant status must be submitted to the Reserve Bank. Beginning from March 27, 1984, the settling-in allowance that can be remitted abroad by emigrants is limited to Z$ 1,000 per family unit. In exceptional and deserving cases, the exchange control authorities will consider applications exceeding this maximum. Before these changes, transferable allow- ances at the time of emigration were as follows: (1) single persons under the age of 40 years, Z$500; (2) single persons aged 40-59 years, Z$l ,000; (3) family units and single persons with dependents (under 60 years of age), Z$ 1,000; (4) family units (husband over 60 years of age) and single persons over 60, Z$7,000; 563 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ZIMBABWE (5) persons over 80 years of age, Z$l0,000; (6) widows (no age restriction), Z$l0,000; and (7) handicapped or disabled persons, Z$l0,000. A further release of capital is made as an annual allowance on the anniversary date of the emigrant's departure, as follows: persons over 65 years of age, Z$2,000, and persons over 70 years of age, Z$3,000. Beginning from April 1, 1984, all those applying for emigrant status are required to take steps to liquidate their assets within a period of six months and to invest the total proceeds, less any settling-in allowance granted, in Government of Zimbabwe external bonds. In exceptional cases of emigrants unable to comply with the six-month limit, the matter may be referred to the Reserve Bank. A traveler leaving Zimbabwe may take out, as part of the travel allowance, not more than Z$20 in Zimbab- wean currency together with a maximum of the equiva- lent of Z$20 in foreign bank notes. Nonresident travelers may take out traveler's checks they imported less the amount sold to authorized dealers. Upon departure from Zimbabwe, nonresident travelers may reconvert unspent Zimbabwean currency into foreign currencies against presentation of exchange certificates. Exports and Export Proceeds Licenses are required to export certain products that are not covered by the OGIL; these include (1) any ore, concentrate, or other manufactured product of chrome, copper, lithium, nickel, t in, or tungsten; (2) petroleum products; (3) jute and hessian bags; (4) road or rail tankers for carrying liquids or semiliquids; (5) bitumen, asphalt, and tar; (6) wild animals and wild animal products; (7) certain wood products; (8) ammonium nitrate; and (9) implements of war. In addition to security and social reasons, export licensing require- ments are intended to ensure adequate domestic supply of essential products. Goods may not be exported without permission, unless the customs authorities are satisfied that payment has been made in an approved manner or will be so made within three months from the date of shipment or such longer period as may be permitted by the Reserve Bank. Payments for exports must be received w i th in 90 days in the following manner: (1) in a denominated currency; (2) in Zimbabwean currency from a nonresident account; and (3) in the case of Malawi and Botswana, by checks drawn in Malawi kwacha or Botswana pula, respec- tively. Under the PTA arrangement (see Prescription of Currency, above) member countries can use national currencies in the settlement of payments during a transaction period of two months, with net balances at the end of this period to be settled in convertible currencies. Exports to some 50 countries are approved only upon advance payment of export proceeds or if payment is covered by an irrevocable letter of credit issued or confirmed prior to export by a reputable 564 overseas bank. Export receipts must be sold to autho- rized dealers. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles are required to be sold to authorized banks within a reasonable period of time. Residents performing professional services abroad are not permitted to retain any part of their foreign exchange earnings, and such earnings are required to be sold to an authorized bank. Foreign currency and traveler's checks may be imported without restrictions but must be sold or exchanged in Zimbabwe only through authorized deal- ers. A traveler may bring in Zimbabwean currency up to a maximum of Z$20. Capital Inward transfers of capital through normal banking channels are not restricted. Outward transfers of capital are controlled, but all foreign investments, irrespective of their source, that are undertaken through normal banking channels since Sep- tember 1, 1979 may be considered for repatriation after two years, subject to the requirement that the amount to be repatriated will be reduced by any profits remitted in the interim. Where such authority is granted, the balance may be transferred only through the established medium of external government bonds bearing interest at the rate of 4 percent a year. The repatriation of capital invested before Septem- ber 1, 1979 is prohibited; however, shareholders are allowed within limits to apply to the Reserve Bank for the remittance of such capital upon the sale of shares to local residents, and if such application is approved, the capital is invested in external government bonds bearing interest at the rate of 4 percent a year. Beginning from March 27, 1984, former residents holding blocked assets, and new emigrants, are allowed to invest their funds in Government of Zimbabwe external bonds with a maturity of 12 years and an annual interest rate of 4 percent. The remittability of the Zimbabwean pension of a former resident is guaranteed under the Constitution. All other outward transfers of capital are subject to approval by the Reserve Bank, as are dealings in external securities. Gold The export of gold in unmanufactured form is con- trolled and licensed under the Control of Goods (Export of Minerals and Metals) Order, 1979. The administra- tion of the Order is the responsibility of the Minis- try of Mines. No person may export any precious metal and certain other specified metals and minerals unless he holds an export license; no such licenses for gold are issued. These controls do not, however, apply to the Reserve Bank. The import of gold is controlled by the Gold Trade Act. The Act provides for certain ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution requirements to be met when a person intends to import gold into Zimbabwe. No person, either as principal or agent, is entitled to deal in or possess gold unless (1) he is the holder of a license or permit; or (2) he is the holder or distributor of a registered mining location from which gold is being produced; or (3) he is the employee or agent of any of the persons mentioned in (1) and (2) above, and is autho- rized by his employer or principal to deal in or possess gold in the lawful possession of such employer or prin- cipal. A mining commissioner may issue to any person a permit authorizing him to acquire or to be in possession of or to dispose of any gold, provided the quantity does not exceed one troy ounce. In all other cases, permission can only be issued by the Secretary for Mines. Three types of licenses may be issued under the terms of the Gold Trade Act: a gold dealing license, a gold recovery works license, and a gold assaying license. Barclays Bank International Ltd. is the only authorized dealer under the terms of the Act, and each holder or distributor of a registered mining location is required to lodge with this bank all gold acquired by him in the course of his operations by the tenth day of the month following that in which the gold was produced. When a person intends to smelt any gold or any article containing gold, he must first obtain a license issued by a district commissioner under the terms of the Second Hand Goods Act autho- rizing him to be in possession of smelting equipment. Changes During 1985 Imports and Import Payments August 15. The "local content" requirement on im- ports of textiles from Botswana was reduced from 25 percent to 20 percent. ZIMBABWE Payments for Invisibles April 1. The Exchange Control Department an- nounced that previously blocked funds, whether already converted into government bonds or not, could qua l ify as new venture capital if, when matched by an inflow of investment funds from abroad (on a 50—50 or similar basis), they were reinvested in Zimbabwe in an approved project. As new venture capital, the total investment would be eligible for remittable dividends for up to 50 percent of after-tax profits. However, the "blocked" portion of the new investment, unlike new venture capital, should remain reinvested in Zimbabwe for a minimum of seven to ten years, depending on individual cases. May 21. The Minister of Finance announced that suspended remittances of profits and dividends declared from March 27, 1984 through December 31, 1985 and maintained in the "suspended accounts" with commer- cial banks would be released starting January 1, 1986 by means of six-year 4 percent government bonds. In addition, the pre-March 1984 regulation on remittances of profits and dividends on the basis of a maximum of 50 percent after-tax profits would be reinstated with effect from January 1, 1986. August 5. The annual limit on the basic foreign exchange allowance for tourist travel was increased from Z$360 to Z$450 a person. October 7. The annual foreign exchange allowance for post-secondary education abroad was increased from Z$750 to Z$4,000 a student in universities other than those in the United States and the United Kingdom, and from Z$6,000 to Z$l0,000 for a university student in the latter two countries. 565 ©International Monetary Fund.
