Not for Redistribution Preface The Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions has been published by the IMF since 1950. It draws on information available to the IMF from a number of sources, includ- ing that provided in the course of official staff visits to member countries, and has been prepared in close consultation with national authorities. The information is presented in a tabular format. This project was coordinated in the Monetary and Capital Markets Department by a staff team directed by Karl F. Habermeier and comprising Harald Jens Anderson, Annamaria Kokeny, Maria Zenaida M. de Mesa, Judit Vadasz, Romain Veyrune, and Jahanara Zaman. It draws on the special- ized contribution of that department (for specific countries), with assistance from staff members of the IMF’s five area departments, together with staff of other departments. The report was edited by Linda Griffin Kean of the External Relations Department (EXR) and produced by Mrs. de Mesa, Alicia Etchebarne-Bourdin of EXR, and the IMF Multimedia Services Division. Lucy Scott Morales provided editorial assistance. vii ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution This page intentionally left blank ©International Monetary Fund.

Not for Redistribution Introduction This volume (the 59th edition) of the Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER) provides a description of the foreign exchange arrangements, exchange and trade restrictions, capital controls, and relevant prudential measures of all IMF member countries.1 Publication of the AREAER fulfills Article XIV, Section 3, of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, which mandates annual reports on the restrictions in force under Article XIV, Section 2. The AREAER also contributes to implementing Paragraph 16 of the 2007 Surveillance Decision, which restates the obligation under the IMF’s Articles of Agreement for each member country to notify the IMF of the exchange arrangement it intends to apply and any changes in the arrangement. The 2008 edition, like previous editions, attempts to provide a comprehensive description of exchange and trade systems, going beyond exchange restrictions or exchange controls. To this end, a few changes have been made to the structure and content of the report. These aim to provide a more accu- rate and transparent description of the regulatory framework for current and capital transactions: • Introduction of a new category, “Foreign exchange markets,” with additional subcategories to describe the various market structures existing in member countries: Some of the information included in this category was previously incorporated into the description of the exchange rate arrangement. This new category describes foreign exchange markets in a more transparent way. • Change in the name of category II.2, “International security restrictions,” to “Exchange measures imposed for security reasons”: This change reflects the fact that restrictions on current payments and transfers may be imposed for both national and international security reasons. • Inclusion of de jure exchange rate arrangements in addition to the IMF staff ’s de facto clas- sification of the exchange rate arrangements: The description of the de jure arrangement in the “Exchange Arrangement” section of the country chapters is based solely on information provided by the authorities. In general, the report includes the description of exchange and trade systems as of end-2007. However, to ensure that it is as up-to-date as possible, in some cases reference is made to signifi- cant developments that occurred through end-July 2008. In addition to exchange measures imposed solely for security reasons, the report also provides information related to restrictions on current international payments and transfers and multiple currency practices (MCPs) maintained under either Article XIV or Article VIII of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement. This information consists of verbatim quotes from the latest IMF staff reports issued as of December 31, 2007, and repre- sents the views of IMF staff, which may not necessarily have been endorsed by the IMF Executive Board.2 Exchange measures imposed for security reasons include measures notified to the IMF in accordance with the relevant IMF Executive Board decision and other security restrictions.3 The report also includes a table on the de facto classification of exchange rate arrangements and monetary policy frameworks (Table 1). This classification provides summary information in a tabular format on the various features of the exchange rate arrangements in member countries in addition to the more detailed descriptions in the country chapters. The classification is based on the information available on members’ de facto arrangements, as analyzed by IMF staff, which may differ from countries’ officially announced (de jure) arrangements. Table 2 details the changes in 1In addition to the 185 IMF member countries, the report includes Hong Kong SAR (People’s Republic of China) as well as Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles (both Netherlands). 2If countries implement changes to these restrictions after the relevant IMF document is issued, these changes will be reflected in a subsequent edition of the AREAER, covering the year during which the IMF staff report that includes information on such changes is issued. 3The information on exchange measures imposed for security reasons is based solely on information provided by country authorities. xiii ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INTRODUCTION Table 1. De Facto Classification of Exchange Rate Arrangements and Monetary Policy Frameworks, End-April 2008 The classification system is based on the members’ actual, de facto regimes, which may differ from their officially announced, de jure arrangements. The system ranks exchange rate arrangements on the basis of their degree of flexibility and the existence of formal or informal commitments to an exchange rate path. It distinguishes among the more rigid forms of pegged regimes (such as currency board arrangements), other conventional pegged regimes against a single currency or a basket of currencies, exchange rate bands around a fixed peg, crawling peg arrangements, and exchange rate bands around crawling pegs, in order to help assess the implications of the choice of exchange rate regime for the degree of independence of monetary policy. It also includes a category to distinguish the exchange arrangements of countries that have no separate legal tender. The system presents members’ exchange rate regimes against alternative monetary policy frameworks in order to highlight the role of the exchange rate in broad economic policy and to illustrate that different exchange rate regimes can be consistent with similar monetary frameworks. The monetary policy frameworks listed are as follows: Exchange rate anchor The monetary authority stands ready to buy or sell foreign exchange at given quoted rates to maintain the exchange rate at its predetermined level or within a range (the exchange rate serves as the nominal anchor or intermediate target of monetary policy). These regimes cover exchange rate regimes with no separate legal tender, currency board arrangements, fixed pegs with or without bands, and crawling pegs with or without bands. Monetary aggregate target The monetary authority uses its instruments to achieve a target growth rate for a monetary aggregate, such as reserve money, M1, or M2, and the targeted aggregate becomes the nominal anchor or intermediate target of monetary policy. Inflation-targeting framework This involves the public announcement of medium-term numerical targets for inflation, with an institutional commitment by the monetary authority to achieve these targets. Additional key features include increased communication with the public and the markets about the plans and objectives of monetary policymakers and increased accountability of the central bank for its inflation objectives. Monetary policy decisions are guided by the deviation of forecasts of future inflation from the announced inflation target, with the inflation forecast acting (implicitly or explicitly) as the intermediate target of monetary policy. Other The country has no explicitly stated nominal anchor, but rather monitors various indicators in conducting monetary policy. This is also used when no relevant information on the country is available.

Starting March 11, 2008, the authorities fixed the value of the manat vis-à-vis a euro/U.S. dollar composite. The weights of the currencies in the composite are regularly changed to increase the weight of the euro. Thus, effective March 11, 2008, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from a crawling peg to a crawling band arrangement.

Effective January 1, 2008, Cyprus participates in a currency union (EMU) with 14 other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. Previously, Cyprus participated in the ERM II, and the pound fluctuated within a tight band: officially ±15% but in practice less than ±2.25%. As a result, effective January 1, 2008, the exchange rate arrangement of Cyprus has been reclassified from a pegged exchange rate within a horizontal band to independently floating.

Thus, the de facto classification of the exchange rate arrangement has been changed from a conventional pegged arrange- ment to managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate effective May 1, 2007. Following a period of stability, the exchange rate has shown consistently more flexibility since January 15, 2008. Thus, effective that date, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from a conventional pegged arrangement to managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate.

The Summary Features of Exchange Arrangements and Regulatory Frameworks for Current and Capital Transactions in Member Countries table (which appears at the end of this introduction) provides an overview of the characteristics of the exchange and trade systems of IMF member countries. The Country Table Matrix (which comprises the Appendix) provides a complete listing of the categories used in the database, and the Compilation Guide (which follows this introduction) includes definitions and explanations for the consistent application and interpretation of the categories and reflects the changes introduced this year to the AREAER. The Annex describes foreign exchange mar- kets—their role, the main types, and their trading arrangements. Overall Developments This report documents a continuing trend toward liberalization of controls on current and capital account transactions during 2006 and through mid-July 2007, and toward a strengthening of pru- dential rules. Overall, few countries introduced new controls or limitations on foreign exchange transactions during this period. The major trends and significant developments documented in the report are the following: • Unlike in previous years, when changes in exchange rate arrangements often leaned toward more fixity, this year changes tilt toward more adjustability. To cope with ongoing appreciation pressures and the depreciation of the U.S. dollar in the context of pegs or heavily managed floats, the role of intermediate regimes such as crawling bands and pegs has become more important, and the role of the euro has been enhanced. Policy responses have included increasing flexibility of float- ing regimes, leading to more independent floaters, although the overall share of the more flexible exchange rate arrangements remained the same. • The exchange rate remained the key anchor of the majority of members’ monetary frameworks, despite some increase in the flexibility of exchange rate arrangements. • Other changes, including rules for the operation of markets and taxes levied on exchange transac- tions, moved generally in the direction of liberalization, including by simplifying the exchange rate structure, allowing a greater role for market forces in currency trading, and relaxing controls on forward exchange markets. • The number of countries maintaining exchange restrictions or MCPs, other than those imposed solely for security reasons, increased slightly; however, the number of countries that have accepted Article VIII obligations and maintain exchange restrictions or MCPs has decreased to 21. Overall, 35 countries reported exchange restrictions and/or MCPs at end-2007. • The trend toward greater current account liberalization continued. Both trade-related measures and controls on invisible transactions were liberalized to a significant extent during the report- ing period. • Most changes introduced with regard to capital account transactions aimed at liberalizing con- trols; only a few controls were tightened. Controls were eased mainly on capital outflows, reflect- ing countries’ attempts to mitigate the effect of increased capital inflows by liberalizing capital outflows against the backdrop of comfortable foreign exchange reserve positions. • The majority of measures implemented in the financial sector were of a prudential nature, with only some changes to capital controls. Overall, both prudential measures and capital controls were liberalized, although prudential measures affecting commercial banks were tightened. The sections below highlight developments in the major areas covered in this edition of the AREAER.

Developments in Exchange Rate Arrangements The large categories of de facto exchange rate arrangements remained broadly stable in the report- ing period (Table 3).5 Since May 1, 2007, the proportion of hard pegs, soft pegs, and floating arrangements remained constant as a percentage of the membership as a whole. Floating arrange- ments and soft pegs, in equal proportions, accounted for about 90% of the membership. Most of the changes observed occurred within these two large categories. Table 2 details the changes in individual countries’ exchange rate arrangements, which exhibit the following broad trends: • Among soft pegs, conventional pegs and band systems decreased somewhat, in favor of arrange- ments that may allow more flexibility for dealing with risks related to macroeconomic and external shocks. Although the number of countries pegging to a basket remained constant, three countries exited this category (the Islamic Republic of Iran, Seychelles, and Vanuatu) and three countries entered (Kuwait, the Russian Federation, and Tunisia). An increased number of coun- tries opted for crawling pegs and bands, in particular with reference to a basket, including the Islamic Republic of Iran and Azerbaijan. • The number of independently floating arrangements increased, a tendency toward increased flexibility, which may be a response by some countries to continued appreciation pressures. Five countries implemented independently floating exchange rate arrangements in the past 12 months; the currencies of two central European countries (the Czech Republic and Hungary) became independently floating, the latter by the elimination of the exchange rate band for the forint; Zambia decreased interventions and allowed the kwacha to float, and Cyprus and Malta adopted the euro. • Overall, the exchange rate remains the single most important monetary anchor. More than 60% of IMF members use the exchange rate as a nominal anchor, including about 25% of members with floating arrangements that use the exchange rate as a reference to manage their float. • Several countries—even independent floaters—at times intervened in the foreign exchange market to dampen strong exchange rate pressures and build reserves. For example, interventions increased foreign exchange reserves by about 60% in Brazil and about 50% in the Philippines. 4The exchange rate arrangements maintained by IMF members are classified into eight categories: (1) hard pegs comprising (a) exchange arrangements with no separate legal tender, and (b) currency board arrangements; (2) soft pegs consisting of (a) conventional pegged arrangements, (b) pegged exchange rates within horizontal bands, (c) crawling pegs, and (d) crawling bands; and (3) floating regimes characterized as (a) managed floating with no prede- termined path for the exchange rate, and (b) independently floating. These categories are based on the flexibility of the arrangement and how it operates in practice—that is, the de facto regime is described, rather than the de jure or official description of the arrangement. The individual categories are defined in detail in the Compilation Guide. 5The AREAER covers developments in exchange rate arrangements through end-April 2008. xxi ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INTRODUCTION • The U.S. dollar continued to be the most widely used exchange rate anchor, followed by the euro. Against the backdrop of U.S. dollar depreciation, the euro’s role as an anchor increased in importance, particularly regarding its weight in the composition of the exchange rate baskets (e.g., Azerbaijan, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Kuwait, the Russian Federation, and Tunisia).6 • The number of inflation-targeting regimes increased. The flexibility of this framework and the sometimes poor results of alternative anchors have encouraged many authorities to target infla- tion directly. The effectiveness of this framework has, however, varied considerably. The overwhelming majority of countries report some kind of spot foreign exchange market; the share of countries with a forward market is only 63% (Table 5). More than half of IMF members report an interbank foreign exchange market.7 About 9% operate auctions for foreign exchange, either in addition to the interbank market (e.g., Nigeria) or as the sole foreign exchange market (e.g., Honduras).8 Mexico and Turkey, both with independently floating exchange rate arrange- ments, also used an auction as a transparent operational framework for managing reserves. Fewer than 5% implement exchange rate fixing. However, Mauritania recently introduced a rate-fixing session as a first step toward developing an interbank market. Other members have abandoned or are moving toward abandoning their fixing sessions (e.g., Serbia). Many foreign exchange market measures introduced during the reporting period seem directed toward facilitating foreign exchange operations (see Table 4): • Limitations on foreign exchange trading were relaxed in China and Vietnam and tightened in Lao P.D.R. The widening of the trading bands in spot foreign exchange transactions allows a greater role for market forces. • Most changes in controls on forward transactions involved easing controls, although there was tightening in some cases. For example, controls were eased on forward transactions in India, Malaysia, and Tunisia, whereas in Colombia controls were tightened as part of the package of measures implemented to limit capital inflows. These steps seem to represent part of a gradual process of liberalization, allowing market participants more flexibility to hedge foreign exchange exposures. • Official actions, such as the introduction of official rates disconnected from the market, created dual or multiple exchange rate structures in some countries (e.g., Angola, Eritrea, and São Tomé and Príncipe). Botswana’s exchange rate structure became unitary with the elimination of the previous MCP. Turkmenistan unified its official and commercial exchange rates. Argentina and Burundi also took steps to eliminate MCPs that were created by surrender requirements or fea- tures of the auction mechanism. • No major changes were recorded in foreign exchange taxes. Such taxes were increased in Brazil and Bolivia, continued to decrease in Ukraine, and were abolished in Uruguay. Ecuador intro- duced a 0.5% tax on certain remittances abroad. • Finally, a series of neutral changes were recorded. Cyprus and Malta adopted the euro, and the Slovak Republic entered the ERM II. Ghana and the República Bolivariana de Venezuela changed the denomination of their currencies. 6Tunisia does not publish currency composite weights; hence, the weights in the composition of the exchange rate basket have been estimated by the IMF staff. 7In fact, this number is higher, because some countries that obviously have an interbank market did not report that they have one. 8The special topic in the Annex provides a brief description of the various foreign exchange market structures. xxii ©International Monetary Fund.

Effective May 17, 2007, the requirement that exporters who fail to sell their export proceeds within the prescribed period of time surrender the proceeds to the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic at the reference rate on the date of sale or the reference rate on the date the sale should have taken place, whichever was less favorable, was suspended. Effective January 1, 2007, old manat banknotes, in use before the new manat banknotes were introduced, are no longer in circulation. Since January 1, 2008, the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus has Neutral been maintaining the exchange rate of the Belarusian rubel within a symmetrical horizontal band vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar (±2.5%) relative to the exchange rate of the Belarusian rubel against the U.S. dollar at the start of the year. Before that date, in addition to the U.S. dollar, the Belarusian rubel maintained a de jure target vis-à-vis the Russian ruble within a horiz- ontal band of ±4%. Effective October 1, 2007, the Central Bank of Bolivia (CBB) intro- duced a 1% commission on all transfers of foreign exchange to the private sector, except for export transactions taking place through the CBB. Effective January 2, 2008, the CBB introduced a 1% service charge on transfers from abroad to the financial system through the CBB, except (1) operations through the CBB for exporters and remittances equal to or less than $1,000, and (2) operations through the financial system for diplomatic corps, cooperation agencies, and international organizations, and remittances equal to or less than $1,000. Effective August 8, 2007, the previous multiple currency practice relating to exchange rate guarantees on one loan was eliminated with the conversion of the outstanding loan under the Foreign Exchange Risk Sharing scheme to a pula loan. Effective January 1, January 3, and March 13, 2008, Decrees 6.339, 6.345, and 6.391 increased the rate of tax and adjusted the situations in which tax is applied to foreign exchange transactions. Effective December 28, 2007, the exchange rate structure has been re- classified to dual. Previously, the exchange rate structure was multiple because, in addition to the potential deviation of the official rate and the market rate, the exchange rates on foreign exchange auctions could differ by more than 2%. However, the auction rules were changed to limit the potential variation of the rates. As of January 15, 2007, The number of market-maker banks increased to Neutral 22 from 21. Effective May 21, 2007, the band around the daily trading price of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar in the interbank foreign exchange spot market was widened from ±0.3% to ±0.5%. Effective May 6, 2007, the overall gross exposure of each participant in the foreign exchange derivative market may not exceed 500% of a participant’s total capital. Effective January 31, 2007, the floor for the colón’s crawl was changed to Easing of controls C 519.16 per $1 (previously, 514.78) and the ceiling to C 540.55 per $1 (previously, 530.22). No central parity was defined. Effective November 22, 2007, the floor of the crawling band was reduced Easing of controls by 4% to C 498.39 per $1 and the ceiling to C 562.83 per $1. The crawl of the band's floor was modified from zero to a negative daily adjustment of C 0.06, allowing for a 3% nominal annual appreciation of the colón, and the rate of crawl of the band's ceiling was reduced to C 0.06 a business day, resulting in a change of 3% a year. These changes widened the band to 13%. Easing of controls Easing of controls Tightening of controls ©International Monetary Fund.

Effective January 1, 2008, Cyprus adopted the euro as its official currency. Neutral Effective January 1, 2008, a 0.5% tax was introduced on remittances Tightening of controls abroad, with the following exceptions: import payments, profit repatri- ation, debt service, credit card transactions, and reinsurance premiums. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange rate structure has been reclassi- Tightening of controls fied from unitary to dual because, despite the unification of the exchange rate, the parallel market rate deviates significantly from the official ex- change rate. Effective July 1, 2007, Ghana redenominated the cedi by eliminating four zeros and thereby revaluing 10,000 cedis to 1 cedi and 100 pesewas to 1 pesewa. Effective November 26, 2007, the maximum daily amounts that may be acquired at auction were increased from $600,000 to the equivalent of $1,200,000 for legal entities and from $30,000 to $100,000 for ex- change bureaus. Effective October 29, 2007, resident individuals with foreign exchange exposures out of actual or anticipated remittances were permitted to book forward contracts without production of underlying documents, based on self-declaration. Effective October 29, 2007, small and medium-size enterprises with direct or indirect foreign exchange risk were permitted to book forward contracts without production of underlying documents. Effective February 8, 2008, authorized dealers may allow foreign insti- tutional investors to cancel and rebook forward contracts up to 2% of the market value of their entire investment in equity and/or debt in India. Effective February 8, 2007, commercial banks were required to adjust their buying and selling rates not exceeding ±0.25% of the daily refer- ence rate of the Bank of the Lao P.D.R. for the U.S. dollar. For the other currencies, commercial banks may adjust the margin between the buying and selling rates not exceeding 0.5%. Previously, margins between the buying and selling rates not exceeding 1.15% for the U.S. dollar applied. Effective April, 1, 2007, residents are allowed to hedge foreign currency loan repayment up to the full amount of the underlying commitment. Under the previous policy, hedging for foreign currency loan repayment was allowed only for a commitment of up to 24 months. Effective April 1, 2007, licensed onshore banks are allowed to appoint overseas branches of their banking group as a vehicle to facilitate the settlement of ringgit assets of their nonresident clients under certain conditions. Effective April 1, 2007, the requirement for a nonresident to reinvest within seven working days the proceeds arising from the sale of ringgit assets prior to the maturity of the forward foreign exchange contract was abolished. Effective January 1, 2008, Malta adopted the euro as its official currency. Neutral On January 25, 2007, the first rate-fixing session opened. Neutral Effective July, 1, 2007, the band in the interbank foreign exchange market Easing of controls has been eliminated. Effective January 1, 2008, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) announces Easing of controls the amount on offer on the day of the auction, and the auction results are released the same day. Funds purchased through the CBN are now eligible for trading in the interbank market. Effective April 30, 2007, separate limits for forward operations were eliminated and combined with the foreign currency cash position.

Effective June 25, 2007, the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) has abol- Tightening of controls ished the foreign exchange auction system. Effective July 30, 2007, the NBR started to sell foreign exchange directly Neutral to banks based on a predetermined reference price (based on price data from the interbank market, retail prices, and the previous day’s reference price). Effective August 1, 2007, the NBR introduced an adjustment factor to the Neutral price formula that ensures a gradual appreciation of the exchange rate. São Tomé and Effective December 5, 2007, the exchange rate structure is classified as Príncipe multiple as a result of the existence of multiple exchange rates, including the official exchange rate, the auction rate, commercial bank rates, ex- change bureau rates, and parallel market rates. Previously, the exchange rate structure was dual because of the potential deviation of the exchange rates applied by the commercial banks and the Banco Central de São Tomé and Príncipe reference rate between auctions. Effective January 1, 2007, according to the 2007 Policy Program of the Neutral National Bank of Serbia (NBS), the NBS may intervene in the foreign ex- change market for the purposes of limiting daily volatility, but not in order to resist cumulative pressure over a longer period; containing potential threats to financial and price stability; and safeguarding an adequate level of international reserves. Effective January 1, 2007, the NBS discontinued foreign exchange opera- Neutral tions with resident and nonresident natural persons at its foreign offices and automated teller machines in order to decrease its foreign cash opera- tions. Effective March 5, 2007, the NBS discontinued trade in foreign cash currencies other than euros, U.S. dollars, and francs with banks and licensed foreign offices. Effective January 1, 2007, the incentive fee paid by the NBS to foreign Neutral exchange dealers was reduced to 0.5% from 0.7%. The incentive fee was further lowered to 0.3% from 0.5% and, effective January 1, 2008, was reduced to zero. Effective March 5, 2007, the official middle exchange rate of the dinar against the euro is set at the start of each business day as the weighted average of the exchange rates applied in all individual interbank spot transactions in the foreign exchange market outside the fixing session and at the fixing session on the previous day. This rate applies on the day of calculation. Effective June 4, 2007, the NBS discontinued organizing daily fixing sessions and holds fixing sessions only on as-needed basis, when the NBS considers them necessary in order to stabilize the foreign exchange market. With the elimination of the daily fixing sessions, the NBS started to partic- ipate in the interbank foreign exchange market, through the Reuters Deal- ing System, by selling specific amounts of foreign exchange at the best quoted rate without the intention of influencing the market exchange rate. Effective September 1, 2007, the NBS closed the units in charge of ex- change transactions at 33 locations in Serbia. The NBS now deals with licensed exchange bureaus only at five branch offices. Effective January 1, 2008, the NBS has not renewed its agreements with Neutral exchange dealers, unless they have already concluded agreements on the performance of exchange transactions with one or more commercial banks. Slovak Republic Effective March 19, 2007, the European Central Bank and the National Neutral Bank of Slovakia established the new central rate of the Slovak koruna at Sk 35.4424 per _1.

The margin requirement was abolished December 30, 2007. Effective July 1, 2007, the Sudanese dinar has been replaced by the Sudanese guinea. Effective January 1, 2008, the spread between the buying and selling rates Easing of controls was set as a percentage instead of a fixed amount. Effective January 1, 2007, the public sector and the free market rates were Easing of controls unified, and thus the exchange rate structure was reclassified to the cate- gory dual from the category multiple. Effective March 3, 2008, domestic financial institutions are allowed to purchase foreign currencies against Baht for value same day or value next day without prior permission from the Bank of Thailand. For transactions without underlying trade or investment in Thailand, the total outstanding balance of each financial institution must not exceed B 300 million for each group of nonresidents. Effective December 18, 2007, authorized intermediaries were authorized Easing of controls to list foreign currency/dinar exchange options for their resident customers to enable them to hedge against the exchange risk generated by commercial operations involving goods and services and financial transactions. Author- ized intermediaries may engage among themselves in foreign currency/ dinar exchange option transactions to hedge against the exchange risk associated with their customers’ transactions. The maturity of the exchange option must be based on the settlement date for the underlying commercial or financial transaction, up to a limit of three years. The exercise price for the option as well as the premium may be freely negotiated between authorized intermediaries and their customers. Effective March 3, 2008, the performance of nonelectronic foreign ex- change operations by ADs with exchange bureaus is regulated. The rules applicable to forward transactions have been amended as of February 8, 2008. Effective March 10, 2008, the daily fixed amount of foreign exchange to Neutral be purchased by the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey was reduced to $15 million from $30 million. Effective April 20, 2007, the exchange rate structure has been reclassified Tightening of controls to dual from unitary as a result of the significant spread between the official and the parallel market rates. Since the unification of the exchange rate, the spread has diminished. Effective January 1, 2008, a commercial rate of manat 20,000 per $1 was Easing of controls introduced in addition to the official exchange rate. The official exchange rate was devalued to manat 6,250 per $1 from manat 5,200 per $1. No limits were set on purchases or sales of cash foreign currency by individuals. Effective May 1, 2008, the commercial rate and the official exchange rate Easing of controls were unified, and the new exchange rate was pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of manat 14,250 per $1. A uniform exchange rate of manat 14,250 per $1 applies to all eligible transactions at the Interbank Currency Exchange. Effective January 1, 2007, the fee on purchases of noncash-foreign exchange Easing of controls used for government pension insurance was lowered to 1% from 1.3%. Effective January 1, 2008, the fee on purchases of noncash foreign ex- change was lowered from 1% to 0.5% in the context of the budget for 2008. Effective September 18, 2007, the 2% tax on purchases of foreign ex- change by public sector institutions, except the Central Bank of Uruguay (CBU) and official banks, was abolished. Effective December 21, 2007, the CBU effectively withdrew from the forward market. Easing of controls Easing of controls Neutral Neutral Neutral xxvi ©International Monetary Fund.

The official exchange rate of the CBU is deter- mined once a week as the average ITS rate for the previous week and it remains in effect for one week. República Effective January 1, 2008, exchange transactions and their value in Bolivariana de bolívares must be reexpressed by dividing the amounts by 1,000. The Venezuela number of decimal places for defining the value of the exchange rates is set by the Central Bank of Venezuela. According to the new methodology, the exchange rate of the bolívar is Bs 2,144.600.000 (buying) and Bs 2,150.000.000 (selling) per $1. The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) widened the U.S. dollar-dong trading Easing of controls band, allowing banks to quote rates that vary up to ± 0.5%, effective Jan- uary 1, 2007, and up to ±0.75%, effective December 24, 2007, from the rate quoted by the SBV. Effective March 10, 2008, the SBV widened the U.S. dollar-dong trading Easing of controls band, allowing banks to quote rates that vary up to ±1% from the rate quoted by the SBV. Effective May 2, 2008, a new market-determined foreign exchange pricing Easing of controls framework was introduced. Authorized dealers may match buyers and sellers of foreign exchange according to a predetermined list of priorities and are required to submit to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe the details of the transactions they handle on a biweekly basis.

Member Countries’ Obligations and Status under Ar ticle VIII This section provides a brief overview of those countries that have accepted the obligations of Article VIII of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement. It also describes recent developments in exchange measures, including exchange restrictions and MCPs subject to the provisions of Article VIII. In addition, this section covers the restrictions that countries impose to protect national and international security. In accepting the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, members commit to refrain from imposing restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions and from engaging in discriminatory currency arrangements or MCPs, except with IMF approval. No member country has accepted Article VIII obligations since Montenegro became an IMF mem- ber in early 2007. As a result, 166 IMF member countries are in Article VIII status and 19 continue to avail themselves of the transitional arrangements of Article XIV. xxvii ©International Monetary Fund.

Restrictions and/or multiple currency practices Exchange Measures The salient features of exchange restrictions during 2007 are outlined in Table 6 and provided in more detail in Table 7. They can be summarized as follows: • The number of countries that maintain restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions and/or MCPs increased to 35 in 2007, from 34 in 2006. • Among countries that maintain some type of exchange restriction,9 the majority (21) have already accepted the obligations of Article VIII, and the remaining countries (14) avail themselves of the transitional arrangements of Article XIV. • The number of exchange restrictions increased slightly among both Article VIII and Article XIV countries. Against the increase of restrictions by 1 for both groups of countries, restrictions decreased mostly in the area of foreign exchange allowances for travel, education, and medical expenses, while restrictions increased with respect to imports and in other areas. 9The information on exchange restrictions and MCPs in the 2008 AREAER is based on the relevant IMF staff report issued before December 31, 2007. However, the AREAER does not indicate whether such exchange restric- tions or MCPs have been approved by the IMF. xxviii ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INTRODUCTION Table 7. Types of Restrictions and/or Multiple Currency Practices Maintained by Countries, December 31, 2007 (Based on information in published IMF staff repor ts)1 Country Albania Angola Aruba Bangladesh Bhutan Bosnia Burundi Colombia Restrictions and/or Multiple Currency Practices The IMF staff report for the third review under the three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility states that, as of June 22, 2007, Albania’s exchange rate arrangement was free of exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to IMF jurisdiction under Article VIII. However, the country still availed itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV and maintained exchange restrictions in the form of outstanding debit balances on inoperative bilateral payment agreements, which were in place before Albania became an IMF member. These relate primarily to debt in nonconvertible and formerly nonconvertible currencies, which the authorities were working to resolve by end-2007. (Country Report No. 07/244) The IMF staff report for the 2007 Article IV consultation with Angola states that, as of August 6, 2007, Angola maintained exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to approval under Article VIII, Sections 2 and 3. The identified exchange restrictions include a limit on the remittance of dividends and profits from foreign investments of up to $100,000 and the need for prior approval on business-related current invisible transactions. Multiple currency practices arise from the differential in spot exchange rates among the Bank of Angola’s currency auction, interbank market, and retail foreign exchange market. A foreign exchange stamp tax applicable to electronic remittances constitutes both an exchange restriction and a multiple currency practice. (Country Report No. 07/354) The IMF staff report for the 2005 Article IV consultation with the Kingdom of the Netherlands—Aruba states that, as of April 11, 2005, Aruba maintained a foreign exchange restriction arising from the foreign exchange tax on payments by residents to nonresidents. This tax, which amounts to 1.3% of the transaction value, was introduced when Aruba was part of the Netherlands Antilles to generate revenue for the government. Aruba adopted it after gaining autonomy in 1986. Since then, it has served as a source of general tax revenue for the central government of Aruba. (Country Report No. 05/204) The IMF staff report for the 2007 Article IV consultation with Bangladesh states that, as of May 31, 2007, Bangladesh maintained a restriction on the convertibility and transferability of proceeds of current international transactions in nonresident taka accounts. (Country Report No. 07/234) The IMF staff report for the 2007 Article IV consultation with Bhutan states that, as of September 20, 2007, Bhutan maintained exchange restrictions in connection with: (1) the availability of foreign exchange for travel, invisibles, and private transfers; (2) foreign exchange balancing requirements on remittances of income from foreign direct investment; and (3) the availability of foreign exchange for importers who have not provided evidence that goods for which payments have been made were actually imported. Changes to Bhutan’s import licensing rules in 2005, which introduced new foreign exchange balancing requirements for certain imports, gave rise to exchange restrictions subject to IMF approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a). (Country Report No. 07/350) The IMF staff report for the 2007 Article IV consultation with Bosnia and Herzegovina states that, as of June 29, 2007, Bosnia and Herzegovina maintained restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions resulting from measures taken with respect to frozen foreign currency deposits. (Country Report No. 07/268) The IMF staff report for the sixth review under the arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility with Burundi states that, as of December 28, 2007, Burundi maintained one multiple currency practice (MCP) inconsistent with Article VIII, Section 2(a): the exchange rate used for government transactions [takes place at a rate that] may differ by more than 2% from market exchange rates. (Country Report No. 08/27) An MCP inconsistent with Article VIII, Section 3, previously arose from or in connection with the Dutch auction system and an exchange restriction resulted from the central bank having discretion to refuse authorization for the sale of foreign exchange for reasons other than in connection with verifying the bona fide nature of the transaction. These were eliminated July 7, 2006, and December 6, 2006, respectively. The IMF staff report for the 2007 Article IV consultation with Colombia states that, as of Decem- ber 26, 2007, Colombia maintained two exchange measures subject to Fund approval under Article VIII: (1) a multiple currency practice and an exchange restriction arising from a tax on outward remittances of nonresident profits that were earned before 2007 and have been retained in the country for less than five years; and (2) an exchange restriction arising from the special regime for the hydrocarbon sector. Branches of foreign corporations are required either to surrender their export proceeds or to agree to a government limitation on their access to the foreign exchange market. While Colombia is free under the Articles to impose surrender requirements and to exempt the application of those requirements, conditioning such exemptions on the acceptance of limitations on the availability of foreign exchange for the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions is inconsistent with Article VIII, Section 2(a).

Effective December 26, 2007, the tax on outward remittances was eliminated for remittances of profits earned in 2007 and beyond, in accordance with Law 1111 and applies only in respect of profits earned before 2007 and retained in the country for less than five years. Congo, Dem. The IMF staff report for the 2007 Article IV consultation with the Democratic Republic of the Rep. of Congo states that, as of August 15, 2007, the Democratic Republic of the Congo maintained measures that give rise to one restriction and one multiple currency practice (MCP) subject to IMF approval under Article VIII. The exchange restriction involves an outstanding net debit position vis-à-vis other contracting members under the inoperative regional payments agreement with the CEPGL. The MCP involves a fixed exchange rate set on a quarterly basis applying to transactions through the bilateral payments agreement with Zimbabwe. (Country Report No. 07/327) The IMF staff report for the 2005 Article IV consultation with Ecuador states that, as of January 5, 2006, Ecuador maintains an exchange restriction subject to IMF approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a), in the form of a freeze on demand and savings deposits held in closed banks managed by the Deposit Guarantee Agency. (Country Report No. 06/98) The IMF staff report for the 2007 Article IV consultation with Ethiopia states that, as of May 18, 2007, Ethiopia maintained four restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions, which relate to (1) the tax certification requirement for repatriation of dividend and other investment income; (2) restrictions on repayment of legal external loans and supplies and foreign partner credits; (3) rules for issuance of import permits by commercial banks; and (4) the requirement to provide a clearance certificate from NBE to obtain import permits. (Country Report No. 07/247) The IMF staff report for the 2006 Article IV consultation with Guinea states that, as of December 7, 2007, Guinea continues to have a multiple currency practice (MCP) arising from the absence of a mechanism to prevent a potential deviation of the exchange rate used by the central bank in its foreign exchange transactions from the exchange rates used by the commercial banks in transactions with their customers. (Country Report No. 08/33) The IMF staff report for the 2007 Article IV consultation with India states that, as of December 27, 2007, India maintained the following restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, which are subject to IMF approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a): (1) restrictions related to the nontransferability of balances under the India-Russia debt agreement, (2) restrictions arising from unsettled balances under inoperative bilateral payments arrangements with two Eastern European countries, and (3) a restriction on the transfer of amortization payments on loans by nonresident relatives. (Country Report No. 08/51) Iran, Islamic The IMF staff report for the 2006 Article IV consultation with the Islamic Republic of Iran states Republic of that, as of February 1, 2007, Iran maintains one exchange restriction and two multiple currency practices (MCPs) subject to IMF jurisdiction under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3. The exchange restriction arises from limitations set out in the by-laws adopted to implement the Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Act on the transferability of (periodic) rial profits from certain foreign direct investments. The MCPs arise from (1) budget subsidies for foreign exchange purchases in connection with payments of certain letters of credit opened prior to March 21, 2002, under the previous multiple exchange rate system and (2) obligations of entities that had received allocations of foreign exchange at subsidized “allocated rates” under the previous multiple exchange rate system to surrender unused allocations to the Central Bank of Iran at the allocation rate. (Country Report No. 07/100) The IMF staff report for the 2007 Article IV consultation with the Lao People’s Democratic Republic states that, as of July 20, 2007, Lao P.D.R. maintained a restriction subject to IMF approval under Article VIII: tax payment certificates are required for some current account transactions. (Country Report No. 07/360) The IMF staff report for the second review under the Stand-By Arrangement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia states that, as of April 11, 2007, FYR Macedonia maintained an exchange restriction subject to IMF approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a), arising from restrictions imposed on the transferability of proceeds from current international transactions contained in former frozen foreign currency saving deposits. (Country Report No. 07/257) The IMF staff report for the 2006 Article IV consultation states that, as of February 1, 2007, Malawi maintained a multiple currency practice (MCP) under Article VIII. As the authorities have ceased the informal rationing of foreign exchange and there is no longer a backlog of arrears on import payments, the exchange restriction evidenced by these arrears has been eliminated. IMF staff is assessing whether the official action that gave rise to the MCP has ceased. (Country Report No. 07/147) Macedonia FYR Lao P.D.R. Malawi xxx ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INTRODUCTION Table 7 (continued) Country Restrictions and/or Multiple Currency Practices Myanmar Mozambique The IMF staff report for the first review under the Policy Support Instrument with the Republic of Mozambique states that, as of December 3, 2007, Mozambique maintained restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions subject to IMF approval under Article VIII, as evidenced by (1) discretionary prior approval for remittances of family living expenses, (2) authorization requirements for the purchase of foreign exchange in excess of US$5,000 for certain transactions; (3) prohibition on the conversion of balances of nonresidents’ domestic currency accounts into foreign currency and their transfer abroad, (4) prohibition of advance payments for services, and (5) prohibition of advance payments for the importation of goods. (Country Report No. 08/15) The IMF staff report for the 2007 Article IV consultation with Myanmar states that, as of November 5, 2007, Myanmar maintained exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to IMF approval under Article VIII arising from (1) limits on the purchase of foreign exchange by residents for foreign travel and by nonresidents for the remittable portion of wages, as well as for payments and transfers relating to invisible and other current international transactions, and (2) the divergence between the official exchange rate used for transactions of the public sector and the parallel market- determined foreign exchange certificate (FEC) rate. São Tomé and The IMF staff report for the fifth review of the Three-Year Arrangement with São Tomé and Príncipe Principe states that, as of December 5, 2007, São Tomé and Príncipe maintained an exchange restriction on transfers abroad of dividends and multiple currency practices related to the occasional shortage of foreign exchange in the formal market that results from the rationing by the central bank of foreign exchange sold at auctions, and the existence of multiple exchange markets (i.e., the official rate, the auction rate, commercial bank rates, exchange bureau rates, and the rates of the parallel market) in the absence of a mechanism to ensure that spreads among rates for spot transactions in these markets do not diverge by more than 2% at any given time. (Country Report No. 08/95) The IMF staff report for the 2007 Article IV consultation with Sri Lanka states that, as of November 7, 2007, all import margin requirements (50%) with respect to certain goods (which are a “normal short term banking and credit facility” under Article XXX(d)), introduced in October 2006, were removed in May 2007, but that the 100% margin requirements on the import of certain vehicles remained in place. (Country Report No. 07/373) The IMF staff report for the 2007 Article IV consultation with Sudan states that, as of August 7, 2007, Sudan had (until June 2007) maintained an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. On June 4, 2007, the Central Bank of Sudan (CBOS) introduced a cash margin requirement for letters of credit and import credit that constitutes an exchange restriction and multiple currency practice under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3. (Country Report No. 07/343) The IMF staff report for the 2007 Article IV consultation with Suriname states that, as of March 6, 2007, Suriname maintained multiple currency practices subject to IMF approval. The multiple currency practices arise from the potential for the spread to exceed 2% between the official and the commercial exchange rates and from the existence of a special exchange rate for imports of baby milk. (Country Report No. 07/180) The IMF staff report for the 2007 Article IV consultation with Swaziland states that, as of January 16, 2007, Swaziland maintained an exchange restriction arising from a 33.33% limit on advance payments for imports of capital goods. (Country Report No. 07/132) Syrian Arab The IMF staff report for the 2007 Article IV consultation with the Syrian Arab Republic states Republic that, as of July 13, 2007, Syria maintained, under Article XIV, restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions, including administrative allocation of foreign exchange. Syria also maintained exchange measures that are subject to IMF approval under Article VIII: (1) prohibition against purchases by private parties of foreign exchange from the banking system for some current international transactions; (2) a multiple currency practice resulting from divergences of more than 2% between the official exchange rate and officially recognized market exchange rates; (3) a non-interest-bearing advance import deposit requirement of 75–100% for public sector imports; and (4) an exchange restriction arising from the net debt under inoperative bilateral payments arrangements with the Islamic Republic of Iran and Sri Lanka. (Country Report No. 07/288) The IMF staff report for the 2007 Article IV consultation with Tonga states that, as of July 10, 2007, Tonga imposed an exchange restriction subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a), in the form of a tax certification requirement imposed on certain current international transactions.

Not for Redistribution INTRODUCTION Table 7 (concluded) Country Tunisia Zambia Restrictions and/or Multiple Currency Practices The IMF staff report for the 2007 Article IV consultation with Tunisia states that, as of July 13, 2007, Tunisia maintained a multiple currency practice resulting from honoring exchange rate guarantees extended prior to August 1988 to development banks, which will automatically expire after maturity of existing commitments. (Country Report No. 07/302) The IMF staff report for the 2007 Article IV consultation with Zambia states that, as of November 21, 2007, Zambia maintained an exchange restriction evidenced by the accumulation of external payments arrears, which is subject to IMF approval under Article VIII. (Country Report No. 08/41) Source: IMF staff reports. 1The measures described in this table are quoted from IMF staff reports issued as of December 31, 2007, and may have changed subsequent to the date when they were reported. The table does not include countries maintaining exchange restric- tions or multiple currency practices whose staff reports are unpublished without the constent of the authorities. • The types of exchange restrictions vary across countries. The most widely used restrictions are quantitative limits on the making of payments and transfers for current invisible transactions. In total, 51 restrictions are retained on payments for invisibles and other current transfers in the form of quantitative limits (e.g., Angola, Bhutan, and the Syrian Arab Republic) and documen- tary requirements on foreign exchange allowances for certain current international transactions, including payments for travel and profit remittances (e.g., Ethiopia and Tonga require tax certifi- cation for these transactions). • Other types of exchange restrictions include limits on advance payments for certain imports (e.g., Swaziland), restrictions arising from the accumulation of private external payments arrears (e.g., Zambia), and restrictions arising from bilateral or regional payments agreements (e.g., Albania, India, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo). • A number of countries (17) also maintained measures that give rise to MCPs, subject to IMF approval under Article VIII. In most cases (e.g., Angola, Burundi, Guinea, São Tomé and Príncipe, Suriname, and the Syrian Arab Republic), the MCPs result primarily from multiple exchange markets and exchange rates (the official rate, the auction rate, commercial bank rates, exchange bureau rates, and the rates of the parallel market) that may lead to diver- gences of more than 2% between the official exchange rate and the rates for spot transactions in these markets. The average number of exchange restrictions is significantly lower in countries that have accepted Article VIII obligations than in countries with Article XIV status. On average, the number of exchange restrictions per member is only 2 for countries with Article VIII status compared with 3.3 for those with Article XIV status. • As in 2006, a number of countries eliminated exchange restrictions during 2007 in order to gain the benefits of liberalization.10 Three member countries (Botswana, Pakistan, and the Russian Federation) eliminated exchange restrictions/MCPs and are described in the relevant IMF staff reports as maintaining exchange systems free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. In addition, Burundi eliminated one exchange restriction resulting from the central bank having discretion to refuse authorization for the sale of for- eign exchange for reasons other than in connection with verifying the bona fide nature of the transaction and an MCP related to the foreign exchange auction system. Colombia removed a restriction related to the tax on remittances of nonresident profits earned in 2007 and beyond, and Malawi eliminated an exchange restriction by eliminating the informal rationing of foreign exchange, which previously resulted in a backlog of arrears. • For six countries, there was not enough information available in 2007 to assess the existence of exchange restrictions.11 10See “Article VIII Acceptance by IMF Members—Recent Trends and Implications for the Fund,” May 16, 2006, www.imf.org. 11A standard review of the exchange systems of some of these countries was under way in 2007. xxxii ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INTRODUCTION • One country (Sudan) introduced a cash margin requirement for letters of credit and import credit that constitutes an exchange restriction and MCP under the provisions of Article VIII of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement. Restrictions maintained for security reasons Member countries continued to notify the IMF of restrictions introduced for national and inter- national security reasons during the current reporting period. Exchange restrictions must be reported to the IMF, regardless of their purpose.12 In total, 24 country authorities fulfilled the obligation during 2007 and early 2008 in notifying the IMF of security-related restrictions. All these countries (mostly advanced economies) reported that they imposed financial sanctions and restrictions to combat financial terrorism, in accordance with relevant UN Security Council resolutions or EU regulations. Regulatory Framework for Foreign Exchange Transactions This section documents major developments in arrangements for payments and receipts, trade- related (export/import) measures, payments for invisible transactions and current transfers, regula- tions on resident and nonresident accounts, and international capital transactions. The following are the broad features of these measures in three major categories: trade-related measures, current invisible transactions, and capital controls. Trade-Related Measures Exchange and trade restrictions on exports and imports are covered under the category of trade- related measures. In general, the trend toward liberalization of trade-related measures continued in the current reporting period. Out of 102 measures reported by countries in the category of imports and import payments, the majority (65) were aimed at liberalization of controls, including removal of import bans on certain goods, reductions in tariff rates, and elimination of documentation requirements for certain types of imports. In addition, some countries (e.g., Sri Lanka) abolished certain margin requirements on imports. Tightening measures on imports and import payments included mostly import prohibitions and increases in import duty rates on certain goods. A similar easing of controls was observed in measures governing exports and export proceeds. Only 53 changes were reported in this category. The fact that there were so many fewer changes for exports than imports reflects generally less restrictive regulation of exports. Out of the 53 changes, 28 involved liberalization of export controls, including reduction or removal of repatriation and surrender requirements for export proceeds. For example, Brazil allowed exporters to retain abroad all proceeds received from their shipments and services rendered abroad. Serbia eliminated the repatriation requirement for profits by legal entities operating abroad. Measures that tightened regulation on exports included the imposition of licensing requirements and increases in export duty rates on certain goods. For example, in response to the current global surge in food and energy prices, some countries increased the export duty on fuels (e.g., Argentina) and some have prohibited exports of certain food items (e.g., Bolivia). Current Invisible Transactions Overall, exchange controls on current invisible transactions declined during the reporting period. Of the 35 liberalization measures in this category, the majority were either to abolish or raise the quantita- tive limits on the availability of foreign exchange for making payments for invisible transactions and current transfers. A number of countries also relaxed the documentation and/or approval requirements 12A member should notify the IMF before imposing such measures. The notifications are immediately distributed to the Board. The member may assume that the IMF has no objection unless the IMF informs the member otherwise within 30 days of the notification. The IMF’s approval of an exchange restriction pursuant to Decision No. 144- (52/51) is granted for an unlimited period of time. xxxiii ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INTRODUCTION for these transactions. For example, China increased the limit on foreign exchange purchases by resi- dents for current transactions, and the Syrian Arab Republic adopted a new investment regulation that allows free transfer of all profits and dividends. With respect to regulations related to resident and non- resident accounts, the majority of countries moved toward liberalizing controls, allowing residents and nonresidents more access to foreign currency accounts to facilitate their current international transac- tions. For example, the Russian Federation eliminated the prior registration requirement for residents opening accounts abroad. In Tunisia, residents are now allowed to open travel allowance accounts in convertible dinars to hold foreign exchange issued for travel purposes and not used abroad. Capital Controls The observed trend toward liberalization of controls on international capital transactions over the past few years continued during the current reporting period. Member countries reported 205 changes in various categories of capital controls, including controls on capital and money market instruments, credit operations, foreign direct investment (FDI), real estate, and personal capital transactions. Of these changes, a large majority liberalized capital controls in general and eased controls on capital and money market and derivative instruments, in particular. For example, Thailand eliminated the 30% unremunerated reserve requirement for investment in debt securities and unit trusts introduced in late 2006. Malaysia now allows residents to issue foreign currency bonds locally. Controls on FDI were mostly eased, with an emphasis on the liberalization of capital outflows (out of 32 FDI liberalization measures, 19 affected outflows and 13 inflows). For example, the Philippines and Thailand raised the limit on outward investment and eliminated the prior approval requirement up to that limit. Controls on FDI inflows were also liberalized in several member countries. For example, India increased the limit on FDI inflows in certain sectors. Other capital control measures also tended toward liberalization. Many countries reported easing controls on real estate transactions, allowing residents (nonresidents) to acquire real estate abroad (domestically). For example, India and the Republic of Korea raised the limit on purchases of real estate abroad by residents. In Bulgaria, nonresidents (from EU member countries) are now allowed to purchase or own land locally. Similarly, the majority of changes reported by countries for credit operations and personal capital transactions were also in the direction of greater easing. Barbados, China, India, and Thailand raised limits on personal capital transactions. Azerbaijan and Poland eliminated the approval requirements for the transfer of assets and gifts. In the area of portfolio investments, China increased the limit on purchases of shares by a group of foreign institutional investors. Among the tightening measures, the majority entailed the introduction of limits and approval requirements, mainly on credit operations. For example, Thailand reduced the limit that nonresidents may lend to domestic financial institutions from 50 million baht to 10 million baht, regardless of maturities. Belarus introduced permission requirements (changed from notification) for certain credit operations between residents and nonresidents. Provisions Specific to Commercial Banks and Institutional Investors This section reviews developments in provisions specific to commercial banks and institutional investors, with a focus on prudential measures that are in the nature of capital controls.13 The section “Provisions Specific to the Financial Sector” covers monetary, prudential, and foreign exchange controls.14 It includes, among other things, borrowing abroad, lending to nonresidents, 13Capital controls and prudential measures are highly intertwined owing to their overlapping application. For example, some prudential measures (e.g., different reserve requirements for deposit accounts held by residents and nonresidents) can actually be regarded as capital controls because they distinguish between transactions with resi- dents and nonresidents and hence influence capital flows. 14Inclusion of an entry in this category does not necessarily indicate that the aim of the measure is to control the flow of capital. xxxiv ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INTRODUCTION Table 8. Changes in the Provisions Specific to the Financial Sector, 2007–End-July 2008 Provisions Specific to the Financial Sector Co mmercial banks and other credit institutions Institutional investors Type of Control _____________________________________________________ _________________________ Prudential _________________________ Capital Easing Tightening Neutral Easing Tightening Neutral 23 8 33 3 13 5 16 15 12 3 8 4 purchases of locally issued securities denominated in foreign exchange, and investment regulations. These provisions may be similar or identical to the entries under the respective categories of con- trols on capital and money market instruments, credit operations, and direct investments, if the same regulations apply to commercial banks as to other residents. In such cases, the entry also appears in the relevant category in the section “Capital Transactions.” The principal changes in this category during 2007 and through end-July 2008 are presented in Table 8 and may be summarized as follows: • For provisions specific to commercial banks and other credit institutions, the majority of the changes reported were prudential-type controls (69 of 105 measures in this category could be categorized as prudential controls). Although most countries moved toward liberalizing capital controls in this category, prudential regulations were generally tightened. The most important types of tighten- ing included increases in reserve requirements for commercial banks and other credit institutions (e.g., India, Peru, and Seychelles) and tighter limits on foreign exchange positions (e.g., Brazil and Mongolia). To mitigate the indirect exchange rate risk of the financial sector, some countries tightened prudential regulations to limit lending in foreign exchange to residents (e.g., the Republic of Korea and Vietnam). On the other hand, liberalization of provisions for commercial banks and other credit institutions included relaxation or removal of foreign exchange exposure limits (e.g., Malaysia and Pakistan); reduction or unification of reserve requirements in domestic and foreign currency deposits (e.g., Cyprus, Haiti, Georgia, Mozambique, and Slovenia); and higher limits on foreign currency lending by banks (e.g., the Syrian Arab Republic). • Changes in capital controls in the banking sector were in line with trends in other sectors. Out of the 30 measures introduced during the reporting period, 16 changes were toward liberaliza- tion and only 12 toward tightening. The majority of liberalizing measures involved relaxation of regulations allowing resident banks to extend loans in foreign currency to residents or to invest abroad. For example, the Syrian Arab Republic now allows banks to lend in foreign exchange to residents to finance investment projects. In Tunisia, resident banks may now extend short-term dinar loans to nonresident firms. Tighter measures for banks included the introduction of reserve requirements for foreign currency borrowing by banks (e.g., Ukraine) and limits on the sale in foreign currency of shares by banks to nonresidents (e.g., Tajikistan). Unlike changes in the provisions specific to commercial banks and other credit institutions, the majority of changes in the provisions specific to nonbank financial institutions were related to changes in capital controls (16 of 38 measures were related to prudential regulations). In addition, the direction of changes in these measures was different from those in commercial banks and credit institutions, with 23 measures (8 prudential controls and 15 capital controls) moving toward an easing of controls. The most notable of these was the easing of controls on insurance companies, pension funds, and unit trust management companies, allowing them to invest abroad a larger pro- portion of the assets under their management. For example, Peru increased the operational limit on investment abroad by private pension funds to 17% from 12%. Similarly, Malaysia increased the amount resident institutional investors may invest in foreign currency assets. A number of reported changes in the provisions specific to the financial sector could not be linked directly to the easing or tightening of rules. These changes were made mainly to allow the creation or development of prudential oversight instruments and institutions. As a result, these changes are recorded as neutral and institutional changes. They include most of the changes to methods for xxxv ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INTRODUCTION calculating net open positions of banks, amending procedures for the prevention of money launder- ing, and establishing prescriptions for determining the technical provisions of insurance companies. Some other measures simply reflect new circumstances, most notably changes in the remuneration of reserves (except when remuneration was eliminated, which is considered tightening). During the reporting period, the number of such neutral and institutional financial sector measures was higher than during the reporting period for the 2007 AREAER. Annex: Foreign Exchange Markets Deep and liquid financial markets help absorb external shocks, facilitate the conduct of monetary policy, and ensure efficient financing of the budget. They provide participants with a variety of means to conduct their operations and develop products for better risk management. Nonfinancial economic agents benefit from alternatives to bank financing and from being able to achieve a better risk-return trade-off on their investments. The foreign exchange market is often the first financial market to develop, and is sometimes the only financial market in a country. This annex provides some background information on the orga- nization of foreign exchange markets. The Role of Foreign Exchange Markets A well-functioning foreign exchange market contributes to economic development by facilitat- ing international trade, payments, and investment. The organization and operation of the foreign exchange market are largely dependent on the size of the financial system, regulatory and institu- tional arrangements, and the overall development of the economy.15 One of the functions of a foreign exchange market is price discovery. This function is often con- strained by regulation or by the nature of the exchange rate arrangement. Market imperfections are also common, for example when prices are distorted by the actions of a dominant market partici- pant, or by collusion among dealers. Regulation is one of the main determinants of foreign exchange market microstructure in developing economies.16 Regulation affects who may participate in the market, the sources and permitted uses of foreign exchange, and trading conditions. For example, the authorities may limit the margin that dealers may apply in their quotes. Regulation may also prevent the development of certain market seg- ments or instruments, and controls on forward and other derivative transactions are commonly used. The prevailing exchange rate arrangement also has an effect on the operation of the market, although, in practice, different trading mechanisms can be found in various exchange rate arrangements. Even though de facto floating arrangements may be more conducive to interbank market development, many countries with de jure or de facto pegs have active interbank foreign exchange markets. Types of Foreign Exchange Markets Spot and forward markets Spot markets are the first foreign exchange markets to develop. Spot transactions involve the pur- chase and sale of foreign exchange for immediate delivery, which in practice means settlement in two days. In many countries, regulations permit the purchase of spot foreign exchange only for payments for legitimate international transactions. In some countries, the predominant market is the cash market, which is by nature a spot market. The predominance of cash transactions may result 15For a more detailed discussion of the issues related to financial markets and in particular foreign exchange markets in small developing countries, see Hervé Ferhani, Mark Stone, Anna Nordstrom, and Seichii Shimizu, Developing Essential Financial Markets in Smaller Economies: Stylized Facts and Policy Options, IMF occasional paper, forthcoming, 2008. 16Canales-Kriljenko, Jorge, 2004, “Foreign Exchange Market Organization in Selected Developing and Transition Economies: Evidence from a Survey,” IMF Working Paper 04/4. xxxvi ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INTRODUCTION from the inability of local banks to provide adequate services, a lack of confidence in the banking sector, or government policies. Often, foreign exchange bureaus are the main intermediaries in foreign exchange transactions in countries where the cash market is prevalent. Forward foreign exchange markets involve contracts for the delivery or receipt of foreign exchange at some specified future date. These markets are useful for hedging exchange rate risk in international transactions. Forward markets are less widespread than spot markets. As noted above, the develop- ment of forward markets is often constrained by regulation. There may be an explicit prohibition against forward foreign exchange transactions, or a requirement that forward contracts cover only risk related to legitimate foreign exchange transactions, for example, export or import transactions. In some countries, the terms of forward contracts are set by regulation—for example, the interest rate used to price the forward contract. Even in the absence of regulatory constraints on forward transac- tions, the authorities’ explicit or implicit commitment to a specific exchange rate level may give mar- kets the impression that there is an implicit exchange rate guarantee; this perception tends to reduce incentives to hedge exchange rate risk. Development of forward foreign exchange markets may also be impeded by shallow domestic money markets and by the absence of an interest rate yield curve on which to base the pricing of forward contracts, particularly at longer terms. Of fshore and onshore markets At the early stages of market development, the foreign exchange market usually operates onshore, that is, subject to the domestic jurisdiction of the country. In the context of limited currency con- vertibility, regulations usually prohibit the trading of domestic currency and the holding of foreign currency accounts abroad. These regulations are often complemented by limitations on exports and imports of domestic banknotes. As a result, the domestic currency is unavailable outside the coun- try, and its trading takes place only in the domestic foreign exchange market. Despite these prohi- bitions, cash markets often develop offshore, in particular in neighboring countries, with domestic currency supplied by tourists. Prohibitions against forward transactions may lead to the emergence of an offshore nondeliverable forward market.17 These markets allow foreign investors in a country to hedge their exchange rate risk. At times, they have also allowed speculators to take positions against pegged exchange rate regimes perceived to be unsustainable. Unified and dual markets Foreign exchange markets may be either unified or segmented. Advantages of a unified market include greater liquidity, improved price discovery, lower short-run exchange rate volatility, and more reliable access to foreign exchange. Dual or multiple official markets can be found in countries with dual or multiple exchange rates. For example, a country may have a foreign exchange market for current transactions and another market at a different exchange rate for capital transactions. In other cases, an official exchange rate set by the central bank may apply to certain transactions, mainly transactions with the government or public enterprises, and a market exchange rate deter- mined by market participants may apply to other transactions, effectively segmenting the market. Often, a parallel market exists in addition to the official market(s). If the parallel market operates largely at the same price as the official market, the existence of a parallel market may be a sign of market dysfunction, including high fees or taxes on foreign exchange transactions through com- mercial banks, or an insufficient number of locations (foreign exchange bureaus or bank branches) where foreign currency can be exchanged. A parallel market with a significant premium over the official exchange rate may signal distortions in the official foreign exchange market, for example, a scarcity of foreign exchange at the official exchange rate. 17For a more detailed discussion on the development of offshore nondeliverable forward markets, see Ma, Guonan, Corrinne Ho, and Robert N. McCauley, 2004, “The markets for non-deliverable forwards in Asian Currencies,” BIS Quarterly Review, June 2004. xxxvii ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INTRODUCTION Trading Arrangements The role of the central bank Central banks may play various roles in the foreign exchange market. At one extreme, the central bank may intermediate all or almost all foreign exchange flows. The dominance of the central bank may result from structural factors or may reflect a policy choice. Central banks may intermediate a significant portion of foreign exchange inflows for structural reasons when, for example, the major source of foreign exchange in a country is foreign aid, or when oil exports by a public company are channeled through the central bank. Policy choices may include a general surrender requirement to the central bank, which effectively centralizes all foreign exchange inflows subject to surrender in the central bank and requires the redistribution of foreign exchange to the market. At the other end of the spectrum, the central bank may not participate in the foreign exchange market at all, and transactions and price-setting may be the exclusive province of dealers, including commercial banks and exchange bureaus. The development of the foreign exchange market entails the partial or complete withdrawal of the central bank from intermediating foreign exchange flows. However, even as it reduces its own intermediation, the central bank still has a role to play in facilitating the development of the mar- ket, usually through measures aimed at enhancing confidence in market participants and market mechanisms, for example, the establishment of a clear legal and supervisory framework for foreign exchange payments and settlements. Even once a well-functioning interbank foreign exchange market has developed, the central bank will often continue to conduct foreign exchange market operations aimed at implementing a particular exchange rate policy or arrangement, such as a con- ventional pegged arrangement or managed floating. Several types of trading mechanisms can be distinguished based on the extent and nature of cen- tral bank participation. These include allocation, auction, fixing, and an interbank market, and are discussed below. Allocation Allocation involves redistribution of foreign exchange inflows by the central bank to market participants for international transactions. Central banks sometimes intermediate all or almost all foreign exchange flows. This function may be supported by a general surrender requirement, obligating foreign exchange earners to sell their foreign exchange receipts to the central bank directly or through commercial banks. The foreign exchange thus centralized is in turn allocated by the central bank to finance international transactions by the public and private sectors. Requests to buy foreign exchange must be submitted to the central bank or to commercial banks, and the central bank determines the amounts to be sold based on these requests. In an allocation system, companies and individuals will often transact directly with the central bank, and commercial banks may usually buy foreign exchange only for their clients’ under- lying international transactions. Purchases of foreign exchange for the banks’ own purposes, which are sometimes referred to as “speculative,” are typically not permitted. Auction market Auctions are frequently conducted by central banks to supply or purchase foreign exchange in the market.18 The auction is often the main source of foreign exchange in the economy as a result of a general surrender requirement or the structure of inflows. The characteristics of auctions vary significantly across countries. The authorities may opt for a multiple-price auction (all accepted bidders pay the price they offered) or a single-price auction (all bidders pay the same price, which is 18Kovanen, Arto, 1994, “Foreign Exchange Auctions and Fixing: A Review of Performance,” IMF Working Paper 94/119. xxxviii ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INTRODUCTION usually the market-clearing price).19 The authorities may exercise discretion in accepting or reject- ing offers, and often a floor price is determined in advance, below which offers are not accepted. Auctions may be the predominant form of the market, or they may supplement a well-function- ing interbank market. Some countries use auctions to manage their foreign exchange reserves, for example, by buying or selling foreign exchange in predetermined quantities at regular intervals. When auctions are conducted in a transparent manner, they increase the predictability of foreign exchange flows and can thus help reduce volatility in a shallow market. The frequency of auctions depends mainly on the amount or availability of foreign exchange to be auctioned and on the role the auction plays in the foreign exchange market. In pure auction markets, the frequency of auctions may have a discernible effect on the volatility of the exchange rate. A major drawback of auctions is their susceptibility to collusion by market participants. Fixing Fixing sessions are often organized at the early stages of market development, when the interbank market is shallow and segmented. To enhance interbank market development, and to facilitate interbank transactions and market-based determination of the exchange rate, central banks may conduct fixing sessions. These sessions help commercial banks to gain experience with exchange rate determination, while the central bank continues to monitor the market closely. In a fixing arrangement, trading takes place in fixing sessions managed by the central bank. Often, central banks actively participate in price formation by selling or buying during the session to achieve a certain exchange rate target. Typically, a fixing session is based on the submission of bids and offers before the opening of the session. The organizer determines the opening rate based on the buying and selling orders. During the fixing session, live quotes are received, which move the exchange rate up and down, reflecting the disequilibrium of demand and supply. Finally, a market-clearing rate is established as a midpoint rate; the buying and selling rates are then deter- mined by applying the specified margins. Outside of the fixing sessions, banks may usually trade at freely determined prices. Interbank market The continuously operating interbank market is generally considered the most developed form of foreign exchange market. The interbank market ideally operates with minimal central bank partici- pation. However, at the early stages of development, the central bank may need to play the role of a market maker to build up confidence in the market. A market maker is required to provide continu- ous two-way quotes for a specified amount of foreign exchange to other market participants, thus ensuring that a certain level of liquidity is always available in the market. Sometimes, the central bank sets minimum criteria for market-making performance and encourages this activity by ensur- ing that only market makers participate in central bank market operations. As soon as the number of market makers is sufficient to ensure the continuous operation of the market, central banks can and usually do withdraw from this form of participation in the interbank market. Developed interbank markets are self-governing institutions and have their own code of conduct. In the past, many interbank markets also operated with voice brokers, who intermediated among mar- ket participants by matching foreign exchange supply and demand. Voice brokers may offer firm two- way quotes based on the orders they receive. However, they do not take positions themselves. Most interbank markets these days use electronic brokering systems that match purchase and sale orders electronically. Because foreign exchange trading involves credit to counterparties in the transactions, dealers must open bilateral credit lines with each other before participating in the electronic brokering system. The system automatically ensures that bids and offers are matched only up to the amount of the approved credit line. 19Multiple-price auctions may give rise to a multiple currency practice if the spread between the exchange rates at which foreign exchange is sold to the winning bidders is more than 2%. xxxix ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Compilation Guide Following a standardized approach, the description of each system is broken down into similar categories, and the coverage for each country includes a final section that lists chronologically the significant changes during 2007 and, in the case of some countries, those that occurred through end- July 2008. The Compilation Guide provides the definitions and methodology used to bring together information under each heading. The report is presented in a tabular format that enhances transparency and uniformity of treatment of information across countries and includes coverage on the regulatory framework. The information serves to update the exchange arrangements and exchange restrictions database maintained by IMF staff.1 The country chapters present an abstract of the relevant information that is available to the IMF. Article VIII Article XIV Status Under IMF Ar ticles of Agreement The member country has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement. The member country continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, Section 2. Exchange Measures Restrictions and/or multiple currency practices Exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices maintained by a member country under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, or under Article XIV, Section 2, of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, as speci- fied in the latest IMF staff reports issued as of December 31, 2006. Exchange measures imposed for security reasons Exchange measures on payments and transfers in connection with international transactions imposed by member countries for reasons of national or international security. In accordance with IMF Security restrictions on current international payments and transfers Executive Board Decision on the basis of IMF Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51), No. 144-(52/51) which establishes the obligation of members to notify the IMF before imposing such restrictions, or, if circumstances preclude advance notification, as promptly as possible. Other security restrictions References to legal instruments and hyperlinks Other restrictions imposed for security reasons (e.g., in accordance with UN or EU regulations) but not notified to the IMF under Board Decision 144-(52/51). Specific references to the underlying legal materials and hyperlinks to the legal texts. The category is included at the end of each section. Currency The official legal tender of the country. Exchange Arrangement Other legal tender The existence of another currency that is officially allowed to be used in the country. Exchange rate structure If there is one exchange rate, the system is called unitary; if there is more than one exchange rate that may be used simultaneously for different purposes and/or by different entities, and these exchange 1The exchange arrangements and exchange restrictions database includes all measures in this report. xl ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution COMPILATION GUIDE rates give rise to multiple currency practices or differing rates for current and capital transactions, the system is called dual or multiple. Different effective exchange rates resulting from exchange taxes or subsidies, excessive exchange rate spreads between buying and sell- ing rates, bilateral payments agreements, and broken cross rates are not included in this category. Classification Describes and classifies the de jure and the de facto exchange rate arrangements. De facto IMF staff classifies the de facto exchange rate arrangements accord- ing to the categories below. As the de facto methodology for clas- sification of exchange rate regimes is based on a backward-looking approach that relies on past exchange rate movement and historical data, some countries are reclassified retroactively to a date when the behavior of the exchange rates changed and matched the criteria for reclassification to the appropriate category. For these countries, if the retroactive date of reclassification is prior to the period covered in this report, then the effective date of change to be entered in the country chapter and the changes section is deemed to be the first day of the year in which the decision of reclassification took place. De jure The description (as required by Paragraph 16 of Decision No. 13919- (07/51), the 2007 Surveillance Decision) and effective dates of the de jure exchange rate arrangements are provided by the authorities. The description includes officially announced or estimated parameters of the exchange arrangement (e.g., parity, bands, weights, rate of crawl, and other indicators used to manage the exchange rate). It also pro- vides information on the computation of the exchange rate and the use of the official exchange rate. Whenever possible, country authori- ties are also requested to identify which of the existing categories of exchange rate arrangement below most closely corresponds to the de jure arrangement currently in effect. The currency of another country circulates as the sole legal tender (formal dollarization). Adopting such regimes implies the complete surrender of the monetary authorities’ control over domestic monetary policy. Effective January 1, 2007, exchange rate arrangements of the countries that belong to a monetary or currency union in which the same legal tender is shared by the members of the union are classified under the arrangement governing the joint currency. The new classifica- tion is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the pre- vious classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The classification thus reflects only a definitional change, and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members. A monetary regime based on an explicit legislative commitment to exchange domestic currency for a specified foreign currency at a fixed exchange rate, combined with restrictions on the issuing author- ity to ensure the fulfillment of its legal obligation. This implies that domestic currency will be issued only against foreign exchange and that it remains fully backed by foreign assets, eliminating traditional central bank functions such as monetary control and lender-of-last- resort, and leaving little scope for discretionary monetary policy. xli xli Exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender Currency board arrangement ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution COMPILATION GUIDE Some flexibility may still be afforded, depending on the strictness of the banking rules of the currency board arrangement. Conventional pegged arrangement Pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands The country (formally or de facto) pegs its currency at a fixed rate to another currency or a basket of currencies, where the basket is formed from the currencies of major trading or financial partners and weights reflect the geographic distribution of trade, services, or capital flows. The currency composites can also be standardized, as in the case of the SDR. There is no commitment to irrevocably keep the parity. The exchange rate may fluctuate within narrow margins of less than ±1% around a central rate—or the maximum and minimum value of the exchange rate may remain within a narrow margin of 2%—for at least three months. The monetary authority stands ready to maintain the fixed parity through direct intervention (i.e., via sale or purchase of foreign exchange in the market) or indirect intervention (e.g., via aggressive use of interest rate policy, imposition of foreign exchange regulations, exercise of moral suasion that constrains foreign exchange activity, or intervention by other public institutions). The flexibility of monetary policy, though limited, is greater than in the case of exchange arrangements with no separate legal tender and currency boards because traditional central banking functions are still possible, and the monetary authority can adjust the level of the exchange rate, although relatively infrequently. The value of the currency is maintained within certain margins of fluctuation of at least ±1% around a fixed central rate, or the margin between the maximum and minimum value of the exchange rate exceeds 2%. It also includes arrangements of countries in the ERM of the European Monetary System (EMS), which was replaced with the ERM II on January 1, 1999. There is a limited degree of monetary policy discretion, depending on the width of the band. The currency is adjusted periodically in small amounts at a fixed rate or in response to changes in selective quantitative indicators, such as past inflation differentials vis-à-vis major trading partners or dif- ferentials between the inflation target and expected inflation in major trading partners. The rate of crawl can be set to generate inflation- adjusted changes in the exchange rate (backward looking) or set at a predetermined fixed rate and/or below the projected inflation differ- entials (forward looking). Maintaining a crawling peg imposes con- straints on monetary policy in a manner similar to a fixed peg system. The currency is maintained within certain fluctuation margins of at least ±1% around a central rate—or the margin between the maxi- mum and minimum value of the exchange rate exceeds 2%—and the central rate or margin is adjusted periodically at a fixed rate or in response to changes in selective quantitative indicators. The degree of exchange rate flexibility is a function of the width of the band. Bands either are symmetric around a crawling central parity or widen gradu- ally with an asymmetric choice of the crawl of upper and lower bands (in the latter case, there may be no predetermined central rate). The commitment to maintain the exchange rate within the band imposes constraints on monetary policy, with the degree of policy indepen- dence being a function of the width of the band. Managed floating with no The monetary authority attempts to influence the exchange rate with- predetermined path for the out having a specific exchange rate path or target. Indicators for exchange rate managing the rate are broadly judgmental (e.g., balance of payments position, international reserves, parallel market developments), Crawling peg Crawling band xlii ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution COMPILATION GUIDE Independently floating Exchange tax and adjustments may not be automatic. Intervention may be direct or indirect. The exchange rate is market determined, with any official foreign exchange market intervention aimed at moderating the rate of change and preventing undue fluctuations in the exchange rate, rather than establishing a level for it. Foreign exchange transactions are subject to a special tax. Bank com- missions charged on foreign exchange transactions are not included in this category; rather, they are listed under the exchange arrange- ment classification. Exchange subsidy Foreign exchange transactions are subsidized by using separate, non- market exchange rates. Foreign exchange market The existence of a foreign exchange market. Spot exchange market 1. Operated by the central bank Institutional setting of the foreign exchange market for spot trans- actions and market participants. Existence and significance of the parallel market. The role of the central bank in providing access to foreign exchange to market participants: allocation of foreign exchange to authorized dealers or other legal and private persons, management of buy or sell auctions or fixing sessions. Price determination and frequency of cen- tral bank operations. 2. Interbank market The operation of the interbank market; interventions. Forward exchange market The existence of a forward exchange market; institutional arrange- ment and market participants. Official cover of forward Official coverage of forward operations refers to the case in which an operations official entity (the central bank or the government) assumes the exchange risk of certain foreign exchange transactions. Arrangements for Payments and Receipts Prescription of currency The official requirements affecting the selection of currency and the requirements method of settlement for transactions with other countries. When a country has payments agreements with other countries, the terms of these agreements often lead to a prescription of currency for specified categories of payments to, and receipts from, the countries concerned. This category includes information on the use of domestic currency in transactions between residents and nonresidents, both domestically and abroad; it also indicates any restrictions on the use of foreign currency among residents. Payments arrangements Bilateral payments arrangements Two countries have an agreement to prescribe specific rules for pay- ments to each other, including cases in which private parties are also obligated to use specific currencies. These agreements can be either operative or inoperative. Regional arrangements More than two parties participate in a payments agreement. Clearing agreements The official bodies of two or more countries agree to offset with some regularity the balances that arise from payments to each other as a result of the exchange of goods, services, or—less often—capital. xliii ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution COMPILATION GUIDE Payments arrears Barter agreements and open accounts The official bodies of two or more countries agree to offset exports of goods and services to one country with imports of goods and ser- vices from the same country, without payment. Administration of control The authorities’ division of responsibility for monitoring policy, administering exchange controls, and determining the extent of del- egation of powers to outside agencies (banks are often authorized to effect foreign exchange transactions). Official or private residents of a member country default on their pay- ments or transfers in foreign exchange to nonresidents. This category includes only the situation in which domestic currency is available for residents to settle their debts, but they are unable to obtain for- eign exchange—for example, because of the presence of an officially announced or unofficial queuing system; it does not cover nonpay- ment by private parties owing to bankruptcy of the party concerned. Controls on trade in gold Separate rules for trading in gold domestically and with foreign (coins and/or bullion) countries. Controls on exports and Regulations governing the physical movement of means of payment imports of banknotes between countries. Where information is available, the category dis- tinguishes between separate limits for the (1) export and import of banknotes by travelers and (2) export and import of banknotes by banks and other authorized financial institutions. Resident Accounts Indicates whether resident accounts that are maintained in the national currency or in foreign currency, locally or abroad, are allowed and describes how they are treated and the facilities and limitations attached to such accounts. When there is more than one type of resi- dent account, the nature and operation of the various types of accounts are also described; for example, whether residents are allowed to open foreign exchange accounts with or without approval from the exchange control authority, whether these accounts may be held domestically or abroad, and whether the balances on accounts held by residents in domestic currency may be converted into foreign currency. Nonresident Accounts Indicates whether local nonresident accounts maintained in the national currency or in foreign currency are allowed and describes how they are treated and the facilities and limitations attached to such accounts. When there is more than one type of nonresident account, the nature and operation of the various types of accounts are also described. Accounts of nonresidents, usually in domestic currency. Regulations prohibit or limit the conversion and/or transfer of the balances of such accounts. Impor ts and Impor t Payments Describes the nature and extent of exchange and trade restrictions on imports. Information on the existence of a foreign exchange plan, that is, prior allocation of a certain amount of foreign exchange, usually on an annual basis, for the importation of specific types of goods and/or ser- vices; in some cases, also differentiating among individual importers. xliv Blocked accounts Foreign exchange budget ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution COMPILATION GUIDE Financing requirements Information on specific import-financing regulations limiting the for imports rights of residents to enter into private contracts in which the financ- ing options differ from those in the official regulations. Documentation requirements for release of foreign exchange for imports Domiciliation requirements The obligation to domicile the transactions with a specified (usually domestic) financial institution. Preshipment inspection Most often a compulsory government measure aimed at establishing the veracity of the import contract in terms of volume, quality, and price. Letters of credit Parties are obligated to use letters of credit (LCs) as a form of pay- ment for their imports. Import licenses used as exchange licenses Import licenses are used not for trade purposes but to restrict the availability of foreign exchange for legitimate trade. Import licenses and other nontariff measures Positive list Negative list Open general licenses Licenses with quotas Other nontariff measures A list of goods that may be imported. A list of goods that may not be imported. Indicates arrangements whereby certain imports or other international transactions are exempt from the restrictive application of licensing requirements. Refers to situations in which a license for the importation of a certain good is granted, but a specific limit is imposed on the amount to be imported. May include prohibitions on imports of certain goods from all countries or of all goods from a certain country. Several other nontariff measures are used by countries (e.g., phytosanitary examinations, setting of standards), but these are not covered fully in the report. Import taxes and/or tariffs A brief description of the import tax and tariff system, including taxes levied on the foreign exchange made available for imports. Taxes collected through the exchange system Indicates if any taxes apply to the exchange side of an import transaction. State import monopoly Private parties are not allowed to engage in the importation of certain products, or they are limited in their activity. Expor ts and Expor t Proceeds Describes restrictions on the use of export proceeds, as well as regu- lations on exports. Repatriation requirements The obligation of exporters to repatriate export proceeds. Surrender requirements Surrender to the central Regulations requiring the recipient of repatriated export proceeds to bank sell, sometimes at a specified exchange rate, any foreign exchange proceeds in return for local currency to the central bank. xlv ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution COMPILATION GUIDE Surrender to authorized Regulations requiring the recipient of repatriated export proceeds to dealers sell, sometimes at a specified exchange rate, any foreign exchange proceeds in return for local currency to commercial banks, or exchange dealers authorized for this purpose or on a foreign exchange market. Financing requirements Documentation requirements Export licenses Export taxes Information on specific export-financing regulations limiting the rights of residents to enter into private contracts in which the financ- ing options differ from those in the official regulations. The same categories as in the case of imports are used. Restrictions on the right of residents to export goods. These restric- tions may take the form of quotas (where a certain quantity of ship- ment abroad is allowed) or the absence of quotas (where the licenses are issued at the discretion of the foreign trade control authority). A brief description of the export tax system, including any taxes that are levied on foreign exchange earned by exporters. Payments for Invisible Transactions and Current Transfers Describes the procedures for effecting payments abroad in connec- tion with current transactions in invisibles, with reference to prior approval requirements, the existence of quantitative and indicative limits, and/or bona fide tests. Detailed information on the most com- mon categories of transactions is provided only when regulations differ for the various categories. Indicative limits establish maximum amounts up to which the purchase of foreign exchange is allowed upon declaration of the nature of the transaction, mainly for statistical pur- poses. Amounts above those limits are granted if the bona fide nature of the transaction is established by the presentation of appropriate documentation. Bona fide tests also may be applied to transactions for which quantitative limits have not been established. Includes freight and insurance (including possible regulations on non- trade-related insurance payments and transfers), unloading and stor- age costs, administrative expenses, commissions, and customs duties and fees. Includes profits and dividends, interest payments (including interest on debentures, mortgages, etc.), amortization of loans or depreciation of foreign direct investments, and payments and transfers of rent. Trade-related payments Investment-related payments Payments for travel Includes international travel for business, tourism, etc. Personal payments Includes medical expenditures abroad, study expenses abroad, pen- sions (including regulations on payments and transfers of pensions by both state and private pension providers on behalf of nonresi- dents, as well as the transfer of pensions due to residents living abroad), and family maintenance and alimony (including regula- tions on payments and transfers abroad of family maintenance and alimony by residents). Foreign workers’ wages Transfer abroad of earnings by nonresidents working in the country. Credit card use abroad Use of credit and debit cards to pay for invisible transactions. Other payments Includes subscription and membership fees, authors’ royalties, con- sulting and legal fees, etc. xlvi ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution COMPILATION GUIDE Proceeds from Invisible Transactions and Current Transfers Describes regulations governing exchange receipts derived from trans- actions in invisibles—including descriptions of any limitations on their conversion into domestic currency—and the use of those receipts. Repatriation requirements The definitions of repatriation and surrender requirements are similar to those applied to export proceeds. Surrender requirements Surrender to the central bank Surrender to authorized dealers Restrictions on use of funds Refers mainly to the limitations imposed on the use of receipts previously deposited in certain types of bank accounts. Capital Transactions Describes regulations influencing both inward and outward capital flows. The concept of controls on capital transactions is interpreted broadly. Thus, controls on capital transactions include prohibitions; need for prior approval, authorization, and notification; dual and mul- tiple exchange rates; discriminatory taxes; and reserve requirements or interest penalties imposed by the authorities that regulate the conclu- sion or execution of transactions or transfers; or the holding of assets at home by nonresidents and abroad by residents. The coverage of the regulations applies to receipts as well as to payments and to actions initiated by nonresidents and residents. In addition, because of the close association with capital transactions, information is also provided on local financial operations conducted in foreign currency, describing specific regulations in force that limit residents’ and nonresidents’ issuance of securities denominated in foreign currency or, generally, limitations on contract agreements expressed in foreign exchange. The definitions of repatriation and surrender requirements are similar to those applied to export proceeds. Repatriation requirements Surrender requirements Surrender to the central bank Surrender to authorized dealers Controls on capital and Refers to public offerings or private placements on primary markets money market or their listing on secondary markets. instruments On capital market securities Shares or other securities of a participating nature Refers to shares and other securities of a participating nature, and bonds and other securities with an original maturity of more than one year. Includes transactions involving shares and other securities of a par- ticipating nature if they are not effected for the purpose of acquiring a lasting economic interest in the management of the enterprise con- cerned. Investments for the purpose of acquiring a lasting economic interest are addressed under foreign direct investments. Refers to bonds and other securities with an original maturity of more than one year. The term “other securities” includes notes and debentures. Bonds or other debt securities xlvii ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution COMPILATION GUIDE On money market instruments Refers to securities with an original maturity of one year or less and includes short-term instruments, such as certificates of deposit and bills of exchange. The category also includes treasury bills and other short-term government paper, bankers’ acceptances, commercial paper, interbank deposits, and repurchase agreements. On collective investment securities Includes share certificates and registry entries or other evidence of investor interest in an institution for collective investment, such as mutual funds and unit and investment trusts. Controls on derivatives Refers to operations in other negotiable instruments and nonsecured and other instruments claims not covered under the above subsections. These may include operations in rights; warrants; financial options and futures; second- ary market operations in other financial claims (including sovereign loans, mortgage loans, commercial credits, negotiable instruments originating as loans, receivables, and discounted bills of trade); forward operations (including those in foreign exchange); swaps of bonds and other debt securities; credits and loans; and other swaps (e.g., interest rate, debt/equity, equity/debt, foreign currency, and swaps of any of the instruments listed above). Controls on operations in foreign exchange without any other underlying transaction (spot or forward trading on the foreign exchange markets, forward cover operations, etc.) are also included. Controls on credit operations Commercial credits Financial credits Guarantees, sureties, and financial backup facilities Controls on direct investment Covers operations directly linked with international trade transactions or with the rendering of international services. Includes credits other than commercial credits granted by all resi- dents, including banks, to nonresidents, or vice versa. Includes guarantees, sureties, and financial backup facilities provided by residents to nonresidents and vice versa. It also includes securities pledged for payment or performance of a contract—such as war- rants, performance bonds, and standby letters of credit—and financial backup facilities that are credit facilities used as a guarantee for inde- pendent financial operations. Refers to investments for the purpose of establishing lasting eco- nomic relations both abroad by residents and domestically by nonres- idents. These investments are essentially for the purpose of producing goods and services, and, in particular, investments that allow inves- tor participation in the management of the enterprise. The category includes the creation or extension of a wholly owned enterprise, subsidiary, or branch and the acquisition of full or partial ownership of a new or existing enterprise that results in effective influence over the operations of the enterprise. Controls on liquidation Refers to the transfer of principal, including the initial capital and of direct investment capital gains, of a foreign direct investment as defined above. Controls on real estate transactions Refers to the acquisition of real estate not associated with direct investment, including, for example, investments of a purely financial nature in real estate or the acquisition of real estate for personal use. Controls on personal capital transactions Covers transfers initiated on behalf of private persons and intended to benefit other private persons. It includes transactions involving prop- erty to which the promise of a return to the owner with payments of xlviii ©International Monetary Fund.

Provisions Specific to the Financial Sector Provisions specific to Describes regulations that are specific to these institutions, such as commercial banks and monetary, prudential, and foreign exchange controls. Inclusion of an other credit institutions entry in this category does not necessarily signify that the aim of the measure is to control the flow of capital. Some of these items (e.g., borrowing abroad, lending to nonresidents, purchase of locally issued securities denominated in foreign exchange, investment regulations) may be repetitions of the entries under respective categories of con- trols on capital and money market instruments, on credit operations, or on direct investments, when the same regulations apply to com- mercial banks as well as to other residents. Describes regulations on certain commercial bank balance sheet items (including capital) and on limits covering commercial banks’ positions in foreign currencies (including gold). Describes controls specific to institutions, such as insurance compa- nies, pension funds, investment firms (including brokers, dealers, or advisory firms), and other securities firms (including collective invest- ment funds). Incorporates measures that impose limitations on the composition of the institutional investors’ foreign or foreign currency assets (reserves, accounts) and liabilities (e.g., investments in equity capital of institutional investors or borrowing from nonresidents) and/or that differentiate between residents and nonresidents. Examples of such controls are restrictions on investments because of rules regarding the technical, mathematical, security, or mandatory reserves; solvency mar- gins; premium reserve stocks; or guarantee funds of nonbank financial institutions. Inclusion of an entry in this category does not necessarily signify that the aim of the measure is to control the flow of capital.

(Country Report No. 07/252) No. n.a. Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan is the afghani. Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB), the central bank, reports a daily official afghani- dollar rate based on the average early morning rates in the free market of a sample of money changers. The de jure exchange rate regime is managed floating. The exchange rate was stable from February 2006 to end-December 2007; it experienced some volatility during January–February 2008. In the absence of alternative monetary policy instruments, the DAB intervenes regularly in the foreign exchange market in the form of twice- weekly foreign exchange auctions. The primary goal of these auctions is to control the growth of currency in circulation. Subject to meeting this goal, the DAB also seeks to minimize intra-auction volatility of the exchange rate. No. No. n.a. DAB conducts twice-weekly foreign exchange auctions. The auctions are conducted on a first-price sealed-bid basis. n.a. There are no restrictions on interbank transactions.

The exchange rate regime is independently floating; the exchange rate of the lek is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Bank of Albania (BOA) normally is not active in this market; intervention is limited to the following situations: (1) Severe and adverse movements in the exchange rate of the lek, which are cases of excess volatility in the domestic foreign exchange market; such situations are considered on a case-by-case basis by the Committee for Implementation of Monetary Policy, which aims to avoid intervention in the foreign exchange market. However, the seasonal increases in the supply of foreign currency in the summer months and in December, when Albanian emigrants spend holidays in Albania, and the lack of depth in the foreign exchange market, may result in fast appreciation over a short period, i.e., of more than 1% a day, lasting a maximum of two weeks, which may disrupt activity in the domestic foreign exchange market. The bid-ask spreads may widen up to 1%, and at times banks do not deal at all with each other. Interventions in these cases aim to restore calm to a disorderly market. (2) Considerable exchange rate misalignment with fundamentals: the lek is considered misaligned with fundamentals if there is a lengthy overshooting of the exchange rate. Interventions have never occurred for this reason. (3) A need to accumulate foreign reserves to meet the net international reserves (NIR) target; the NIR target is included each year in the BOA’s monetary program and in the agreements with the IMF. 8 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ALBANIA The BOA sets the official rate of the lek against the dollar and the euro every day, based on rates quoted by the most active and prominent domestic foreign exchange market operators. Exchange rates for currencies other than the dollar and the euro are calculated on the basis of dollar cross rates observed in international foreign exchange markets. The official rate of the lek vis-à-vis the principal foreign currencies is the rate used in settling customs obligations and in revaluing the foreign exchange positions of the BOA. Participants in the domestic foreign exchange market have no legal obligation to use the official rate in their transactions; however, the BOA requires commercial banks to use the official rate in converting the foreign currency positions reported in their monthly balance sheet data.

The BNA intervenes actively in the foreign exchange market in order to sterilize foreign currency inflows in the form of taxes paid by oil companies, which led to the stability of the kwanza exchange rate. The BNA publishes a reference rate daily, which is computed as the transaction-weighted average of the day’s rates negotiated with commercial banks. Foreign exchange operations are subject to a stamp duty of 0.15%. Transactions between banking institutions or involving banknotes and traveler’s checks are exempt from this duty.

Argentina notified the IMF that it maintains restrictions in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions and EU regulations on preventing the financing of terrorism. The Central Bank of the Argentine Republic (BCRA) has instituted a system for enforcing sanctions of this type, whereby financial and exchange institutions are required, in accordance with decrees issued by the Argentine executive branch pertaining to UN Security Council resolutions on combating terrorism, to abide by the resolutions (and annexes thereto) issued by the Ministry of External Relations, International Trade, and Religious Affairs, once they are published in the Boletín Oficial. Consolidated regulations on prevention of the financing of terrorism (Communications A 4218, 4273, 4342, 4384, 4425, 4459, 4521, 4548, and 4599, and C 40646). The aforementioned provisions (in Spanish) are available at the institutional website of the BCRA (www.bcra.gov.ar) by searching for “normativa” (laws), “textos ordenados” (regulations), or “comunicaciones” (communications), as applicable. Exchange Arrangement The currency of Argentina is the Argentine peso. All foreign exchange transactions must take place in the free and unified foreign exchange market (MULC), according to Decree 260/2002, Communication A 3471. Beginning July 17, 2006, the exchange rate structure became dual because of a measure that required exporters who failed to sell their export proceeds within the prescribed period of time to sell the proceeds to the BCRA at the reference rate on the date of sale or the reference rate on the day the sale should have taken place, whichever was less favorable. This measure was suspended effective May 17, 2007. The de jure exchange rate arrangement is independently floating, and the exchange rate of the Argentine peso is determined in the MULC by the free interplay of supply and demand. The BCRA intervenes in the foreign exchange market to cover some of the public sector’s external payment needs and to build sufficient international reserves to deal with cyclical pressures caused by endogenous or exogenous factors. Although the peso depreciated beyond the limits of a 39 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ARGENTINA conventional peg in July 2007, since then it has remained within a 2% band. Reflecting the stability of the peso exchange rate owing to BCRA interventions, the de facto exchange rate arrangement of Argentina is classified as a conventional pegged arrangement. No. No. Spot transactions are carried out on the MULC and settled within 48 hours. The MULC is the only formal mechanism for foreign exchange transactions.

A minimum of 20% of the Pension and Retirement Fund administered by Nación AFJP must be invested in regional economies. The fund administrator may not, under any circumstances, invest a smaller percentage than the minimum established for this purpose. There are no regulations because the system operates on a defined contribution basis, which does not create an asset-liability mismatch.

Exchange Arrangement The currency of Armenia is the Armenian dram. Unitary. Although Armenia continues to maintain a de jure independently floating exchange rate arrangement, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. The latter classification is a result of increased Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) interventions to resist short- term overappreciation. The CBA pursues a policy of implicit inflation targeting (IT) with the objective of moving to full-fledged IT over the medium term. The refinancing interest rate is the operational target and the CBA intervenes in the foreign exchange market to smooth excessive exchange rate volatility. Excessive volatility is defined as short-term/high-frequency exchange rate movements caused by “speculative” or “trend-following” elements, rather than underlying macroeconomic fundamentals, and which impose significant costs on the Armenian economy. The official exchange rate is set as the weighted average of the buying and selling rates in the foreign exchange market and is used for accounting purposes and for those treasury operations that are connected with external debt service or create new external obligations. Foreign exchange entities use the official exchange rate for bookkeeping and revaluation purposes. No. No. Foreign exchange transactions take place in the interbank and stock exchange markets. The CBA acts mainly in the stock exchange market. 54 ©International Monetary Fund.

Foreign exchange entities carry out foreign exchange transactions by setting their own buying and selling rates for major currencies against the dram without any restrictions. Residents and nonresidents may freely negotiate forward exchange contracts for both commercial and financial transactions in all leading convertible currencies in the domestic exchange market and at major international foreign exchange markets. However, the forward exchange market in Armenia remains undeveloped, although some banks sign forward contracts in small amounts. The CBA conducts foreign exchange swaps as a short-term instrument.

Prescription of currency requirements Use of foreign exchange among residents Payments arrangements Administration of control Payments arrears Arrangements for Payments and Receipts An Australian financial services license (AFSL) is generally required for foreign exchange transactions by residents, with some exceptions. Foreign exchange contracts are specifically classified as a “financial product” under the Corporations Act 2001 (Act). Thus, in recognition of the risk associated with the settlement period, foreign currency transactions that do not involve the immediate exchange of currency fall within the definition of a financial product. Accordingly, dealing, making a market, or giving advice regarding foreign exchange contracts is regulated by the Act and requires an AFSL. However, a contract to exchange one currency (whether Australian or not) for another that is to be settled immediately by the physical delivery of notes and/ or coins in the second currency is specifically excluded from the definition of financial product. The Act, in conjunction with the Corporations Regulations 2001, contains further AFSL exemptions that specifically relate to foreign exchange contracts. Two relevant exemptions are (1) certain dealings in foreign exchange contracts as principal for the purpose of managing financial risk; and (2) overseas entities providing advice on, or making a market in, foreign exchange contracts to “professional investor” clients. Spot foreign exchange contracts are excluded from the definition of “derivative.” There are other exemptions contained in regulation 7.6.02AG of the Corporations Regulations 2001. No. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) is responsible for the licensing of all financial services providers, including foreign exchange dealers that deal in foreign currency contracts, by its administration of the AFSL regime.

Among the goods subject to control are narcotic, psychotropic, and therapeutic substances; firearms and certain weapons; certain chemicals and primary commodities; some glazed ceramic ware; rough diamonds; and various dangerous goods. These controls are maintained mainly to meet health and safety requirements; to meet certain requirements for labeling, packaging, or technical specifications; and to satisfy certain obligations arising from Australia’s participation in international commodity agreements or to meet obligations under UN Security Council sanctions regimes. Most agricultural products enter Australia duty-free; the simple average applied tariff is 1.3% and the average limit is 5%. A general tariff of 5% applies to many manufactured goods, with the following exceptions: (1) The tariff on passenger motor vehicles and certain automotive components is 10% and is scheduled to be reduced to 5% by 2010. (2) Textiles, clothing, and footwear are subject to tariffs ranging from zero to 17.5%. Under the government’s post-2005 assistance arrangement for the textile, clothing, and footwear industry, tariffs on these products will be reduced to levels of 5% and 10% by January 1, 2010, and to 5% by January 1, 2015. Tariffs for a large range of goods have been abolished. Tariff concessions are available under the Tariff Concession System for most goods subject to a tariff, when it can be substantiated that there is no domestic manufacturer of substitutable goods. There are also a variety of concessions available for specific purposes, such as to accommodate split import consignments and to encourage investment in major projects. The ANZCERTA establishes free trade in goods between Australia and New Zealand. Australia has other free trade agreements (FTAs) with Singapore, Thailand, and the United States. Under the FTAs, goods originating in Singapore are duty-free. Tariffs on goods originating from Thailand and the United States are also duty-free with certain exceptions (e.g., textiles, clothing and footwear, and passenger motor vehicles). These duty rates are being phased out over 10 years commencing January 2005. The SPARTECA provides the Forum Island countries with nonreciprocal, duty-free access to most markets in Australia and New Zealand. All goods produced in the least developed countries and Timor-Leste may be imported free of duties and quotas. No. n.a.

Remaining controls on primary products apply mainly to food and agricultural products. Rough diamonds may be exported only to countries participating in the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (an international effort to eliminate the trade in “conflict diamonds”), and each rough diamond shipment must be accompanied by a Kimberley Process Certificate issued by the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism. Kimberley Process Certificates certify that the rough diamond product is from a legitimate source and not involved in funding conflict. Export controls apply to uranium and related nuclear materials (including tantalum and mineral sands containing monazite) to ensure compliance with Australia’s nonproliferation policy obligations and safeguards regime. Restrictions also apply to certain other nuclear and related materials. Export permits for uranium and other nuclear and related materials are issued by the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism. Export permits are required from the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency for the exportation of high-activity radioactive sources. Licenses are required for exports of unprocessed wood, including wood chips. Export restrictions are also applied to certain agricultural products to ensure exporters meet the import conditions imposed by other countries. This is regulated by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, which is responsible for granting export licenses for meat, dairy products, eggs, live animals, fish, grains, and some vegetables and fruit. Export licensing requirements have been implemented at the request of industry on wine and brandy products in both bulk and bottled form, and are administered by the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. These act as a quality assurance measure to ensure that all wines exported from Australia are sound and of merchantable quality (free of obvious faults). Horticulture Australia Limited, a peak industry marketing body, administers export licensing requirements for apples, pears, dried grapes, and oranges to all export markets, and for mandarins, tangelos, grapefruit, lemons, and limes to the United States. Australia currently has three state trading enterprises (STEs), namely, AWB International Ltd (bulk wheat), the Rice Marketing Board for the State of New South Wales (rice), and the Western Australian entity, Grain Pool Pty Ltd (barley, canola, lupins in bulk shipments). AWB International Ltd is the only national body with the remaining two STEs operating at the state level. All three STEs have export powers for selected agricultural products. Australia imposes a total ban on exports of merino ewes, their genetic material, ova, and embryos to any country other than New Zealand. However, merino breeding rams purchased at designated export auctions and semen from rams included in the National Register of Semen Export Donors (administered by the Australian Association of Stud Merino Breeders) may be exported. Sales are subject to Department of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry approval and an annual quota of 800 rams, with a provision for up to 100 rams to be placed on a semen donor register. Rams designated for collection of semen for export may not be physically exported. The export restrictions do not apply to merino rams intended for slaughter; however, the exportation of these rams is subject to controls to ensure that they do not enter breeding stocks and to a legal undertaking by the exporter to ensure that these exported merino rams will be slaughtered. There is no restriction on the exportation of merino rams or reproductive material to New Zealand.

Exchange Arrangement The currency of The Bahamas is the Bahamian dollar. Commemorative gold coins in denominations of B$10, B$20, B$50, B$100, B$150, B$200, B$250, B$1,000, and B$2,500 and silver coins denominated B$10 and B$25 are legal tender but do not circulate. The U.S. dollar circulates concurrently with the Bahamian dollar. In addition to the official exchange market, there is a market in which investment currency may be negotiated among residents through the Central Bank of The Bahamas (CBB). The use of investment currency is prescribed for the purchase of foreign currency securities from nonresidents and direct investments outside The Bahamas. The current premium bid and offer rates are 12.5% and 10%, respectively. The premium on approved purchases of securities and foreign real estate may be 12.5%. In certain circumstances, the CBB may permit residents to retain and use foreign currency from other sources to make outward investments. Certain external investments (including investment in foreign stocks by company- based retirement funds) may be effected at the official exchange rate without paying the investment currency premium. The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The Bahamian dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at par. Buying and selling rates for the pound sterling are also officially quoted, with the buying rate based on the rate in the New York market; the selling rate is 0.5% above the buying rate. The Central Bank of The Bahamas (CBB) deals only with commercial banks. For transactions with the public, commercial banks are authorized to charge a commission of 0.50% buying and 0.75% selling per US$1, and 0.50% buying or selling per £1. A stamp tax of 1.5% is applied to all outward remittances. 91 ©International Monetary Fund.

Residents returning from abroad may bring in any amount of foreign currency and may maintain a resident foreign currency deposit account (RFCD) with the foreign exchange brought in. However, proceeds of exports of goods and services from Bangladesh or commissions arising from business deals in Bangladesh may not be credited to such accounts. Balances in these accounts are freely transferable abroad and may be used for travel in the usual manner. These accounts may be opened in dollars, euros, pounds sterling, and yen. Foreign currency accounts may also be opened (1) by local and joint-venture contracting firms executing projects financed by a foreign donor or international agency; (2) by returning nonresident Bangladeshis who did not open or maintain a foreign currency deposit account while abroad with foreign exchange brought in from abroad within six months of the date of their return to take up permanent residence in Bangladesh; (3) in the name of diplomatic missions in Bangladesh and their expatriate personnel, the UN and its agencies, and diplomatic bonded warehouses (duty-free shops); and (4) in the name of resident Bangladesh nationals working for foreign or international organizations in Bangladesh, if their salaries are paid in foreign currency. Exporters may deposit a certain percentage of the repatriated export proceeds in Exporters’ Retention Quota accounts. Residents who opened an account abroad when residing abroad may retain it after returning to Bangladesh.

Nonresident Accounts Bangladesh nationals residing abroad; foreign nationals, companies, and firms registered or incorporated abroad; banks and other financial institutions, including institutional investors; officers and staff of Bangladesh missions, government institutions, autonomous bodies, and commercial banks posted abroad or transferred to international or regional agencies may open and maintain during their assignment abroad nonresident foreign currency deposit accounts that bear interest and are denominated in dollars, euros, pounds sterling, or yen. These accounts may be credited in initial minimum amounts equivalent to $1,000 ($25,000 for foreigners) with remittances in convertible currencies and transfers from existing foreign currency deposit accounts maintained by Bangladesh nationals abroad. The accounts earn interest if their terms range from one month to one year. The balance, including interest earned, may be transferred in foreign exchange by the account holder to any country or to any foreign currency deposit account maintained by Bangladesh nationals abroad. The balances in the accounts, which are freely convertible into taka, must be reported monthly by banks to the BB. The accounts may be maintained as long as the account holders desire. Nonresident Bangladesh nationals who did not open or maintain a foreign currency deposit account while abroad may open an RFCD with foreign exchange brought in from abroad within six months of the date of their return to take up permanent residence in Bangladesh. All nonresident accounts are regarded for exchange control purposes as accounts related to the country in which the account holder is a permanent resident. (The accounts of the UN and its agencies are treated as resident accounts.) Foreign missions and embassies and their expatriate personnel, foreign airline and shipping companies, and international nonprofit organizations in Bangladesh may open interest-bearing convertible taka accounts, but the interest earned may be disbursed in local currency only. Taka accounts of individuals, firms, or companies residing outside Bangladesh are designated as nonresident accounts. For portfolio investments in Bangladesh through the stock exchange, a nonresident may open a nonresident investor’s taka account (NITA) with any AD with foreign exchange remitted from abroad through normal banking channels or through transfer of funds from a foreign currency account. The balance in the NITA may be used freely to buy Bangladesh shares and other securities. These balances are also freely transferable to foreign currency accounts opened in the names of (1) Bangladesh nationals residing abroad and Bangladesh nationals working and earning abroad, including self-employed Bangladesh migrants residing abroad; (2) foreign nationals residing abroad or in Bangladesh; (3) foreign firms registered abroad and operating in Bangladesh or abroad; and (4) foreign missions and their expatriate employees. Balances in these accounts are remittable abroad in equivalent foreign exchange.

However, advance payments of up to the equivalent of $2,500 for imports of books, journals, or lifesaving medicines do not require a repayment guarantee. ADs have been instructed to observe the following procedures to avoid irregularities during importation through land ports: (1) Only one port of entry (land port) is to be named in the LC. (2) A copy of the LC and subsequent amendments, if any, including other relevant information, is to be sent to the land port authority. (3) Specimen signatures of the officials working at the import-export desks of the ADs concerned, along with their contact phone and fax numbers, are to be supplied to all land ports. (4) A list regarding entry of goods into Bangladesh, a certified invoice, and a bill of entry evidencing entry of goods into Bangladesh are to be collected directly from the land ports involved by ADs’ agents or representatives with the purpose of creating and maintaining a database accessible by all ADs. (5) LCs must not contain any reimbursement or debit authority; rather, they should stipulate the following payment terms: “on receipt of documents complying with credit terms, we shall effect payment as per instructions of negotiating bank or collecting bank.” (6) LCs covering more than $5,000 or its equivalent should be sent through the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) system to the advising bank. Yes. All imports require inspection, with a few exceptions. Payment against imports is generally permissible only under irrevocable LCs. However, a consignment of perishable food items not exceeding $7,500 or its equivalent in value does not require an LC. Capital machinery and industrial raw materials may also be imported without LCs and without limit on value. Recognized export-oriented units operating under the bonded warehouse system may import up to four months’ requirements of their raw and packing materials by establishing import LCs without reference to an export LC. They may also effect such imports by opening back-to-back LCs (either on a sight basis under the Export Development Fund, or for up to 180 days on a usance basis) against export LCs received by them. ADs may establish LCs on an f.o.b. basis without the approval of the BB, subject to certain conditions. Foreign exchange for authorized imports is provided automatically by ADs when payments are due. LC authorization forms are issued by ADs and do not require a separate import license. ADs are not permitted to open new LCs for importers who have failed to submit within the stipulated time period the bills of entry of imports or customs-certified invoices as evidence of actual importation of such goods. 112 ©International Monetary Fund.

Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange rate arrangement of the EMU countries has been reclassified to the category independently floating from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members. 146 ©International Monetary Fund.

Travelers entering or leaving the EU and carrying more than €10,000 are required to make a declaration to the relevant authorities of the member country through which the traveler is entering or leaving the EU. The authorities must keep a record of such information and report it to their national financial intelligence unit.

In order to check compliance with the regulation, the national authorities have the right to search natural persons, their baggage, and their means of transportation. In the event of failure to comply with the declaration obligation, cash may be confiscated. The EC regulation requires member countries to impose penalties for failure to comply with the declaration obligation.

No. n.a. Exchange Arrangement The currency of Bolivia is the boliviano. The dollar may be used in financial transactions. Unitary. The de jure exchange rate arrangement of Bolivia has been a crawling peg regime for more than two decades, characterized by small fluctuations for which no prior notice is given. The official selling rate is determined by the Central Bank of Bolivia (CBB) as the floor price on the foreign exchange auctions (“bolsín”). In setting the exchange rate, the CBB aims to ensure a rate consistent with moderate inflation and to mitigate external and internal inflation pressures, given the country’s dollarized economy, in which the price of the dollar is still used as a benchmark for the price of nontradable goods. Against the backdrop of a strong external position, the CBB reversed the crawl of the exchange rate in July 2005 and has been appreciating the exchange rate at a modest pace. After a period of stability, during which the arrangement was classified as a conventional peg, the boliviano appreciated more steadily starting April 30, 2007. Thus, effective December 1, 2007, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from a conventional pegged arrangement to a crawling peg vis-à-vis the dollar. Effective October 1, 2007, the CBB introduced a 1% commission on all transfers of foreign exchange to the private sector, except for export transactions taking place through the CBB. Effective January 2, 2008, the CBB applies a 1% service charge on transfers from abroad to the financial system through the CBB except (1) operations through the CBB for exporters and remittances equal to or less than $1,000, and (2) operations through the financial system for diplomatic corps, cooperation agencies, and international organizations, and remittances equal to or less than $1,000. No. The spread between the buying and selling rates of the boliviano against the dollar is Bs 0.10. Although the modest widening of the CBB exchange rate spread has 182 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BOLIVIA spurred development of a private foreign exchange market, its impact remains limited. n.a. The Monetary and Exchange Policy Committee (CPMC) determines the amount of foreign exchange to be auctioned and the range of weekly variation in the floor price below which the CBB will not accept any bids. This floor price, which is expressed in dollars, is the official exchange rate. The CBB board determines the difference between the selling rate and a buying rate, which is currently Bs 0.10, based on the CPMC recommendations. The private sector may participate in the auctions (with a minimum bid of $100,000 or its equivalent) through financial institutions that have accounts with the CBB. n.a. In the present environment of a current account surplus, it is more common for the CBB to acquire foreign exchange from the financial system at the buying rate for the day, without any restriction as to the amount.

Donated food, including wheat, is exempt from the import tariff. In order to supply the domestic food market, the government (1) adopted a temporary customs duty of zero on imports of food items, including wheat, wheat flour, rice, and corn, as well as live animals and beef (effective April 1, 2007, July 2, 2007, August 15, 2007, October 1, 2007, and October 31, 2007, respectively); and (2) effective November 14, 2007, authorized the Executive Secretariat of the PL-480 Program to purchase, import, and market semimilled and wholly milled rice intended for domestic consumption.

The tax applies to all foreign currency deposits, both principal and interest (with deposits and withdrawals considered taxable events) as well as to shares in investment funds, including redemption of shares and earnings. The rate is 0.15%. The most important exemptions from this tax are (1) savings accounts of individuals, up to $2,000, (2) credits and debits to accounts with financial institutions or with the CBB held by entities governed by the Securities Market Law, and (3) redemptions and earnings of shares in investment funds with balances (in local or foreign currency) less than or equal to $2,000. There are no restrictions on capital inflows and outflows, nor on outward remittances of dividends, interest, and royalties with respect to technology transfers or under other business categories. All remittances or transfers are subject to payment of the taxes prescribed by law. When income of Bolivian origin is paid to beneficiaries abroad, the taxed net profit must be equivalent to 50% of the total amount paid or remitted. Those who pay or remit such items to beneficiaries abroad must apply a single and final withholding at the rate of 25% of the presumed taxed net profit. 185 ©International Monetary Fund.

There is an offset mechanism that reduces the additional reserve requirement in foreign currency by increments in deposits in local currency and UFVs above the level as of March 31, 2005. This difference in the reserve requirements and the offset mechanism aims to provide a greater incentive for accepting deposits in local currency.

All importers must be included in the SECEX Importer and Exporter Register; registration automatically occurs with the first transaction. Imports must be registered in the import subsystem of the Integrated Foreign Trade System (SISCOMEX/IMPORT), which allows importers, carriers, banks, and brokers to register the various stages of an import process directly through the interlinked computers of the SECEX, customs, and the CBB. Imports are grouped into the following three categories: (1) imports that do not require licenses (usually the case), (2) imports that are subject to automatic import licenses, and (3) imports that are subject to nonautomatic licenses. In general, imports are exempt from prior approval requirements. However, some imports require prior approval (i.e., an import license) from the SECEX or another government agency. This approval is promptly given to importers whenever the licensing requirements are fulfilled. As a rule, licenses are valid for 60 days, with the possibility of an extension when the delay is justified by the importer. The Secretariat of Federal Revenue issues clearance certificates for certain groups of commodities to importers with special bonded warehouses. Import licenses for a number of imports may be obtained after the commodities have been landed but before customs clearance. The importation of certain products requires approval of the Ministry of Science and Technology. For some products, the exemption from import duties may be overridden if there is a satisfactory domestic equivalent. Imports are prohibited of agrochemical products not authorized under Brazilian regulations, weapons, and certain drugs, for reasons of security, health, or morals. In addition to imports covered by the LAIA agreement, goods imported through the Manaus and Tabatinga free zones are subject to an annual quota.

Generally, controls specific to insurance companies, restrictions on investments because of rules regarding the technical or mathematical reserves, solvency margins, premium reserve stocks, guarantee funds, etc., are defined under Chapter six of the Insurance Code, where (1) Section I contains the solvency requirements for an insurer and a reinsurer; (2) Section III defines the types of assets eligible to cover technical reserves and the provisional fund of an insurer, the general rules for diversification, the currency conformity rules, and special rules for the cover of reserves for the investment funds of life insurance companies; (3) Section IV defines own funds, solvency margins, and guarantee capital; and (4) Section V provides additional solvency requirements for insurers and reinsurers belonging to an insurance or reinsurance group. (For reinsurers, the provisions went into effect December 20, 2007.) Different types of assets may cover technical reserves of insurance companies (Article 73 of the Insurance Code).

Currency matching is required when the assets in any one currency exceed 7% of the assets in the other currencies. Up to 20% of the total amount of technical reserves may be covered by assets in a currency other than the one in which they were set up, provided the total amount of assets for cover of technical reserves in all currencies is at least equal to the total amount of liabilities in all currencies. If the technical reserves were set up in leva, euros, or another currency of an EU member state, the assets for their cover may be in euros (Article 78 of the Insurance Code). Controls specific to pension funds in Bulgaria are provided in the Social Insurance Code. Chapter 14 on Assets and Investments and Chapter 25 on Investments contain the requirements for the investment of compulsory and voluntary pension funds, respectively. The mandatory reserves requirements are in Chapter 16 on Pension Reserves.

Exchange Arrangement The currency of Burkina Faso is the CFA franc. Unitary. Burkina Faso participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris foreign exchange market vis-à-vis the euro. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU countries has been reclassified to the category conventional pegged arrangement from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members. A bank commission of 0.3% applies to transfers to all countries outside the WAEMU. The proceeds of this commission must be surrendered to the treasury. In addition, banks are allowed to charge an exchange commission of up to 2% on over-the-counter exchange for euros. No. 228 ©International Monetary Fund.

Exchange control is administered jointly by the MOF and the BCEAO. Most of the authority to supervise foreign exchange transactions is delegated to authorized banks, which are required to report these operations to the MOF. The BCEAO is also authorized to collect—either directly or through banks, financial institutions, the postal administration, or judicial agents—any information necessary to compile balance of payments statistics. Customs officers monitor outflows of foreign exchange and confirm imports and exports of goods. All residents of WAEMU countries are treated as residents of Burkina Faso for the purposes of financial transactions. All foreign exchange operations with foreign countries must be effected through authorized intermediary banks, the postal administration, or the BCEAO. No supporting documents are required for transfers up to the equivalent of CFAF 300,000. Within the framework of the regional financial market, the placement and soliciting of foreign and domestic securities in Burkina Faso require RCPSFM authorization. n.a. Imports of gold require prior MOF authorization. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports by or on behalf of the treasury or the BCEAO; (2) imports of manufactured articles containing minor quantities of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles); and (3) imports by travelers of gold objects up to a combined weight of 500 grams. Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Exports of gold have been liberalized. CFA franc banknotes may be exported freely by travelers. CFA banknotes may be freely sent from authorized intermediaries to their correspondents. However, the suspension of BCEAO repurchases of exported banknotes continues. Thus, authorized intermediaries may not receive the CFA banknotes sent by their correspondents. Reexportation of foreign banknotes by nonresident travelers is permitted up to the equivalent of CFAF 500,000; reexportation of foreign banknotes above this ceiling requires documentation demonstrating either the importation of the foreign banknotes or their purchase against other means of payment registered in the name of the traveler or through the use of nonresident deposit accounts in local banks. Residents and nonresidents may bring in any amount of foreign banknotes and coins (except gold coins) of countries outside the Operations Account area. Residents bringing in foreign banknotes and foreign currency traveler’s checks exceeding the equivalent of CFAF 300,000 must declare them to customs on entry and sell them to an authorized intermediary bank within eight days.

Exchange Arrangement The currency issued within the CAEMC, which is legal tender in Cameroon and the other member countries, is the CFA franc. Unitary. Cameroon participates in a currency union with five other members of the CAEMC and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at a fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange transactions in euros between the BEAC and commercial banks are made at the same rate. Buying and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also officially posted, with quotations based on the fixed rate for the euro and the rates in the Paris exchange market for the currencies concerned. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange rate regime of the CAEMC countries has been reclassified to the category conventional pegged arrangement from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members. A commission of 0.5%, excluding VAT, is levied on all transfers to countries that are not members of the BEAC, except those made for the account of the treasury and for the expenses of students. For other transactions, commercial banks collect commissions at a rate they each set freely. Commissions are not levied on the following: (1) government exchange transactions, (2) transfers linked to import 254 ©International Monetary Fund.

Settlement with all countries other than CAEMC members must be made through correspondent banks in one of the currencies of the two parties or in any other currency accepted by the parties to the transaction. An Operations Account is maintained with the French Treasury that links all Operations Account countries. All purchases and sales of foreign currency and euros against CFA francs are ultimately settled through a debit or credit to the Operations Account. Exchange regulations of CAEMC member countries are harmonized. The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) is responsible for administering foreign exchange regulations and may delegate all or a portion of its power to the BEAC, the Banking Commission in Central Africa (COBAC), and authorized intermediaries. Authorized intermediaries are usually delegated to administer foreign transactions and are responsible for checking the validity of transactions, collecting statistics, and reporting to the monetary authorities. The tasks delegated exclude some types of transactions. The BEAC ensures exchange regulation surveillance, evaluates cover against exchange risk, studies matters for which advice may be requested when foreign exchange accounts are opened by some resident legal entities, and monitors the repatriation of export proceeds. COBAC must ensure that the authorized intermediaries comply with the specific provisions of these regulations and do not destabilize the CAEMC banking system. No. 255 ©International Monetary Fund.

Authorization is generally granted only to industrial users, including jewelers. Newly extracted gold must be reported to the MOMWRP. With the exception of manufactured articles containing a small quantity of gold, imports and exports of gold outside the CAEMC are subject to MOMWRP authorization. The national treasuries and the BEAC are exempt from such authorization. Exports of CFA francs issued by the BEAC outside the CAEMC area are prohibited. When traveling outside the CAEMC, travelers must use means of payment other than BEAC banknotes. Nevertheless, resident travelers may carry with them a maximum of CFAF 100,000 when exiting the CAEMC. Resident and nonresident travelers crossing the borders of the CAEMC must, on entry or exit, declare to customs their foreign currency, securities, and assets exceeding CFAF 1 million. When leaving the CAEMC, nonresident travelers may take with them foreign currency up to the equivalent of the amount they declared on entry. Imports of CFA francs issued by the BEAC from outside the CAEMC area are prohibited; however, resident travelers may import up to CFAF 100,000 on entry to the CAEMC.

The amounts to be transferred must correspond to those contained in the relevant import declaration. Prefinancing of up to 50% is authorized; the balance is authorized only on presentation of the relevant trade documents. For import payments not exceeding CFAF 100 million, the authorized intermediary must receive a pro forma invoice or some other kind of supporting document. When payments for imports exceed this threshold, authorized intermediaries must ensure that the transaction is properly settled and also examine the supporting documents.

Antidumping duties are imposed, taking into consideration competition policy factors as well as other economic costs. On average, import tariff rates are low. Canada’s trade-weighted average tariff rate for all products, including agricultural products, has been less than 1% since 1998, in large part as a result of duty-free access provided by the 1988 Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement. Free trade agreements with Mexico (under NAFTA) and with Chile, Israel, and Costa Rica, as well as the extension of the General Preferential Tariff and duty-free, quota-free access under the Least Developed Country Tariff, have led to further tariff reductions. The highest tariff rates are applied to a limited number of over-quota, supply-managed agricultural products (dairy products, poultry, and eggs). Canada’s other import-sensitive sectors include textiles, apparel, footwear, and ships. Certain monopolies exist at the federal level.

In the telecommunications sector, foreign ownership of voting shares of Canadian common carriers is limited to 20% direct and 33 1/3% indirect (46.7% combined direct and indirect). Facilities-based telecommunication service suppliers must be controlled by Canadians. There are no controls on foreign ownership of nonvoting shares. In addition, under provisions of the Investment Canada Act (ICA), the acquisition of a Canadian business by a non-Canadian and the establishment of a new business by a non-Canadian are both subject to notification. Under some circumstances, the investment may be reviewable. Acquisitions in one of four sensitive sectors (cultural industries, transportation services, some financial services, and uranium production) are reviewable for all direct acquisitions over $5 million and indirect investments over $50 million. These same thresholds apply for acquisitions in nonsensitive sectors, provided both the acquirer and seller of the Canadian business are not members of the WTO. Direct acquisitions in nonsensitive sectors by investors from WTO members are reviewable only if the assets of the Canadian business are greater than $281 million (this threshold is adjusted every year to reflect economic growth in Canada). Indirect acquisitions by WTO members in the nonsensitive sectors are not reviewable. A direct 268 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CANADA acquisition occurs when a non-Canadian directly acquires a Canadian business. An indirect acquisition occurs when a non-Canadian acquires a business outside of Canada and that business has a subsidiary in Canada. Decisions to allow an investment are based on “net benefit” to Canada. The factors of net benefit to Canada are set out in Section 21 of the ICA. Decisions regarding noncultural industries are made by the minister of industry. The minister of Canadian heritage makes the final decisions on cultural industries. A complete list of cultural businesses can be found in Schedule IV of the ICA. Ministers have 45 days in which to make a decision on a reviewable investment. The review period may be extended by another 30 days and beyond that only with the agreement of the investor. Effective December 7, 2007, the minister of industry issued new guidelines on how the net benefit to Canada requirement will be applied when state- owned enterprises (SOEs) acquire major investments in Canada.

The Central African Republic participates in a currency union with five other members of the CAEMC and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at a fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange transactions in euros between the BEAC and commercial banks are made at the same rate. Buying and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also officially posted, with quotations based on the fixed rate for the euro and the rates in the Paris exchange market for the currencies concerned. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange rate regime of the CAEMC countries has been reclassified to the category conventional pegged arrangement from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members.

Settlement with all countries other than CAEMC members must be made through correspondent banks in one of the currencies of the two parties or in any other currency accepted by the parties to the transaction. An Operations Account is maintained with the French Treasury that links Operations Account countries. All purchases and sales of foreign currency and euros against CFA francs are ultimately settled through a debit or credit to the Operations Account. Exchange regulations of member countries in the CAEMC are harmonized. The Ministry of Finance and Budget (MOFB) is responsible for administering foreign exchange regulations and may delegate all or a portion of its power to the BEAC, the Banking Commission in Central Africa (COBAC), and authorized intermediaries. Authorized intermediaries are usually delegated to administer foreign transactions and are responsible for checking the validity of transactions, collecting statistics, and reporting to the monetary authorities. The tasks delegated exclude some types of transactions. The BEAC ensures exchange regulation surveillance, evaluates cover against exchange risk, studies matters for which advice may be requested when foreign exchange accounts are opened by some resident legal entities, and monitors the repatriation of export proceeds. COBAC must ensure that the authorized intermediaries comply with the specific provisions of these regulations and do not destabilize the CAEMC banking system. No. Imports and exports of gold require a license, which is seldom granted. In practice, imports and exports are made by an authorized purchasing office.

No. n.a. Exchange Arrangement The currency issued within the CAEMC, which is legal tender in Chad and the other member countries, is the CFA franc. Unitary. Chad participates in a currency union with five other members of the CAEMC and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at a fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange transactions in euros between the BEAC and commercial banks are made at the same rate. Buying and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also officially posted, with quotations based on the fixed rate for the euro and the rates in the Paris exchange market for the currencies concerned. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange rate regime of the CAEMC countries has been reclassified to the category conventional pegged arrangement from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members. All transfers and exchange operations are subject to a commission levied by the treasury.

Settlement with all countries other than CAEMC members must be made through correspondent banks in one of the currencies of the two parties or in any other currency accepted by the parties to the transaction. An Operations Account is maintained with the French Treasury that links all Operations Account countries. All purchases and sales of foreign currency and euros against CFA francs are ultimately settled through a debit or credit to the Operations Account. The exchange regulations of CAEMC member countries are harmonized. The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) is responsible for administering foreign exchange regulations and may delegate all or a portion of its power to the BEAC, the Banking Commission in Central Africa (COBAC), and authorized intermediaries. Authorized intermediaries are usually delegated to administer foreign exchange transactions and are responsible for checking the validity of transactions, collecting statistics, and reporting to the monetary authorities. The tasks delegated exclude some types of transactions. The BEAC ensures exchange regulation surveillance, evaluates cover against exchange risk, studies matters for which advice may be requested when foreign exchange accounts are opened by some resident legal entities, and monitors the repatriation of export proceeds. COBAC must ensure that the authorized intermediaries comply with the specific provisions of these regulations and do not destabilize the CAEMC banking system. No. Imports and exports of gold require authorization from both the MOF and the Directorate of Geological and Mining Research, as well as a visa from the External Finance Department.

Unitary. The exchange rate of the renminbi is determined with reference to an undisclosed basket of currencies. The method for determining the renminbi (RMB)–U.S. dollar mid-rate is as follows: the China Foreign Exchange Trading System (CFETS), before the daily interbank foreign exchange market opening quote, requests quotes from all market makers of the interbank foreign exchange market. These quoted prices are used as the calculation sample for the RMB–U.S. dollar exchange mid- rate. After eliminating the highest and lowest quotes, the CFETS calculates the weighted average of the remaining quotes, which becomes the daily RMB–U.S. dollar foreign exchange mid-rate. The weighting is calculated on the basis of indicators such as the trading volume of quoting parties in the interbank foreign exchange market and the circumstances of the quotations. The mid-rate of the RMB against the euro, yen, and Hong Kong dollar is determined by the CFETS based on the mid-rate of the RMB against the U.S. dollar at 9:00 a.m. in the international foreign exchange market. Effective May 21, 2007, the band around the daily trading price of the RMB against the U.S. dollar in the interbank foreign exchange spot market was widened from ±0.3% to ±0.5%; thus, the exchange rate of the RMB against the U.S. dollar in the spot foreign exchange market may fluctuate in a floating band of within ±0.5% of the mid-rate published on the same day by the CFETS of the RMB against the U.S. dollar. The exchange rate of the RMB against other currencies fluctuates within a floating band of ±3% of the mid-rate published on the same day of the RMB against that currency. The RMB appreciated against the U.S. dollar by 6.9% in 2007. Calculated on a cumulative basis, the RMB appreciated against the U.S. dollar by 17.92% between July 21, 2005 (when the reform of the RMB exchange rate formation mechanism was initiated), and the first quarter of 2008, with the RMB appreciating by 4.07% against the dollar in the 304 ©International Monetary Fund.

Despite the appreciation, the rate has remained within a 2% crawling band. Although market supply and demand play a role in determining the RMB exchange rate, the observed path of the exchange rate and information on intervention and reserves buildup suggest that the exchange rate is determined mainly by official action, resulting in its classification as a crawling peg. No. No. n.a. n.a. n.a. As of January 15, 2007, 22 banks had been introduced as market makers in the interbank foreign exchange market. To give market forces a greater role in determining the renminbi exchange rate, steps have been taken to liberalize and develop China’s foreign exchange markets, including the establishment of an over- the-counter spot foreign exchange market and the introduction of RMB foreign exchange forwards and swaps and currency swap derivatives. Qualified interbank foreign exchange market participants may conduct interbank RMB foreign exchange forward transactions. They may also conduct foreign exchange swap transactions six months after they receive authorization to deal in foreign exchange forward transactions and may apply to conduct RMB and foreign exchange currency swaps. For transactions with clients, the following apply: (1) All foreign exchange transactions eligible for spot settlement (purchase or sale) under the foreign exchange regulations are also eligible for forward settlement. (2) Forward settlement is subject to examination of performance. A bank may, in accordance with its own business operation and risk management guidelines, decide to execute a forward contract with a client. When the forward contract expires, the bank buys or sells the foreign exchange. (3) The principal of a forward contract must be fully settled at the agreed forward transaction price, and nondelivery forwards are not permitted. (4) If, at the expiration of a forward contract, the client breaches the contract, the matter is dealt with according to commercial principles. (5) A client may adjust the time limit of the forward contract (advance or renew the contract) by means of swaps. The contractual amount, the renewal times, and the time limit are determined through negotiations between the client and the bank.

An import quarantine approval system is applied to high-risk plants and animals and plant and animal products. There are four categories of import customs duty: the MFN tariff rate, conventional tariff rate, preferential tariff rate, and general tariff rate. The MFN tariff rate is applied to imports whose place of origin is a member of the WTO to which the MFN treatment clause is applied, imports from countries or regions that have signed bilateral trade agreements with China and that contain clauses of reciprocal MFN treatment, and imports whose place of origin is within the territory of China. The conventional tariff rate is applied to imports from countries or regions that have signed a regional trade agreement with China stipulating favorable customs duty. The preferential tariff rate is applied to imports from countries or regions that have signed a trade agreement with China that stipulates favorable customs duty rates. The general tariff rate is applied to imports from countries or regions other than those mentioned above, including imports of unclear origin. The following products are subject to a state import monopoly: wheat, corn, rice, crude oil, oil products, sugar, tobacco and tobacco products, cellulose diacetate fiber, chemical fertilizers, and cotton.

Status under IMF Articles of Agreement Restrictions and/or multiple currency practices Exchange measures imposed for security reasons References to legal instruments and hyperlinks Currency Exchange rate structure Classification Managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate Exchange tax Exchange subsidy Exchange Measures The IMF staff report for the 2007 Article IV consultation with Colombia states that, as of December 26, 2007, Colombia maintained two exchange measures subject to IMF approval under Article VIII: (1) a multiple currency practice and an exchange restriction arising from a tax on outward remittances of nonresident profits that were earned before 2007 and have been retained in the country for less than five years; and (2) an exchange restriction arising from the special regime for the hydrocarbon sector. Branches of foreign corporations are required either to surrender their export proceeds or to agree to a government limitation on their access to the foreign exchange market. While Colombia is free under the Articles to impose surrender requirements and to exempt the application of those requirements, conditioning such exemptions on the acceptance of limitations on the availability of foreign exchange for the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions is inconsistent with Article VIII, Section 2(a). (Country Report No. 08/31) Effective December 26, 2007, the tax on outward remittances was eliminated for remittances of profits earned in 2007 and beyond, in accordance with Law 1111 and applies only in respect of profits earned before 2007 and retained in the country for less than five years. No. n.a. Exchange Arrangement The currency of Colombia is the Colombian peso. Unitary. The de jure exchange rate arrangement is independently floating. All foreign exchange transactions are conducted at a market-determined exchange rate; however, the Banco de la República (BR) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to adjust the level of international reserves, limit excess volatility of the exchange rate, and influence the speed of adjustment of the nominal exchange rate. As a result, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. The BR can intervene at its discretion and via its automatic rule, which is designed to limit volatility. Under this rule, it sells (buys) foreign exchange options when the peso depreciates (appreciates) by more than 2% from its 20-day moving average. No. No. 323 ©International Monetary Fund.

The exchange restriction involves an outstanding net debit position vis-à-vis other contracting members under the inoperative regional payments agreement with the CEPGL. The MCP involves a fixed exchange rate set on a quarterly basis applying to transactions through the bilateral payments agreement with Zimbabwe.

Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the Congo franc. Unitary. The exchange rate of the Congo franc is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Central Bank of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (BCC) publishes the daily average exchange rate, which is based on the combined average of the amounts and rates applied in market transactions, as reported by exchange bureaus and banks. The BCC, while observing the international reserves target in the monetary program, intervenes to smooth exchange rate fluctuations, but not against market fundamentals.

The spread between the buying and selling rates for foreign banknotes set by the commercial banks and financial institutions in the foreign exchange market must not exceed 5%. Exchange market participants may engage in spot and/or forward operations. Forward operations are completed on contract maturity. Congo franc equivalents for exchange transactions are calculated at rates agreed to between contracting parties. They are paid on the agreed date and, at the discretion of the contracting parties, through a clearinghouse, credit to an account, or cash payment. The contractual maturity of forward operations must take account of holidays in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and abroad.

The Republic of Congo participates in a currency union with five other members of the CAEMC and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at a fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange transactions in euros between the BEAC and commercial banks are made at the same rate. Buying and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also officially posted, with quotations based on the fixed rate for the euro and the rates in the Paris exchange market for the currencies concerned. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange rate regime of the CAEMC countries has been reclassified to the category conventional pegged arrangement from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members. Payments destined to all countries are subject to a commission of 1% (exclusive of VAT), with a minimum charge of CFAF 75. Exempt from this commission are payments of the government, the Postal and Telecommunications Administration, and BEAC members; salaries of Congolese diplomats abroad; expenditures of official missions abroad; scholarships of individuals studying or training abroad; payments made on behalf of individuals for purchase of books and periodicals not intended for sale; and debt-service payments due from companies that have entered into an agreement with the Republic of Congo.

Settlement with all countries other than CAEMC members must be made through correspondent banks in one of the currencies of the two parties or in any other currency accepted by the two parties to the transaction. An Operations Account is maintained with the French Treasury that links all Operations Account countries. All purchases and sales of foreign currencies and euros against CFA francs are ultimately settled through a debit or credit to the Operations Account. Exchange regulations of CAEMC member countries are harmonized. The Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Budget (MEFB) is responsible for administering foreign exchange regulations and may delegate all or a portion of its power to the BEAC, the Banking Commission in Central Africa (COBAC), and authorized intermediaries. Authorized intermediaries are usually delegated to administer foreign exchange transactions and are responsible for checking the validity of transactions, collecting statistics, and reporting to the monetary authorities. The tasks delegated exclude some types of transactions. The BEAC ensures exchange regulation surveillance, evaluates cover against exchange risk, studies matters for which advice may be requested when foreign exchange accounts are opened by some resident legal entities, and monitors the repatriation of export proceeds. COBAC must ensure that the authorized intermediaries comply with the specific provisions of these regulations and do not destabilize the CAEMC banking system.

No. n.a. Exchange Arrangement The currency of Costa Rica is the Costa Rican colón. Unitary. Since October 17, 2006, the Banco Central de Costa Rica (BCCR) officially pursues a crawling band arrangement with an increasing but moderate width. The band is defined in terms of colones per $1 and does not include a central parity. The edges of the band are periodically adjusted whenever warranted by financial and macroeconomic conditions. The new system had an initial width of 3%, with the floor set at C 514.78 per $1 and the ceiling set at C 530.22 per $1. The floor was adjusted up by C 0.06 and the ceiling by C 0.14 every business day, resulting in an upward crawl of 2.9% and 6.7% a year, respectively. On January 31, 2007, the rate of crawl of the band’s floor was reduced by C 0.06 a day to zero and that of the ceiling by C 0.14 a day to C 0.11, allowing for a faster widening of the band and the floor for the colón was changed to C 519.16 per $1 (previously, C 514.78) and the ceiling to C 540.55 per $1 (previously, C 530.22). On November 22, 2007, the band’s floor was adjusted by 4% to C 498.39 per $1 and the ceiling to C 562.83 per $1. The crawl of the band’s floor was modified from zero to a negative daily adjustment of C 0.06, allowing for a 3% nominal annual appreciation of the colón, and the rate of crawl of the band’s ceiling was reduced to C 0.06 a business day, resulting in a change of 3% a year. These changes widened the band to 13%. However, despite changes in the parameters of the exchange rate band, the exchange rate has remained at the floor of the band, with limited variability throughout the period. In accordance with Article 97 of the Organic Law of the BCCR and Article 5 of the Regulations on Spot Market Exchange Operations, a fee is charged for participation by ADs in the foreign exchange market.

The rates must be those actually used in transactions, i.e., including any surcharge or additional cost, so that they reflect the final price negotiated by the customer. Intermediaries may trade in foreign currency in the electronic market for foreign currency operations (MONEX), in which the BCCR buys and sells currencies for its own needs and those of the nonbank public sector as well as for purposes of protecting the exchange rate band and intervention. Previously, foreign exchange transactions were carried out through the organized markets for the electronic trading of currencies (MONED). Foreign currency buying and selling transactions of the nonbank public sector are carried out directly with the BCCR or through government owned commercial banks. Public institutions may buy and sell foreign currency in amounts exceeding $100,000 or $10 million a month only through the BCCR. Transactions involving lesser amounts may be conducted through government-owned commercial banks. The exchange rates applied represent the weighted average daily rate resulting from BCCR transactions on the MONEX to meet the net requirements of the nonbank public sector, even though the BCCR may, in special circumstances, supply foreign currency from its international monetary reserves at the average wholesale market price. n.a. n.a. n.a.

Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU countries has been reclassified to the category conventional pegged arrangement from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members. A bank commission of 0.3% applies to transfers to all countries outside the WAEMU. The proceeds of this commission must be surrendered in their entirety to the treasury. In addition, banks are allowed to charge an exchange commission of up to 2% on over-the-counter exchange for euros. No. n.a. 369 ©International Monetary Fund.

Controls on the use of domestic currency For capital transactions Transactions in derivatives and other instruments Yes. Use of foreign exchange among residents Payments arrangements Regional arrangements Clearing agreements Administration of control The CFA franc is the only legal tender, and residents are not permitted to use foreign exchange for domestic transactions. An Operations Account is maintained with the French Treasury that links Operations Account countries. All purchases or sales of foreign currencies or euros against CFA francs are ultimately settled through a debit or credit to the Operations Account. A multilateral clearing agreement exists in the context of the WAMA among the countries of the WAEMU, Cape Verde, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. All payments related to current transactions between the member bank countries may be effected under the clearing arrangements. However, this excludes transactions specified by the committee of governors of the CBs of ECOWAS members and payments related to the exportation from the country of a member bank to the country of another member bank of finished products originating in countries whose CB or monetary authority is not a member of the WAMA. Exchange control is administered jointly by the Directorate of the Treasury in the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and the BCEAO. Most of the authority to supervise foreign exchange transactions is delegated to authorized banks, which are required to report these operations to the MEF. The BCEAO is also authorized to collect—either directly or through banks, financial institutions, the postal administration, or judicial agents—any information necessary to compile balance of payments statistics. Customs officers monitor outflows of foreign exchange and confirm imports and exports of goods. All residents of WAEMU countries are treated as residents of Côte d’Ivoire for the purposes of financial transactions. All 370 ©International Monetary Fund.

In addition, the exchange of BCEAO banknotes between authorized intermediaries and their correspondents outside the WAEMU is prohibited. Reexportation of foreign banknotes by nonresident travelers is permitted up to the equivalent of CFAF 500,000; reexportation of foreign banknotes above this ceiling requires documentation demonstrating either the importation of the foreign banknotes or their purchase against other means of payment registered in the name of the traveler or through the use of nonresident deposit accounts in local banks. Residents are free to import domestic currency. The exportation of BCEAO banknotes between licensed intermediary banks and their correspondent banks located outside the WAEMU is strictly prohibited.

Provisions specific to commercial banks and other credit institutions Borrowing abroad Provisions Specific to the Financial Sector The CFSSA regulations apply. An unremunerated reserve requirement of 55% (40% and 15% subcomponents) applies to increases in banks’ foreign liabilities. The net increase in sources of funds received from nonresidents or legal persons in a special relationship with a bank over their level of June 2004 is subject to an unremunerated marginal reserve requirement of 40%. Banks are required to deposit the 40% reserve requirement in an unremunerated foreign exchange account of the CNB. A second-tier marginal reserve requirement of 15% is applied to the increase in nonresidents’ funds over their level of November 2005; a third-tier marginal reserve requirement of 55% is applied to the increase in guarantees and warranties for the accounts of foreign persons, in kuna and foreign currency, serving as a basis for the foreign borrowing of domestic persons. A fourth-tier marginal reserve requirement of 55% is applied to the net increase in funds received from nonresidents that are used to provide financing in the form of syndicated loans to domestic natural and legal persons or that domestic banks extend to domestic natural and legal persons in the name and for the account of the mandator (mandated operations) over their level of May 387 ©International Monetary Fund.

An unremunerated reserve requirement of 55% applies on the net increase in liabilities arising from issued debt securities over their January 2006 level. Deposits denominated in domestic and foreign exchange are subject to a reserve requirement of 17%. The calculation period follows the calendar month. The maintenance period lasts from the second Wednesday of a month to the day preceding the second Wednesday of the following month. Kuna and foreign exchange components of the calculation are determined separately. Fifty percent of the calculated foreign reserve requirement is included in the calculated kuna reserve requirement. Seventy percent of reserve requirement is allocated to the kuna component. The percentage for allocating the foreign exchange component of the reserve requirement calculated on the basis of foreign exchange funds of nonresidents and foreign exchange funds received from legal persons in a special relationship with a bank is 100%; the percentage for allocating the remaining portion of the foreign exchange component of the reserve requirement is 60%. The remaining portion of the reserve requirement may be maintained by the average daily balances of liquid claims in the accounts. The rate of remuneration for the deposited kuna component of required reserves is 0.75%. The remuneration of the foreign exchange component is 50% of the U.S. federal funds target rate for funds allocated in dollars and 50% of the ECB minimum bid refinance rate for funds allocated in euros. Thirty-two percent of foreign exchange liabilities (minimum required amount of foreign currency claims) must be covered by short-term foreign exchange assets with a maturity of less than three months. In addition to foreign-exchange- denominated instruments, liabilities include foreign-exchange-indexed instruments (liabilities in kuna with a one- or two-way currency clause). Effective January 1, 2007, banks that expand credit above 1% each month are required to purchase nontransferable CNB bills (360-day maturity, which pay an interest rate equal to the rate on remuneration of required reserves in kuna) at a rate of 50% of the difference between actual and permissible credits. Effective February 28, 2007, the monthly limits have been replaced by an annual limit of 12% to take into account seasonality of credit growth. Effective May 1, 2007, the calculation basis was split into two parts, with separate calculations for balance- sheet and off-balance-sheet placements. In view of the credit growth of 9% recorded in the first six months of 2007, the CNB reintroduced monthly limits of 0.5% starting in July 2007, with June 30, 2007, as the basis for calculations. Effective October 1, 2007, with September 30, 2007, as the basis for calculation, the CNB requested that credit issued by all bank-affiliated companies be included in the calculation of credit growth, in an attempt to close a potential loophole. Effective January 1, 2008, banks that expand (year over year) credit above 12% from the level at end-2007 (or 1% each month, including credits issued by bank- affiliated companies) are required to purchase nontransferable CNB bills (360-day maturity), which pay 0.25% annualized interest, at a rate of 75% of the difference between actual and permissible credits. Effective February 1, 2008, credit issued by bank-affiliated companies is included in the calculation of a bank’s balance sheet.

Liquid assets in foreign currencies must equal at least 75% of deposit liabilities in foreign currencies. For deposits in local currency (euros), the liquidity positions of banks are monitored by the CBC for prudential purposes using a maturity mismatch approach. The maximum mismatch ratios allowed are (1) –10% of total deposits in the time band of “zero to seven days,” and (2) –25% in the time band of “zero to one month.” Banks may acquire assets abroad in accordance with the CBC directive establishing the framework within which banks may use the funds derived from foreign currency deposits from customers.

Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Czech Republic is the Czech koruna. Unitary. The external value of the koruna is determined by supply and demand in the interbank exchange market, in which the Czech National Bank (CNB) participates. The CNB pursues a program of daily sales of foreign exchange reserves, broadly equivalent to the amount of portfolio gains on its reserves, aimed at preventing the level of reserves from continuing to rise. Other interventions have been limited to conversion of large one-off privatization receipts, and proceeds of EU transfers. However, since 2006, no privatization revenue has been received and EU transfers represented an insignificant amount in net terms. Thus, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed, effective January 1, 2006, from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to independently floating. No. No. The CNB publishes daily rates of 29 selected currencies against the koruna for customs and accounting purposes. Commercial banks set their own exchange rates with no restrictions. 401 ©International Monetary Fund.

Equatorial Guinea participates in a currency union with five other members of the CAEMC and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at a fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange transactions in euros between the BEAC and commercial banks are made at the same rate. Buying and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also officially posted, with quotations based on the fixed rate for the euro and the rates in the Paris exchange market for the currencies concerned. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange rate regime of the CAEMC countries has been reclassified to the category conventional pegged arrangement from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members. A commission of 0.5%, excluding VAT, is levied on transfers to countries that are not members of the BEAC. This commission is not levied on transfers relating to central and local government operations, payments for imports covered by a duly issued license and domiciled with a bank, scheduled repayments on loans properly contracted abroad, travel allowances paid by the government and its agencies for official missions, and payments of insurance premiums.

An Operations Account is maintained with the French Treasury that links all Operations Account countries. All purchases and sales of foreign currency and euros against CFA francs are ultimately settled through a debit or credit to the Operations Account. Exchange regulations of CAEMC member countries are harmonized. The Ministry of Economy, Commerce, and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (MECSMSE) is responsible for administering foreign exchange regulations and may delegate all or a portion of its power to the BEAC, the Banking Commission in Central Africa (COBAC), and authorized intermediaries. Authorized intermediaries are usually delegated to administer foreign exchange transactions and are responsible for checking the validity of transactions, collecting statistics, and reporting to the monetary authorities. The tasks delegated exclude some types of transactions. The BEAC ensures exchange regulation surveillance, evaluates cover against exchange risk, studies matters for which advice may be requested when foreign exchange accounts are opened by some resident legal entities, and monitors the repatriation of export proceeds. COBAC must ensure that the authorized intermediaries comply with the specific provisions of these regulations and do not destabilize the CAEMC banking system.

The currency in which the insurer has assumed the commitment is determined as follows: (1) If an insurance contract stipulates the currency in which the insurer is required to pay the indemnity, such currency is deemed to be the currency in which the insurer has assumed the commitment. (2) If an insurance contract related to the insurance activities does not stipulate the currency in which the commitment has been assumed, the currency of the state where the insured risk is situated is deemed to be the currency in which the insurer has assumed such commitment. An insurer has the right to select a currency in which the insurance payments are to be made when such selection is justified. Such selection is justified, above all, when, after conclusion of the contract, it is likely the commitment must be paid in the same currency in which insurance payments were made and that currency is not the currency of the country where the insured risk is situated. 473 ©International Monetary Fund.

Items from CARICOM area countries that require licenses include curry products, industrial gas, furniture, and solar water heaters. Grenada applies the fourth phase of the CARICOM CET. All imports from non- CARICOM countries are subject to the following CET rates: 40% for most agricultural imports and 5% to 20% for most other items. Most imports are subject to a 5% customs service charge. Imports not exempted from customs duties are subject to a general consumption tax (GCT) regime with three broad rates of 10% and 15% for CARICOM countries and 25% for all other countries. There are three additional GCT rates of 50%, 55%, and 75% that are applied to specific items, such as new cars, foreign used cars, and cigarettes, respectively. There are environmental levies of EC$0.25 on each imported glass bottle and EC$0.50 on each plastic bottle containing liquid (including carbonated and noncarbonated beverages and syrups).

No. n.a. Exchange Arrangement The currency of Guatemala is the Guatemalan quetzal. Unitary. The de jure arrangement is independently floating. The exchange rate is determined in the foreign exchange market by supply and demand; however, the Bank of Guatemala (BOG) may intervene in the foreign exchange market to reduce volatility in the nominal exchange rate, without affecting its path. Because there is no commitment to a certain level or trajectory of the nominal exchange rate, the BOG has monetary autonomy to ensure the fundamental objective of achieving low and stable inflation. The BOG’s intervention in the exchange market is based on a specific, transparent, and comprehensible rule, which limits daily volatility and envisages more frequent intervention in the face of larger changes in the exchange rate. Due to BOG interventions the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. No. No. n.a. n.a. n.a.

Guatemala applies the CET for processed goods from CACM countries, which ranges from zero to 15%; all other intra-CACM trade is exempt from tariffs. The maximum tariff rates on raw materials and intermediate and capital goods not produced in Central America are 5% and 10%, respectively; the tariff rate on raw materials and intermediate and capital goods produced in Central America is zero. Some processed products, such as coffee, sugar, oil, wheat, and alcohol that are traded with CACM countries are subject to tariffs ranging from zero to 40%. Guatemala’s tariff structure continues to exempt certain processed products from the maximum CET rate of 15%. The tariff rate for most footwear and textiles is 14%, and rates for tires range from 5% to 15%. In addition, certain agricultural products are covered by safeguard provisions and imports of those products are subject to tariff rate quotas under WTO rules, which also allow tariffs well above the maximum rate for imports in excess of their quota. Effective January 1, 2008, imports of apples are subject to a quota of 12,500 metric tons a year (previously, 561 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GUATEMALA 11,500 metric tons), with tariffs of 12% within quota and 15% (previously 25%) in excess of quota. Yellow corn is subject to a quota of 230,000 metric tons a year (previously, 88,670 metric tons), with a tariff of zero within quota and 15% (previously 35%) in excess of quota. Rice is subject to a quota of 25,200 metric tons a year, with a tariff of zero within quota and 23.7% in excess of quota, and wheat flour is subject to a quota of 10,000 metric tons a year, with a tariff of zero within quota and 10% in excess of quota. These quotas are adjusted yearly, following discussions between the private sector and the government. A trade agreement exists among El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico, giving certain tariff benefits to the participants. There is also a trade agreement with the Dominican Republic. Under the Central America-Dominican Republic-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), duties are imposed on 6,307 items divided into different staging categories. Among those, the following categories apply to the goods traded between Guatemala and the United States: (1) Category B contains products, including chicken breasts, fish, and vegetables, that are being phased in over a five-year term and in 2008 are subject to a duty of 6% (previously 7%). (2) Category C contains 788 items whose duties will be eliminated in 10 equal annual phases, beginning January 1 of year one. (3) Category D contains products that will be phased in over a 15-year term and includes dairy products, green coffee, decaffeinated coffee, sugarcane, and alcoholic drinks; for 2008 the duties are 8%, 12%, 16%, and 32%, respectively. (4) Category F contains milk and yogurt, which must remain at base rates for years 1 through 10; they will then decrease in 10 equal annual phases and will be duty-free in year 20. (5) Duties on goods such as rum, sausages, and wheat flour, provided for in staging category N must be removed in 12 equal annual phases beginning on the date CAFTA-DR entered into force, and such goods will be duty-free effective January 1 of year 12; the duties for 2008 for rum, sausages, and wheat flour are 30%, 11.25%, and 7.5%, respectively.

Exchange Arrangement The currency of Guinea-Bissau is the CFA franc. Unitary. Guinea-Bissau participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris foreign exchange market vis-à-vis the euro. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU countries has been reclassified to the category conventional pegged arrangement from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members. A bank commission of 0.3% applies to transfers to all countries outside the WAEMU. The proceeds of this commission must be surrendered in their entirety to the treasury. In addition, banks are allowed to charge an exchange commission of up to 2% on over-the-counter exchange for euros. No. 572 ©International Monetary Fund.

Exchange Arrangement The currency of Guyana is the Guyana dollar. Unitary. The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate, and the exchange rate of the Guyana dollar is determined in the cambio market. The Bank of Guyana (BOG) periodically purchases foreign currency from cambio dealers in order to maintain international reserves at acceptable levels. The BOG conducts its transactions on the basis of the cambio exchange rate by periodically averaging quotations of the three largest dealers. In accordance with bilateral agreements with the CBs of CARICOM, the BOG quotes weekly rates for certain CARICOM currencies. Reflecting the stability of the Guyana dollar due to interventions, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. No. No. In addition to the transactions between ADs and their clients, a significant share of foreign exchange transactions takes place between the BOG and public entities with large export earnings. To reduce segmentation and facilitate price discovery, the authorities have recently moved some official transactions to the foreign exchange market.

Commemorative gold coins of HK$1,000 are legal tender, but are held mostly by collectors and seldom circulate. Unitary. The currency board system in Hong Kong SAR, adopted October 17, 1983, requires the monetary base to be backed by the reserve currency (U.S. dollar) around an exchange rate of HK$7.80 per US$1. A symmetric convertibility zone of HK$7.75 to HK$7.85—within which the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) may choose to conduct market operations consistent with currency board principles—has been used since May 18, 2005. Under the current monetary arrangement, the Hong Kong dollar spot exchange rate is fixed within a narrow band of HK$7.75–7.85 per US$1. The monetary base includes the notes and coins issued, the balance held with the HKMA of clearing accounts of banks (i.e., the aggregate balance), and the outstanding Exchange Fund bills and notes. Operating under the rule-based currency board system, the HKMA issues additional Exchange Fund paper only when there is an inflow of funds, but the size of the program is allowed to expand along with the interest payments on such paper. Issuance and redemption of certificates of indebtedness, which provide backing for banknotes issued by banks, are required to be made against U.S. dollars at the fixed exchange rate of HK$7.80 per US$1. Issuance and withdrawal of coins and government-issued notes are settled against the U.S. dollar at the same fixed rate. No. No. 602 ©International Monetary Fund.

An exemption from position limits of Hang Seng Index (HSI) and HSCEI futures and options contracts was introduced December 21, 2007.

Abroad by banks Authorized institutions incorporated in Hong Kong SAR are not permitted to (1) establish or acquire an overseas banking subsidiary without the HKMA’s approval; (2) acquire the share capital of a company worth more than 5% of the capital base of the institution at the time of acquisition without the approval of the HKMA; (3) acquire shares worth more in aggregate than 25% of the capital base of the institution (this restriction does not apply if the share capital (a) is held as security for facilities granted; (b) was acquired through an underwriting or subunderwriting contract for a period not exceeding seven days; or (c) was acquired through satisfaction of debts, in which case the share capital must be disposed of at the earliest suitable opportunity, but not later than 18 months after its acquisition); and (4) purchase or hold any interest in foreign or domestic land of an aggregate value in excess of 25% of the capital base of the institution (this restriction does not apply to (a) land that is necessary for conducting the business of the institution or 606 ©International Monetary Fund.

In addition, the aggregate holdings of (1) share capital; (2) interests in land (including land that is necessary for conducting business or providing housing or amenities for staff); and (3) the aggregate unsecured facilities to directors (or related parties) of an authorized institution incorporated in Hong Kong SAR, may not at any time exceed 80% of the institution’s capital base. No person may become a majority shareholder controller, a minority shareholder controller, or an indirect controller of an authorized institution incorporated in Hong Kong SAR without HKMA approval. Any person who becomes such a controller must notify the HKMA within 14 days. Effective July 18, 2007, a new policy requirement was introduced for the licensing of note-issuing banks. According to the requirement, the note-issuing activity is subject to a review and the license may be withdrawn if foreign governments or foreign-government-controlled entities hold 20% or more of the shares in a bank. The policy requirement is intended to prevent close association between note- issuing banks and foreign sovereign controllers, which is a unique concern because in Hong Kong SAR notes are issued by commercial banks rather than the central bank. In most other countries, foreign investment is not allowed in this activity because the issue of banknotes is the responsibility of the monetary authority. The measure does not impose any restrictions directly on any foreign sovereign investor to acquire shares, or to invest in a note-issuing bank in Hong Kong SAR, and foreign sovereign investors remain free to make such acquisitions or investments in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations. However, the additional policy requirement is imposed on the note-issuing banks as a condition attached to their authorization as a note-issuing bank. This condition affects only their issuance of notes and does not affect any of their other activities. All authorized institutions must set internal limits on their open position in each foreign currency and their aggregate open position for all foreign currencies. No regulatory foreign exchange position limits are set out by the HKMA. However, locally incorporated authorized institutions are required to provide justification to the HKMA if their aggregate open foreign exchange position limits are considered very large (i.e., higher than 25% of their capital base). Regarding foreign banks’ branches in Hong Kong SAR, the foreign exchange limits of such branches are monitored by their head offices and home supervisory authorities. However, a foreign bank’s branches in Hong Kong SAR may be required to demonstrate the effectiveness of its risk management systems if its aggregate open foreign exchange position limit is higher than 5% of the bank’s capital base. All authorized institutions are required to report their foreign exchange positions as well as exceptions on breach of relevant internal limits to the HKMA on a monthly basis. 607 ©International Monetary Fund.

The eligible assets are not limited to local securities and may be in the form of cash, bank deposits, or landed properties.

The RBI may enter into swap transactions with ADs, under which it buys or sells spot dollars and sells or buys forward dollars for maturities available in the market. Residents may enter into forward contracts with ADs to hedge against exchange risk. Outstanding forward contracts of importers and exporters booked on the basis of past performance must not exceed 100% of the eligible limit, and any amount in excess of 75%, of the eligible limit must be deliverable. The eligible limit is defined as the past three years’ average of import or export turnover or the previous year’s turnover, whichever is higher. A resident with an underlying contract may enter into a forward contract with an AD in India to hedge exposure to exchange risk for the full amount of such a contract. ADs may provide forward exchange cover to foreign institutional investors (FIIs) up to the full amount of their investments in debt instruments and equities. FIIs may hedge the entire market value of their investments in equities. ADs may enter into forward contracts with residents outside India to hedge their investments made in India after January 1, 1993, subject to verification of exposure in India. ADs may also provide forward cover not exceeding six months to foreign direct investors to hedge currency risk arising from proposed direct investments in India, after ensuring that the foreign entity involved has completed all formalities and obtained the necessary approvals (where applicable) for the investment in India. Nonresident Indians (NRIs) may enter into forward contracts with ADs to hedge dividends due to them or balances held in foreign currency nonresident (FCNR) accounts or nonresident external (NRE) accounts. NRIs are also eligible for forward cover for their portfolio investments. ADs may offer plain vanilla European forward options to customers who have genuine foreign currency exposures. All conditions applicable to booking, rolling over, and canceling forward contracts apply to options contracts. Only one hedge transaction may be booked against a particular exposure or part thereof for a given time period. Options contracts may not be used to hedge contingent or derived exposures, with the exception of exposures arising from the submission of tender bids in foreign exchange. Residents with overseas direct investments in equities and loans may hedge against exchange risk arising from such investments. ADs may provide forward cover to hedge the economic exposure of importers in the customs duty payable on imports. Effective February 8, 2007, ADs may allow FIIs to cancel and rebook forward contracts for up to 2% of the market value of their entire investment in equity and/or debt in India. The limit for calculating the eligibility for rebooking is based on the market value of the portfolio at the beginning of the financial year. Outstanding contracts must be supported by underlying exposure at all times. ADs must ensure that (1) total forward contracts outstanding do not exceed the market value of the portfolio and (2) rebooked forward contracts do not exceed 2% of the market value at the beginning of the financial year. Effective October 29, 2007, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with direct or indirect foreign exchange risk and resident individuals may book forward contracts without supplying underlying documents, or in the latter case, based on self-declaration.

For the first group, all payments for eligible current international transactions, except payments relating to travel, must be settled through the ACU. In other cases, payments may be settled in any permitted currency. Export-import transactions financed with loans from international financial institutions must be settled outside the ACU. Trade settlements are made through ACU dollar accounts, which are replenished through the RBI. Payments to countries in the second group may be made in rupees to the account of a resident of any of these countries or in any permitted currency, and receipts from these countries may be obtained in rupees from banks in any of these countries or in any permitted currency. However, special rules may apply to exports under lines of credit extended by the government of India to the governments of certain foreign countries. Controls apply to the use of domestic currency for current and capital transactions and payments. Yes. India is a member of the ACU. Although Bhutan and Nepal are members of the ACU, trade with Bhutan and Nepal is settled outside the ACU. Subject to permission from the Nepal Rastra Bank, Nepalese residents may import from India against payment in freely convertible currency, in addition to the existing system of payment in rupees; such payments must be effected through the ACU. Transactions with all other ACU members must be settled through ACU dollar accounts. Exchange management is administered by the RBI in accordance with the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) of 1999 and the general policy established by the government, in consultation with the RBI. Much of the routine work of exchange control is delegated to ADs. Import and export licenses, where necessary, are issued by the director general of foreign trade.

There is provision for the right to introduce a special permit regime for certain foreign exchange operations in the event of a threat to the economic security of Kazakhstan and the stability of its financial system. Decisions to introduce or extend the special permit regime, as well as the list of operations that may be performed only with a special permit, are determined by the president after joint consultations with the government and the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK). n.a. Exchange Arrangement The currency of Kazakhstan is the Kazakhstani tenge. Unitary. The de jure exchange rate arrangement is independently floating. The exchange rate of the tenge is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The NBK intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange market to smooth the path of the tenge exchange rate against the dollar and prevent unjustified exchange rate fluctuations. The main intervention currency is the dollar. Because the tenge has remained within a 2% band as a result of official actions, effective October 1, 2007, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to a conventional pegged arrangement. The official exchange rate of the tenge against the dollar is determined on the basis of daily quotes from the domestic currency market (the weighted average rate at 11:00 a.m. the previous day, based on trading results on the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange—KASE). The rates for other currencies are calculated on the basis of their quotes against the dollar on the global currency market. The NBK publishes daily exchange rates of certain currencies against the tenge for accounting and customs payments computation purposes.

No. Foreign exchange control is provided by the NBK, other government bodies within the scope of their authority as established by law, and foreign exchange control agents. Foreign exchange control agents are authorized banks and authorized organizations performing certain types of banking operations, as well as other organizations that have been assigned responsibility for monitoring compliance with foreign exchange legislation in the performance of their operations in accordance with licenses they have received. The NBK monitors compliance by residents and nonresidents with the requirements of foreign exchange legislation and proper performance of the functions of foreign exchange control agents by authorized banks and authorized organizations. The MOF provides for monitoring and supervision of government loans, supervision of the earmarked and efficient use of government guaranteed loans, and monitoring of government and government guaranteed debt. The Ministry of Industry and Trade issues licenses to import and export goods (work, services) and to perform other activities within the scope of its authority, and it monitors licensees’ compliance with qualification requirements and licensing regulations. The Agency for the Regulation and Supervision of the Financial Market and Financial Institutions (AFN) is responsible for licensing the organization by banks of exchange operations with foreign currency as part of a general banking license. Customs agencies (the Customs Control Committee of the MOF) exercise customs control and participate in the performance of foreign exchange control related to exports and imports.

Previously, repatriation was required within 180 days regardless of the terms of the transaction, and crediting export proceeds in foreign exchange to accounts at authorized banks after that deadline was subject to NBK licensing. The crediting of export proceeds by residents to accounts at authorized banks is not required in the following cases: (1) The foreign exchange proceeds are credited to accounts at foreign banks, and these accounts are intended to guarantee the resident’s obligations under the terms of a loan solicited from a nonresident. (2) The foreign exchange proceeds are credited to accounts at foreign banks, and these accounts are intended for the use of the resident’s overseas branches and representative offices.

Exchange Arrangement The currency of Kuwait is the Kuwaiti dinar. Unitary. The exchange rate of the dinar was previously pegged to the dollar within margins of ±3.5% around a parity rate previously set at KD 0.29963 per $1. On May 11, 2006, the dinar was revalued to KD 0.28914 per $1 (from KD 0.29205 per $1), and thus reached the upper limit of its de jure band. On May 20, 2007, the dinar was revalued again vis-à-vis the dollar, and pegged to an undisclosed basket of currencies reflecting Kuwait’s foreign trade and financial relationships, similar to the policy before January 5, 2003. By end-2007, the cumulative revaluation amounted to 5.9% vis-à-vis the dollar. As a result, effective August 1, 2007, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed to a conventional pegged arrangement to a composite from a conventional pegged arrangement to a single currency.

Thus, effective October 1, 2007, the exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate.

The open foreign currency position is limited to 10% of capital for any single foreign currency and 20% of the institution’s own funds for all foreign currencies. Between January 1, 2005, and April 1, 2007, the open position in euros was not regulated. Currency matching rules are in place. As a general rule for insurance companies, the technical provisions and the assets covering the technical provisions should be matched on a currency-by-currency basis. Insurance companies are exempt from covering technical provisions with matching assets if doing so would mean holding assets in a currency amounting to no more than 7% of the assets held in other currencies. Insurance companies are exempt from holding matching assets covering an amount not exceeding 20% of their commitments in a particular currency. The matching principle is considered to be observed if liabilities in lats are covered with assets in lats or euros. For defined-benefit private pension funds the maximum permitted currency mismatch between the pension fund’s technical provisions and assets covering these provisions is 30%. The open foreign currency position of a defined- contribution private pension fund may not exceed (1) 10% of the assets of that pension fund in a single foreign currency (excluding the euro) and (2) 20% of the assets of that pension fund in all foreign currencies (excluding the euro). Assets of the state-funded pension fund may be invested in the currency in which payments are made as a general rule; however, (1) the investments may be made in currencies other than the currency of obligation if the total amount of such investments does not exceed 30% of the assets of the state-funded pension fund, and (2) investment assets of the state-funded pension fund in a currency other than the currency of obligation may not exceed 10% of the scheme. Investments in euros are not considered investments in unmatched currencies. An investment fund may invest only in demand and time deposits, with original maturity not exceeding one year in banks licensed in the EU, the EEA, or an OECD member country. A closed-end fund may invest in real estate located and registered only in the EU, the EEA, or an OECD member country.

Luxembourg participates in a currency union with 14 other members of the EMU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange rate arrangement of the EMU countries has been reclassified to the category independently floating from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members.

(Country Report No. 07/257) No. n.a. Exchange Arrangement The currency of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is the Macedonian denar. Unitary. The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. In accordance with the Foreign Exchange Law, the denar exchange rate is determined freely on the basis of demand and supply of foreign exchange in the foreign exchange market. The National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (NBRM) participates in the foreign exchange market to achieve the goals of the monetary and foreign exchange policy. Reflecting the stability of the exchange rate as a result of official interventions, the de facto exchange rate regime is a conventional pegged arrangement. The denar exchange rate against the euro is determined by the NBRM as the weighted average of interbank transactions at the end of each business day. The official exchange rate is used for accounting purposes and balance of payments statistics. No. No. The exchange market operates at two levels: wholesale (companies, commercial banks, and the NBRM) and retail (foreign exchange bureaus and natural persons). The wholesale market is also divided into two segments: (1) transactions between companies and banks and (2) interbank market transactions. The NBRM participates in the foreign exchange market to maintain the value of the denar against the euro. Since August 2005, the NBRM has intervened in the foreign exchange market through market makers, on its own initiative, or on the initiative of the market makers.

The market makers have the exclusive right to trade with the NBRM; they also have the obligation to continuously quote bid and ask rates with a predefined spread of Mden 0.07 with each other and Mden 0.25 with other banks. Foreign exchange bureaus owned and operated by savings institutions, trade companies, sole proprietors, and other legal entities may hold foreign exchange in cash up to the specified maximum level and must keep the balances above this level in a special account with the commercial banks of their preference.

As the authorities have ceased the informal rationing of foreign exchange and there is no longer a backlog of arrears on import payments, the exchange restriction evidenced by these arrears has been eliminated. IMF staff is assessing whether the official action that gave rise to the MCP has ceased. (Country Report No. 07/147) No. n.a. Exchange Arrangement The currency of Malawi is the Malawi kwacha. There is a dual exchange rate structure as a result of an MCP in connection with the significant spread between the commercial bank exchange rate and the rates at foreign exchange bureaus. The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. Official intervention focuses on meeting the target on the net foreign reserves position and reducing exchange rate volatility and takes into account seasonal fluctuations. The exchange rate arrangement has experienced little volatility against the backdrop of direct and indirect interventions of the CB. Thus, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to a conventional pegged arrangement, effective January 1, 2006.

Unitary. Mali participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at the rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris foreign exchange market vis-à-vis the euro. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU countries has been reclassified to the category conventional pegged arrangement from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members. 868 ©International Monetary Fund.

Bank of Mexico (BOM) transactions in the foreign exchange market are limited to rule-based, nondiscretionary foreign exchange auctions to manage its foreign reserves. Every three months the BOM announces the amount of dollars it plans to auction (on a daily basis throughout a given quarter). This amount is 50% of the net increase in foreign exchange reserves in the previous quarter (net of the dollar sales via this mechanism). No. No. The Exchange Commission agreed to establish a rule-based mechanism to reduce the rate of international reserves accumulation. The BOM sells dollars directly in the foreign exchange market every day according to the following procedure: the BOM announces every quarter the total amount of dollars it will offer to the currency market each day during the subsequent four quarters. The total dollars to be sold equals 50% of the net international reserves accumulated during the previous quarter. One-fourth of the established amount is auctioned each quarter, not including the cumulative amount of dollars sold through the auction mechanism during the same period. Based on the total amount of dollars, the BOM auctions on a daily basis a fixed amount of dollars following a preestablished schedule (the daily amount to be sold is determined according to the number of business days in the current quarter). The BOM calculates this exchange rate to pay obligations in dollars in Mexico. To calculate the rate, the BOM requests that commercial banks report their interbank 905 ©International Monetary Fund.

Using the banks’ reported rates, the BOM calculates the Fix rate, which is published at noon every banking business day.

Only commercial and development banks are allowed to enter into exchange rate, stock exchange, and other derivative transactions. Authorization from the BOM is required, which is granted on the basis of certain organizational, legal, and risk- management requirements.

New licenses are issued, provided the criteria set by the MOE are satisfied. On average, import licenses are valid for a period of one year, but for some sensitive products, they are valid only for three or six months. For some products, open-ended import licenses may be granted, allowing imports to be effected during a period of six months to one year, subject to an overall limit. Depending on the importer’s performance, the license may be renewed repeatedly. No import license is required for funeral carriages and coaches, go-karts, and collectors’ vehicles (at least 30 years old); imports of other used cars are subject to MOE approval, but only special- purpose vehicles that are different from those made locally are allowed. Imports of gold and silver are allowed under OGLs. Yes. Imports of used agricultural machinery, raw materials, and intermediate products require agricultural certificates, inspection, and lab analysis. Goods covered by CITES are prohibited. Other nontariff regulations, including those related to national security concerns (weapons and ammunition); Health Department standards; ecological and environmental regulations; and restrictions on drugs, narcotic substances, nuclear energy, and toxic and hazardous materials, apply to about 1,700 of the 12,116 items of Mexico’s general import tariff. About 3,724 tariff items are subject to qualitative examination by customs to verify that goods fulfill certain Mexican consumer standards. Among Customs Act import duties, 94% range from zero to 20%, with higher rates for a few products, including fructose (210% tariff) and clothing, footwear, and leather goods (35% tariff), whereas 2,344 tariff items are totally duty-free regardless of country of origin. A 50% tariff applies to imports of new cars from countries with which no commercial agreement exists. A 7%–10% duty rate applies to 14 tariff items designated to describe special-purpose vehicles in the automobile sector. Imports from members of the LAIA, the EFTA, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, the EU, Guatemala, Honduras, Israel, Japan, Nicaragua, and Uruguay are granted preferential duty treatment. Trade with Canada and the United States takes place under the NAFTA. Mexico has applied antidumping duties to the following products: synthetic rubber and steel products from Brazil; textiles and articles of apparel, electronic products for personal use, nonelectronic toys, pencils, padlocks, bicycles, shoes, tools, iron and steel valves, and chemical products from China; beef, polyvinyl chloride, seamless steel tubes, chemical products, and apples from the United States; seamless steel tubes from Japan; polyester from Korea; steel products from the Russian Federation and Ukraine; aluminum packaging from the República Bolivariana de Venezuela; chemical products from Denmark; and frozen beef, olive oil, and furazolidone from the EU. 908 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MEXICO Tariffs do not apply to imports destined for reexportation, except those under a free trade agreement. The tariff measures are designed to support industrial competitiveness, allow imports of strategic inputs, and reduce production costs. Specific tariff items exist for statistical purposes for wines, brandy, distilled agave, footwear heels and soles, and machinery for repairing airships and aircraft parts and steel products. Reduced generalized duty rates apply to about 6,187 tariff lines related to inputs in order to reorder product chains and standardize the rates applicable to intermediate inputs. Reduced duty rates are applicable to textile inputs, which are also subject to quotas. Effective February 22, 2007, the duty rate on various aluminum products has been eliminated. Effective June 18, 2007, reduced duty rates apply to inputs and capital assets, for sectors such as fur, plastics, and general manufactured products. Effective June 30, 2007, import duties were reduced for rattan fibers, medicines and devices used in the human health sector, and some fibers and textile inputs. Units of quantity and descriptions for various tariff items have been modified. New tariff items apply in sectors using chemical products, ostrich skins, galvanized zinc, steel sockets for tools, winches, and motorcycles. Numeric codes for 3,918 tariff items have been adjusted for goods imported into the Border Region. The amendment of the Program of Sectoral Promotion (PROSEC) decree reflects changes in the Customs Act to promote competitiveness and provides for adjustments in the numerical codes of the tariff items in these programs.

Such laws specify activities for which investment is reserved for the government or Mexican investors. Thus, with the authorization of the MOE, investment trusts may be established by Mexican banks acting as trustees. These trusts issue ordinary participation certificates that may be acquired by foreign investors; the certificates grant only economic rights to their holders and do not confer voting rights in the companies whose stock is held by the trusts (such voting rights being exercisable only by the trustee). Foreign commercial entities must be authorized by the MOE before engaging in ongoing commercial activities in Mexican territory. Foreign securities publicly offered in the domestic market must be approved by the National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV).

(2) Limited-scope financial institutions may engage in derivative transactions. (3) Certain transactions are subject to a general authorization. (4) Commercial banks may engage in credit derivative transactions. (5) New underlying assets have been included. Foreigners are restricted to investing in publicly traded options when investments in the underlying assets or other securities of a participating nature of such options are reserved for Mexican residents. Financial intermediaries may enter into futures and option agreements as clients only when the financial intermediary is authorized to invest in the underlying assets. There are limits on the amounts that banks are allowed to lend to individual borrowers and on the open foreign exchange position of banks. In addition, controls apply to credits and loans denominated in foreign currency granted by an insurance company or a private pension fund.

A framework has been established at the WAEMU regional level to combat the financing of terrorism in the member countries of the union. The framework facilitates the enforcement of the decisions on the freezing of funds made by the Sanctions Committee of the UN Security Council, based on the list of individuals and entities established by that committee. Regulation 14/2002/CM/UEMOA by the WAEMU Council of Ministers of September 19, 2002; www.uemoa.int/actes/Default.htm; www.bceao.int. Exchange Arrangement The currency of Niger is the CFA franc. Unitary. Niger participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at a rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris foreign exchange market vis-à-vis the euro. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU countries has been reclassified to the category conventional pegged arrangement from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members. A commission of 0.3% applies to transfers to all countries outside the WAEMU. The proceeds of this commission must be surrendered in their entirety to the treasury. In addition, banks are allowed to charge an exchange commission of up to 2% on over-the-counter exchange for euros. No. n.a. 1030 ©International Monetary Fund.

Use of foreign exchange among residents Payments arrangements Regional arrangements Clearing agreements Administration of control The CFA franc is the only legal tender, and residents may not use foreign exchange for domestic transactions. An Operations Account is maintained with the French Treasury that links Operations Account countries. All purchases and sales of foreign currencies and euros against CFA francs are ultimately settled through a debit or credit to the Operations Account. A multilateral clearing agreement exists in the context of the WAMA among the countries of the WAEMU, Cape Verde, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. All payments related to current transactions between the member bank countries may be effected under the clearing arrangements. However, this excludes transactions specified by the committee of governors of the CBs of ECOWAS members and payments related to the exportation from a member country to another member country of finished products originating in countries whose CB or monetary authority is not a member of the WAMA. Exchange control is administered jointly by the MOF and the BCEAO. Most of the authority to supervise foreign exchange transactions is delegated to authorized banks, which are required to report these operations to the MOF. The BCEAO is also authorized to collect—either directly or through banks, financial institutions, the postal administration, or judicial agents—information necessary to compile balance of payments statistics.

In addition, the exchange of BCEAO banknotes between authorized intermediaries and their correspondents outside the WAEMU is prohibited. The reexportation of foreign banknotes by nonresident travelers is permitted up to the equivalent of CFAF 500,000; the reexportation of foreign banknotes above this ceiling requires documentation demonstrating either the importation of the foreign banknotes or their purchase against other means of payment registered in the name of the traveler or through the use of nonresident deposit accounts in local banks. Residents and nonresidents may bring in any amount of foreign banknotes and coins (except gold coins) of countries outside the Operations Account area. Residents bringing in foreign banknotes and foreign currency traveler’s checks exceeding the equivalent of CFAF 300,000 must declare them to customs on entry and sell them to an authorized intermediary bank within eight days.

There are four exchange rates: (1) the official exchange rate, which results from auctions of foreign exchange by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN); (2) the interbank market exchange rate, at which commercial banks transact among themselves using proceeds from non-oil exports and personal transfers; (3) the exchange bureau rate; and (4) the parallel market rate. The rates in the four markets have largely converged. The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The naira appreciated by 8.7% in 2007, consistent with the de jure classification. The importance of the interbank foreign exchange market has increased relative to the wholesale Dutch auction system (WDAS). This development has led to greater exchange rate flexibility. Nigeria participates in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires that the spot exchange rate between the naira and the dollar be maintained within ±15% around the central rate. The CBN has not implemented this regime. No. No. n.a. The WDAS takes place twice a week. Bids are submitted by banks through the Reuters Dealing System.

Effective December 5, 2007, the exchange rate structure has been reclassified from dual to multiple because of the existence of multiple exchange rates, including the official exchange rate, auction rate, commercial bank rates, exchange bureau rates, and parallel market rates. The official exchange rate is determined on a daily basis as 40% of commercial banks’ weighted average rate and 60% of the central bank’s rate on the previous day. The central bank rate is based on the outcome of foreign exchange auctions. Rates for certain other currencies are determined on the basis of cross rates between the dollar and the currencies concerned. The intervention currency is the dollar. Tax rates vary according to the type of transaction involved. On import-related exchange transactions, when an LC is opened, a stamp duty of 0.25% of the import value and a postage levy equivalent to $2 are payable. On foreign checks for collection, commercial banks charge a commission of $2 a transaction. For the collection of export proceeds, a commission of 0.125% (a minimum of $25 and a maximum of $300) is charged when the LC is opened, and an additional fee of 0.125% is levied when the funds are received.

Exchange Arrangement The currency of Senegal is the CFA franc. Unitary. Senegal participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at a rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market vis-à-vis the euro. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU countries has been reclassified to the category conventional pegged arrangement from the category exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members. A commission of 0.3% applies to transfers to all countries outside the WAEMU. The proceeds of this commission must be surrendered in their entirety to the treasury. In addition, banks are allowed to charge an exchange commission of up to 2% on over-the-counter exchange for euros. No. 1215 ©International Monetary Fund.

Most of the authority to supervise foreign exchange transactions is delegated to authorized banks, which are required to report these operations to the MEF. The BCEAO is also authorized to collect—either directly or through banks, financial institutions, the postal administration, or judicial agents —information necessary to compile balance of payments statistics. Customs officers monitor outflows of foreign exchange and confirm importation and exportation of goods.

As a member of the UN, Serbia observes and implements all mandatory measures of UN resolutions. n.a. Exchange Arrangement The currency of Serbia is the Serbian dinar. Unitary. The National Bank of Serbia (NBS) uses the two-week repo rate as the main monetary policy instrument to implement a monetary policy that is anchored by the announcement of core inflation objectives, anticipating eventual transition to full-fledged inflation targeting. The exchange rate regime aims to gradually converge toward free floating of the dinar. According to the 2007 Monetary Policy Program of the NBS, the NBS may intervene in the foreign exchange market to (1) limit daily volatility, but not to resist cumulative pressure over a longer period; (2) contain potential threats to financial and price stability; and (3) safeguard an adequate level of international reserves. Effective March 5, 2007, the official middle exchange rate of the dinar against the euro is set at the start of each business day as the weighted average of the exchange rates applied in all individual transactions done at the interbank spot foreign exchange market outside the fixing session and in the fixing session on the previous day. The official middle rate of the dinar against the euro is effective on the business day of calculation. No. Export incentives were abolished, except incentives for agricultural and food products. Exchange subsidies are offered only for certain agricultural and food industry exports, at rates ranging from 5% to 20%. 1226 ©International Monetary Fund.

Effective January 1, 2008, the 0.3% incentive fee paid by the NBS to foreign exchange dealers was reduced to zero. Previously, the fee was reduced from 0.7% to 0.5%, effective January 1, 2007, and from 0.5% to 0.3%, effective June 4, 2007. Furthermore, the NBS has not renewed its agreements with exchange dealers, unless they had already concluded agreements on the performance of exchange transactions with one or more commercial banks. On September 1, 2007, the NBS closed the units in charge of exchange transactions at 33 locations in Serbia and deals with licensed exchange bureaus only at five branch offices. A commission applies to sales of banknotes by the NBS to foreign exchange dealers in euros and Swiss francs (0.15%) and on sales of dollars (2%). n.a. n.a. Effective June 4, 2007, the NBS stopped organizing daily IFEM (fixing) sessions and holds such sessions only when it is necessary in order to stabilize the foreign exchange market. The NBS charges a 0.1% commission on each realized transaction for organizing the fixing session. NBS sales and purchases of foreign exchange to residents holding foreign currency accounts with the NBS take place at rates on the NBS’s exchange rate lists. The NBS sales and purchases of foreign cash to and from licensed exchange dealers take place by applying current buying and selling rates for foreign cash specified in the NBS’s foreign exchange rate list. Effective March 5, 2007, the NBS stopped conducting trade in foreign cash currencies other than the euro, dollar, and Swiss franc with banks and licensed exchange offices. Banks are free to fix their own buying and selling rates for foreign exchange on the basis of supply and demand but must observe the cross rates prevailing in the international market. Banks may buy and sell foreign exchange on the interbank market outside the fixing session when these are held at mutually agreed rates, and they may set the commissions for these services freely. With fixing sessions only when market conditions require them, the NBS started to participate in the interbank foreign exchange market, through the Reuters Dealing System, by selling specific amounts of foreign exchange originating from net purchases of the NBS from licensed exchange offices at the best quoted rate to channel the foreign exchange to the market without the intention of influencing the exchange rate. Forward purchases and sales of foreign exchange are permitted, provided their terms of delivery are other than spot dates but not more than one year from the day of concluding the purchase or sale contract. n.r.

No. n.a. Exchange Arrangement The currency of Sierra Leone is the Sierra Leonean leone. Unitary. According to the official policy, the exchange rate of the leone is determined in the interbank market. The foreign exchange auctions of the Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL) resulted in a stable exchange rate commonly used by market participants as a refrence for other foreign exchange transacations. Thus, effective December 1, 2006, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from a crawling peg to a conventional pegged arrangement. The BSL determines the exchange rate to be used in official transactions, including for customs valuation purposes, which is based on the weighted average mid-rate of purchases and sales made by commercial banks and foreign exchange bureaus during the preceding five business days and at the weekly auction. The official buying and selling rates are set within ±1% of the official mid-rate. Sierra Leone participates in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ and maintains the spot exchange rate between the leone and the dollar within margins of ±15% around the central rate of Le 2,932.52 per $1; however, the BSL has yet to implement these measures. No. No. Commercial banks and licensed foreign exchange bureaus may buy from and sell foreign exchange to customers and trade freely among them or with the BSL. Foreign exchange bureaus are limited to spot transactions and may not sell traveler’s checks. The banks’ and bureaus’ retail market represents the majority of foreign exchange transactions. n.a. The BSL operates weekly auctions. The auction is a multiple-rate auction. It is pre- announced and is open to commercial banks, foreign exchange bureaus, and 1253 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SIERRA LEONE importers of goods and services (nonbank participants must submit their bids through commercial banks). Purchases of foreign exchange in the auction can be done either through a competitive or a noncompetitive window. For the former, bids are awarded if they are higher or equal to the preannounced clearing exchange rate. Bids in the noncompetitive window are awarded at the auction rate (defined as the weighted average rate of all winning and awarded competitive bids). n.a. Commercial banks and licensed foreign exchange bureaus may trade freely among themselves or with the BSL. Forward transactions with respect to imports and exports of raw materials and goods may be undertaken with or through commercial banks by an institution dealing in the underlying imports or exports of goods.

The Slovak Republic accepted and fully implemented the EU regulations on common trade and agricultural policies on the date of its accession to the EU. The EC import licensing system is in place to manage imports of specific products subject to quantitative restrictions, safeguard measures, or import surveillance. The EC currently maintains more than 90 tariff quotas, mostly on agricultural products. These quotas are administered through import licences, and include beef, sheep, goats, chicken, turkey, milk products, eggs, potatoes, fruit and vegetables, wheat, barley, rice, maize, starch, mushrooms, sausages, sugar, and grape juice. The EU’s common licensing system applies to imports of textiles originating in five countries and steel originating in Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine. The EU imposes trade and economic sanctions in accordance with resolutions of the UN Security Council. For example, the EU prohibits direct or indirect imports of rough diamonds and round logs and timber products from Liberia, whether of Liberian origin or not. Moreover, the EU prohibits the importation of rough diamonds from Côte d’Ivoire, whether of Côte d’Ivoire origin or not. The EU also restricts trade under treaties and international conventions to which it is a signatory. The EU’s common system of monitoring imports (the system of double-checking surveillance and the system of single surveillance) applies to textiles originating in two countries and steel originating in third countries. Effective January 1, 2007, as a result of the expansion of the EU, the applicable textile and steel quantitative limits were amended by Council Regulations Nos. 54/2007, 1870/2006, 1871/2006, and 1872/2006.

On June 4, 2007, the Central Bank of Sudan (CBOS) introduced a cash margin requirement for letters of credit and import credit that constitutes an exchange restriction and multiple currency practice under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3.

As of June 4, 2007, the exchange rate structure is dual because of the introduction by the CBOS of a cash margin requirement on LCs and import credit. Previously, the exchange rate structure was unitary. On December 30, 2007, the cash margin requirement was abolished. Officially, the exchange rate is determined in the interbank market, in which participants deal directly with each other. The CBOS participates in the market through swaps under a rules-based mechanism that triggers intervention when the exchange rate exceeds a band within ±3% of the previous day’s closing rate. The main objective of the policy is to ensure the stability and flexibility of the exchange rate. In the months immediately preceding the conversion of the dinar to the Sudanese guinea, the CBOS intervened to keep the nominal rate steady relative to the dollar. Since the completion of the conversion in mid-2007, the CBOS has reverted to its earlier stance on exchange rate flexibility. Since September 2007, the nominal exchange rate has depreciated by 3.4% vis-à-vis the dollar.

Status under IMF Articles of Agreement Restrictions and/or multiple currency practices Exchange Measures The IMF staff report for the 2007 Article IV consultation with Suriname states that, as of March 6, 2007, Suriname maintained multiple currency practices subject to IMF approval. The multiple currency practices arise from the potential for the spread to exceed 2% between the official and the commercial exchange rates and from the existence of a special exchange rate for imports of baby milk.

Currency Other legal tender Exchange rate structure Multiple Classification Conventional pegged arrangement Exchange tax Exchange subsidy Exchange Arrangement The currency of Suriname is the Surinamese dollar. Eighteen commemorative gold coins are legal tender. An official exchange rate is used for about 20% of all foreign exchange transactions, and a commercial exchange rate, which is more flexible, is used by commercial banks and exchange bureaus to handle all other foreign exchange transactions. The government of Suriname provides a subsidy to imports of infant formula according to a mechanism whereby 50% of the counter value is paid by the ministry of finance (50% of the exchange rate multiplied by the foreign exchange amount). The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. According to a July 1994 presidential decree, the exchange rate is to be determined through demand and supply. Monetary and fiscal policies are geared toward exchange rate stabilization. As a result, the exchange rate of the Surinamese dollar vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar in the official and parallel markets has remained stable at around SRD 2.80 per $1 since 2003. Thus, the de facto exchange rate regime is a conventional pegged arrangement with the official exchange rate pegged at SRD 2.75 per $1. In the event of persistent discrepancy between the official rate and the rates quoted by commercial banks and nonbank institutions, the official rate will be adjusted to reflect the prevailing market conditions.

Payments arrears are owed to Brazil and the United States, with Brazil accounting for the larger part of the arrears.

Syria also maintained exchange measures that are subject to IMF approval under Article VIII: (1) prohibition against purchases by private parties of foreign exchange from the banking system for some current international transactions; (2) a multiple currency practice resulting from divergences of more than 2% between the official exchange rate and officially recognized market exchange rates; (3) a non-interest-bearing advance import deposit requirement of 75–100% for public sector imports; and (4) an exchange restriction arising from the net debt under inoperative bilateral payments arrangements with the Islamic Republic of Iran and Sri Lanka.

Currency Exchange rate structure Dual Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Syrian Arab Republic is the Syrian pound. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange rate system consists of two rates: (1) the legally designated official rate of LS 11.20/11.25 per $1, which applies to the repayment of loans and interest arising from former bilateral payments agreements, pending agreements on their rescheduling; and (2) the exchange rate for all other transactions (market exchange rate), which unified the other exchange rates. As a result, the exchange rate structure was reclassified to the category dual from the category multiple. Previously, the state and public sector “budget rate” of LS 50 per $1 constituted the second rate. This rate applied to (1) payments for public sector exports, including exports of crude oil and petroleum; (2) all public sector imports; (3) repayment of loans not related to bilateral payments agreements; (4) public sector remittances from abroad; and (5) all other public sector enterprise foreign exchange transactions. The third previous rate was the free market foreign exchange rate, set to reflect developments in the free market exchange rates offshore in Beirut and Amman and applied to foreign exchange sales by authorized banks for (1) private sector purchases of foreign exchange for noncommercial transactions, including medical, study, religious, and travel expenses; (2) the 1367 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC extension of credit to importers of raw materials needed for exports; (3) private sector exports; and (4) private sector remittances and receipts from the exportation of services. The fourth, unofficial, rate was the free market rate, which was the rate in certain cities in the region (mainly Amman and Beirut) and in Syria that applied to (1) private sector import payments not financed by banks, (2) private sector remittances and services receipts and payments, and (3) private capital flows. The free market rate was determined by private supply and demand, with market participants matching their needs through brokers or dealers in the offshore market. The pound was revalued against the dollar at end-July, 2007. Since August 2007, the official rate is pegged to the SDR with a wide margin. Thus, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed, effective September 1, 2007, to a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands from a conventional pegged arrangement.

Exchange Arrangement The currency of Tajikistan is the Tajik somoni. Unitary. The de jure exchange arrangement is managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. The exchange rate of the somoni is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, in which the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) may intervene to limit exchange rate volatility. As a result of these interventions, the somoni exchange rate was very stable during the past 18 months. Thus, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement was changed, effective January 1, 2007, from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to a conventional pegged arrangement. The official exchange rate of the somoni against the dollar is determined and set daily by the NBT on the basis of the weighted average exchange rates of dollar transactions in the interbank and intrabank foreign exchange markets as of 3:00 p.m. Exchange rates for other currencies are determined indirectly through cross- exchange rates of the dollar against these currencies. The official exchange rate is used for purposes of accounting and customs payments and does not serve as a basis for authorized banks’ exchange rate in transactions with their clients. The official exchange rate is established without any obligation on the part of the NBT to purchase or sell currency at that exchange rate. No. No. 1377 ©International Monetary Fund.

Nonresidents may enter into contracts with resident authorized intermediaries for forward purchases of convertible dinars maturing in up to 12 months. Resident authorized intermediaries may engage in, among themselves or with resident enterprises, foreign currency/convertible dinar swaps maturing in up to 12 months. They may also engage in foreign currency/convertible dinar swaps with nonresident banks operating in Tunisia, their foreign correspondent banks, and nonresident enterprises operating in Tunisia to make spot purchases and forward sales of convertible dinars. For the purpose of hedging against foreign currency interest rate risks, forward rate agreements may be signed for terms of 12 months by resident banks with foreign correspondent banks and by resident enterprises with resident banks and nonresident banks operating in Tunisia.

Law on Preventing and Combating Money Laundering. Exchange Arrangement The currency of Ukraine is the Ukrainian hryvnia. Unitary. The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. In accordance with the constitution and the Law on the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU), the main function of the NBU is to ensure stability of the domestic monetary unit. To this end, the NBU influences the exchange rate without planning a specific path or exchange rate target. Exchange rate adjustments are not automatic in nature. Interventions may be both direct and indirect. The hryvnia previously remained within a very narrow band vis-à-vis the dollar due to interventions; more recently, it has shown increased flexibility. Thus, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed, effective April 30, 2008, from a conventional pegged arrangement to managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. The NBU sets the official exchange rate of the hryvnia against the dollar on the basis of rate quotations and other indicators reflecting the dynamics of Ukraine’s interbank foreign exchange market. The official exchange rate is used by residents and nonresidents in transactions with foreign exchange and bank metals, and for the execution of transactions with the State Treasury of Ukraine. The fee on purchases of noncash foreign exchange used for government pension insurance was reduced from 1.3% to 1% on January 1, 2007. This fee was reduced further to 0.5% in the context of the 2008 budget. No. Foreign currency may be traded on the interbank foreign exchange market of Ukraine and on the international foreign exchange market only via authorized banks.

Banks that have the right to open correspondent accounts at foreign banks must purchase foreign currency in the interbank market directly and not through other Ukrainian banks. Banks may trade foreign currency at a contractual exchange rate for each transaction. Banks may conduct forward foreign exchange operations with maturities of up to one year for purposes of hedging risk with respect to foreign economic agreements on their own behalf and on behalf of their clients. Banks may transact purchases of foreign currency in Group 1 of the NBU’s Classification of Foreign Currencies and Bank Metals, provided the long (short) open foreign exchange position of the bank for such transactions is not more than 10% of the regulatory capital of the bank. Transactions with other foreign currency derivative instruments are not perrmitted in the interbank market.

Since April 2007, the sum has been depreciating vis-à-vis the dollar within a 2% crawling band, while the Central Bank of Uzbekistan’s (CBU’s) one-sided interventions have resulted in steady reserve accumulation. As a result, the exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified, effective April 1, 2007, to the category crawling peg from the category conventional pegged arrangement. Effective January 1, 2008, the official exchange rate is determined on the basis of interbank trading sessions (ITS) relative to two currencies, the dollar and the euro. The official exchange rate of the CBU is determined once a week as the average ITS rate for the previous week, and it remains in effect for one week. Exchange rates for other currencies are determined on the basis of their cross rates vis-à-vis the dollar in the international market. The margin of the official buying and selling rates vis-à-vis the official exchange rate did not exceed 0.15% in 2007. The CBU participates in ITS for the purpose of balancing supply and demand.

The Zimbabwe dollar has been redenominated using a rate of 1:1,000. Multiple. Effective May 2, 2008, a new market-determined foreign exchange pricing framework has been introduced. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) posts on Reuters the average interbank exchange rate derived from the bid/offer rates of ADs reported to the RBZ. Previously, under the Tradable Foreign Currency Balance System, the interbank exchange rate was allowed to depreciate by a daily maximum of (1) 1% if the volume transacted in the market reached US$5– US$10 million a day; (2) 1.5% if daily transaction volume reached US$10– US$15 million a day; and (3) 2% if it exceeded US$15 million a day. Under this system, volume was known only to the RBZ, and the RBZ effectively fixed the exchange rate. All foreign exchange transactions by the government are effected at the rate of Z$30,000 per US$1. The guaranteed floor exchange rate for inward remittances is the interbank rate. No. Effective May 2, 2008, the support price of Z$700 billion a kilogram on gold deliveries was eliminated. The new pricing structure is based on the previous day’s London gold afternoon fix price, calculated at the prevailing interbank exchange rate. An official rate for government imports and debt service with Afreximbank applies at Z$30 per US$1 (after redenomination). Public enterprises receive foreign exchange from the RBZ at the prevailing interbank rate. For the 2007 selling season, the new producer price of cotton was Z$500 a kilogram. The producer prices of wheat and maize were Z$49,000 a ton and Z$2,000 a ton, respectively. Effective May 2, 2008, ADs may match buyers and sellers of foreign exchange according to a predetermined list of priorities. ADs are required to submit to the RBZ the details of the transactions they handle on a biweekly basis. 1588 ©International Monetary Fund.

No person, either as principal or agent, may deal in or possess gold unless that person is (1) the holder of a license or permit, (2) the holder or distributor of a registered mining location from which gold is being produced, or (3) the employee or agent of any of the persons mentioned in (1) and (2) above and authorized by an employer or principal to deal in or possess gold that is already in the lawful possession of the employer or principal. A mining commissioner may issue to any person a permit authorizing the acquisition, possession, or disposal of any gold, provided the quantity does not exceed one troy ounce. In all other cases, permission may be issued only by the secretary for mines. Under the terms of the Gold Trade Act, three types of licenses may be issued: a gold dealing license, a gold recovery works license, and a gold assaying license. All gold obtained from a registered mining location must be lodged with the holder of its gold-dealing license no later than the tenth day of the month, unless specific permission has been granted by the mining commissioner or the appropriate minister. Any person intending to smelt gold or any article containing gold must first obtain a license issued by a district commissioner under the terms of the Secondhand Goods Act, which authorizes the possession of smelting equipment. Small-scale gold producers receive a support price of Z$16,000 a gram. There is no longer a gold support price for large-scale producers, but they may receive the support price for small-scale producers if they choose to be paid in Zimbabwe dollars. The exportation of gold in unmanufactured form is controlled and licensed by the Ministry of Mines; these controls do not apply to the RBZ. No export licenses for gold are issued. The importation of gold is controlled by the Gold Trade Act, which requires those intending to import gold into Zimbabwe to meet certain requirements. Effective May 2, 2008, the limit for export of local currency in person or baggage by resident travelers is Z$5 billion (previously, effective February 1, 2007, it was increased from Z$5,000 to Z$100,000 (new currency) and effective October 2, 2007, from Z$100,000 to Z$500 million). Residents may take out up to the equivalent of US$1,000 a day without Exchange Control approval and may take out up to the equivalent of US$600 a day for business travel and up to US$2,500 a year for holiday travel. Nonresident travelers may take out the traveler’s checks they brought in, minus the amount they sold to ADs. On departure, nonresident travelers may reconvert unspent Zimbabwean currency into foreign currency on presentation of exchange certificates. Effective May 2, 2008, the limit for the import of local currency in person or baggage by resident travelers is Z$5 billion (previously, effective October 2, 2007, it was increased from Z$100,000 to Z$500 million).

Effective May 2, 2008, ADs manage export proceeds and corporate foreign currency account (FCA) deposits. Previously, FCAs for all companies, including EPZ companies and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), were kept with the RBZ; ADs maintained mirror accounts for their exporting clients. All such deposits earn 12% annual interest in foreign currency for U.S. dollars, pounds, euros, pula, and rand. Effective October 2, 2007, exporters, including EPZ companies, may retain 65% of export proceeds in FCAs, since the portion of foreign currency received from exports of goods and services that must be sold in the foreign exchange market has been reduced to 35% from 40%. In addition, 10% of export earnings are directed toward the Fuel and Electricity Stabilization Fund (FESF). Tobacco prices are quoted in U.S. dollars at auctions; cotton and tobacco producers may retain, effective October 2, 2007, 25% (previously, 15%) of the sales in FCAs and receive the rest in the local currency equivalent at the interbank rate. In addition, producers receive a 35% early delivery bonus, which is based on the actual value of the tobacco sold on the auction floor. Gold producers are allowed to deposit the same percentage of their proceeds in FCAs as exporters of other goods, and they receive the international price at the interbank rate for the remainder. Exporters have 21 days to use FCA balances; after that time, FCA balances must be sold in the interbank market. Resident individuals may open FCAs in local branches of ADs in one of the currencies determined by the RBZ. They may also open rand and pula accounts. Effective January 31, 2008, deposits exceeding US$10,000 (previously, US$2,000) are subject to declaration of source.

The customs duty regime consists mainly of ad valorem duties, which range up to a maximum of 70% for luxuries, with a surtax of 10% on finished goods and specific duties on a number of products. Generally, imports are subject to an additional tax (between 12.5% and 20%) equivalent to the VAT imposed on goods sold domestically. Government imports and capital goods for statutory bodies are exempt from customs duties. Government imports are subject to the interbank rate.

Petroleum is imported by the National Oil Company, as well as by private companies under a license issued by the Ministry of Energy. Exchange Control Act. Exports and Export Proceeds Yes. Effective October 2, 2007, exporters, including EPZ companies and gold producers, may retain 65% of export proceeds (previously, 75%) in FCAs for 21 days; the remainder must be sold to the RBZ at the rate of Z$30,000 per US$1. At the end of that time, unused FCA balances must be sold in the interbank foreign exchange market. Previously, exporters were allowed to retain FCA balances for an indefinite period. Effective the same day, cotton and tobacco producers are allowed to retain 25% (previously, 15%) in FCAs. Corporate FCA holders (nonresident controlled companies and EPZ companies that are wholly financed from abroad) may use retained foreign exchange earnings for an indefinite period for purposes specified on a priority list and for other business-related expenses. An additional 10% of receipts must be paid to the FESF, to which the RBZ also contributes 10% from its 25% compulsory surrender. Effective May 2, 2008, the retention rate of export proceeds is linked to the increase in export revenues. Exporters with (1) a 0%–9% incremental export increase may retain 65%; (2) a 10%–19% incremental export increase may retain 75%; (3) a 20%–24% incremental export increase may retain 85%; (4) a 25%–29% incremental export increase may retain 90%; (5) a 30%–34% incremental export increase may retain 95%; and (6) an incremental export increase of 35% or more may retain 97.5% for their own use. A retention rate of 60% for incremental export proceeds applied during 2007. Effective October 2, 2007, exporters have the following options for investing their export proceeds with the RBZ: (1) The exporter may sell 100% of export proceeds to the RBZ at the prevailing exchange rate of Z$30,000 per US$1 and invest at the RBZ’s overnight window at a one-off overnight return of 800%. (2) The exporter may retain 65% and invest 35% at the overnight window. (3) The exporter may sell its FCA entitlement to the RBZ through the overnight investment window. Ten percent of export earnings are directed toward the FESF, effectively increasing the surrender requirement to 32.5%. Payments for exports must be received in foreign currency transferred into Zimbabwe through the banking system, except when there are special 1593 ©International Monetary Fund.
