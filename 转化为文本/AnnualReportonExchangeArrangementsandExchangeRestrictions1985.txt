Introduction The period covered by this Report is 1984 and, for major developments, the first quarter of 1985. The Report draws on information available to the Fund from a number of sources, including that provided in the course of consultation visits to member countries, and it has been prepared in close collaboration with national authorities. The International Monetary Fund's Articles of Agreement provide for notification by member countries to the Fund of a comprehensive description of their exchange controls and exchange rate arrangements, and changes in these as they occur. Measures intensifying members' restrictions on imports are also monitored by the Fund in the context of its function of surveillance over exchange rate policies of members. The Report centers on exchange arrangements and exchange restrictions, but it is also more comprehensive in that it presents other external economic policy measures and intergovernmental arrangements that may have direct balance of payments implications. As in previous Reports, in the descriptions of members' systems questions of definition and jurisdiction have not been raised; the description in the Report of a restrictive practice by a member does not mean that it is or is not being maintained consistently with the Fund's Articles, or that, if subject to Article VIII, it has or has not been approved by the Fund. Global Environment Global output and trade recovered strongly in 1984, as inflation in the industrial countries remained relatively subdued and further progress in the devel- oping countries was made in tackling the problem of overindebtedness. The stalemate in trading relations nevertheless persisted, as official intervention in the international goods markets continued to be wide- spread, and pressures for further protectionist mea- sures intensified. In financial markets, by contrast, industrial countries further liberalized capital con- trols, and developing countries on balance reduced the restrictiveness of their regulations affecting interna- tional payments. The volume of world trade expanded by 9 percent in 1984, building on the incipient upturn in the previous year. Its cyclical pattern in relation to aggregate world output, which grew at 4 percent in 1984, was similar to that of the previous rapid trade expansions in 1973 and 1976 (Chart 1). From a longer-term perspective, comparing the developments in the last two decades, the ratio of global output growth to trade growth has also been quite stable. However, this stability of the trade elasticity has not necessarily meant that protectionism has been con- tained. First, the present recovery in trade has been much more concentrated on relatively open markets in the United States. In 1984 the United States accounted for over one half of growth in the value of world imports, compared to less than one fourth in 1976, and even less in 1973. Other industrial countries accounted for the other half of import expansion, while in the developing countries renewed growth of imports by non-oil exporters was offset by a continued contraction of imports of oil exporters (Chart 2). 3 ©International Monetary Fund.

Shares of Major Country Groups in Change of World Imports, 1971-84l (In percent) 'Trade (exports plus imports) and output (gross national product) are in volume terms. Changes for 1964-71 are annual compound percentage rates. Prior to 1977, the People's Republic of China is excluded. Second, the slower growth in world output over the past decade may itself have been partly attributable to the effects of protectionism on trade, through result- ing supply inefficiencies, resource misallocation, and sluggishness in the transmission of growth of demand from more expansionary economies. From a sectoral perspective, more technologically advanced imports—which are the most difficult to subject effectively to protectionist measures owing to the changing nature of the products—expanded most rapidly in 1984. In descending order of growth were imports of electronics, automobiles, iron and steel, textiles and clothing, and agricultural products and minerals. Slower-growing and lower-value-added in- dustries have tended to be most exposed to shifting exchange rates and comparative advantage, and there- fore to pressure for official intervention to slow, or even reverse, the shifts and their effects on employ- ment. Intervention has been particularly evident in textiles and clothing and, over a longer period of time, in agricultural trade. Employment effects have taken on special sensitivities as, since 1981, unemployment has remained at a relatively high level in most 4 'Annual change in each group's imports (in U .S. dollars on f .o .b. basis) are expressed as percentage of annual changes in global imports. 2Algeria, Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Kuwa i t, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Nigeria, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela. industrial countries, in excess of 8 percent on average, or about double the previous level in the period since the mid-1960s. Strong industrial country demand in 1984, coupled with a modest improvement in the terms of trade, was reflected in a sharp increase (by 11 percent) in export receipts of the group of non-oil developing countries. Notwithstanding the implementation of measures aimed at bringing aggregate demand into line with available supply by several countries in this group, imports grew by 6 percent in volume terms, reversing an earlier decline. Assisted also by some easing of international interest rates in 1983-84, the current account deficit of non-oil developing countries nar- rowed markedly, to US$38 billion in 1984, compared with the peak of US$108 billion in 1981 and US$52 billion in 1983. The improved current account position was reflected in a further slowing of total debt accumulation by non-oil developing countries (by just over 5 percent to US$731 billion), down from an average 17 percent rate in 1980-82, and somewhat lower than in 1983. Short-term debt in particular has declined markedly in the past two years. Difficulties in obtaining short-term trade financing resulting from the presence of widespread payments arrears have ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INTRODUCTION provided a spur to the growth of less efficient barter and countertrade arrangements, by which exchange proceeds are in effect secured against import financ- ing. Countertrade has also been used as a means of circumventing restrictive and cartel arrangements, and of applying an implicitly depreciated exchange rate to exports. Adjustment programs and multilateral debt restructuring aimed at normalizing relationships with creditors and eliminating arrears were adopted by a number of Fund members in 1984, or negotiations to these ends are presently underway. As grace periods following earlier debt restructurings expired, the decline in debt-servicing ratios observed in 1983 ceased. Exchange Rate Arrangements Exchange rate movements of major currencies were more volatile in 1984, in contrast to the reduced variability of real interest rate differentials. The increased exchange rate volatility, especially of the other major currencies vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar, reversed the tendency toward reduced short-term exchange rate variability that had emerged since 1980. A salient feature of exchange rate developments was the continued strength of the U.S. dollar against the currencies of most other member countries in the face of a mounting U.S. external current account imbalance. Factors involved, operating especially through capital movements, have been an increased preference for dollar assets arising from the relative vigor of the strength of the U.S. economy, differen- tials between real interest rates, political and eco- nomic uncertainties elsewhere in the world leading capital to seek a "safe haven" in the dollar, and rigidities, particularly in labor markets, which have made other currencies less attractive. Interest rate differentials, which have been bolstered by the effects on the attractiveness of the dollar as a store of value of the success of the U.S. Federal Reserve in countering inflationary pressures, have often favored U.S. dollar- denominated assets—although since August 1984 the differentials have narrowed substantially. Another factor was the greater mobility of savings permitted by the close, and increasing, integration of interna- tional financial markets. At times during the year, sizable official intervention to promote orderly mar- kets was undertaken by some countries during episodes of high exchange rate volatility. Never- theless, overall reliance on official intervention to counter exchange rate movements lessened in 1984, continuing the trend in recent years noted in earlier Reports. Although no changes were introduced in the institu- tional arrangements of the European Monetary Sys- tem (EMS), the currency composition of the European Currency Unit (ECU) was modified in 1984 by the inclusion of the Greek drachma and by readjustment of the weighting coefficients of the currencies in the ECU basket. The stability of exchange rates within the cooperative arrangement was assisted by increased convergence of fiscal and monetary policies and of inflation performance. Since February 1973 the major industrial countries have maintained exchange arrangements under which rates have floated freely. The exchange rate ar- rangements of smaller industrial and developing coun- tries have continued to evolve toward greater flexibil- ity. A major development in these arrangements that took place in 1984 and in early 1985 was an acceleration of this process, as one smaller industrial country (New Zealand) and five developing countries (the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, the Philippines, Uganda, and Zaire) adopted market-determined, inde- pendently floating exchange rates for their currencies. Previously, as of the end of 1983 only three devel- oping countries (Lebanon, South Africa, and Uru- guay) had such arrangements. In addition, the number of developing countries maintaining managed floating arrangements declined owing to the adoption of independent floats, while four countries adopted non- SDR currency basket pegs. Several developing coun- tries continued to adjust their exchange rates regularly in response to relative price movements so as to improve or to maintain international competitiveness, and in other cases the frequency of discrete adjust- ments was increased, thereby lessening the possibility of significant overvaluation of the exchange rate. For members with pegged arrangements the average (un- weighted) nominal devaluation in terms of the foreign currency to which the local currency was pegged was 21 percent, and for members with more flexible arrangements, the average (unweighted) nominal de- preciation in 1984 amounted to 31 percent—ranging up to over 80 percent for the peso argentine and the Israel shekel. The practical effect of the continued evolution of exchange arrangements of the developing countries toward greater flexibility, as well as that of the discrete adjustments of the pegged currencies, was a substantial real depreciation of the overvalued currencies of a number of countries, many of which had adopted financial programs supported by the use of Fund resources. Nevertheless, in terms of inflation- adjusted performance, the exchange rates of non-oil exporting developing members appreciated somewhat in 1984, following real depreciations in the two preceding years. 5 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS Commercial and Exchange Policy Developments Developments in members' exchange and trade policies in 1984 and the first quarter of 1985 were mixed. Although liberalizing measures were taken affecting members' exchange systems, pressures for protectionist trade policies intensified. Industrial countries maintained or hardened existing restrictions, without resorting on balance to major new restrictive actions. While voluntary restraints on steel exports to the United States were introduced and voluntary limits on certain imports from Japan to the European Community (EC) were reduced, restraints requested by the United States on automobile imports from Japan were eliminated in March 1985 and replaced by restraints announced by Japan with a higher overall ceiling. Despite the sharp recovery in world trade, tendencies toward further protectionist actions re- mained strong. Strengthened legislation to counter practices perceived to be unfair was enacted in Europe and North America. In recent years there has been increasing recourse to bilateralism in response to the retention or tightening of trade barriers. A feature of these barriers is that they have most often lacked transparency, so that the costs and benefits have not been readily apparent to all affected parties, particularly to consumers. In some instances, the lack of transparency has been so pronounced that even the existence of the barrier being cited has been difficult to ascertain. Continuing the trend toward the maintenance of the outward appearance of a more open trading system and despite some relaxation in 1984 of the level of restrictiveness in the form of taxes and tariffs, quantitative controls or bilateral agreements of various forms aimed at limiting imports—including the particularly opaque "administrative guidance" and "voluntary" export restraints—continued largely unabated. Protectionist measures in the major trading countries tended to be focused on specific sectors, including agriculture, steel, textiles and clothing, automobiles and electron- ics, that have faced structural adjustment to tech- nological and factor price shifts. In contrast, restric- tive measures adopted in many of the developing countries were largely across the board, in response to a decline in revenues from oil exports in the case of oil exporting countries, and to still considerable, al- though reduced, balance of payments difficulties in many of the non-oil developing countries. In the course of 1984, the need to reverse the protectionist drift was underscored in various national and international forums. Ranged against these offi- cial commitments have been concentrated protection- 6 ist pressures from organized interests, coupled with an insufficient recognition of the more diffuse costs to consumers and, ultimately, to national interests. The buildup of protectionist pressures, and the aim of not to be seen acceding to them, has also been accom- modated during the last several years by a movement in emphasis away from trade policies based on direct price or cost-related measures that have a readily identifiable impact on costs and prices toward non- tariff measures that may include, among others, such practices as outright prohibitions or quotas, "volun- tary" export restraints, and administrative impedi- ments. Among other factors to which the failure to reverse the momentum toward protectionism has been attributed, the following have been cited most widely: recent exchange rate developments, the magnitude of bilateral trade imbalances, "unfair" foreign trade practices, special national characteristics of a sector (e.g., agriculture), and infant industry protection or the need for protection in "new" high-technology industries. In many developing countries, there was a contin- ued trend toward greater restrictiveness in the form of quantitative measures affecting the import transaction itself. Nonquantitative restrictions showed relatively little change in incidence on balance. In contrast to the trend in recent years, however, and to the current trend in trade policy, the movement in restrictive practices affecting payments and transfers for interna- tional transactions was on balance toward greater liberalization. This was evident particularly in mea- sures relating to exports, capital transactions, and multiple exchange rates. With respect to measures affecting exports, there was in 1984 a net liberalization of access to export credit facilities and of repatriation and surrender requirements for export proceeds, and little net change arising from fiscal and tax incentives for exports. Restrictions on current invisibles, maintained mainly by developing countries, on balance under- went little change overall, in contrast to a tightening noted in the 1984 Report. Travel abroad was seen as a luxury purchase or as a vehicle for capital flight, thus motivating its restriction in some countries. The international system of capital transfers under- went overall liberalization in 1984. Measures affect- ing capital controls by developing countries were, on balance, in the direction of liberalization, following a tightening in recent years. The pace of the freeing up of the major international financial markets in indus- trial countries was also stepped up, particularly for nonbank transactions. The most significant aspect of liberalization by developing countries was in direct investment; enhanced arrangements for inward trans- ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INTRODUCTION fers of equity and portfolio capital into the developing countries assisted in substituting for excessive bank debt built up in recent years. In those countries that adopted them, more open exchange systems for current and capital transactions, coupled with flexible exchange rates, eliminated the overvaluation of the currency and diminished incentives for capital flows through illegal parallel exchange markets. Restrictive exchange practices in the form of multiple exchange rates were substantially reduced in 1984. Maintenance by members of multiple exchange rate systems had been observed in the 1984 Report to have increased in 1981 and 1982. In early 1984, the Fund undertook a review of such practices which concluded that Fund policies with regard to multiple exchange rates were generally adequate, but that in their implementation greater attention would need to be paid to specific arrangements for assisting mem- bers to phase out the practices as quickly as possible, in order to contain their adverse effects on balance of payments adjustment and resource allocation. In 1983 and 1984, the long-term trend of reduced recourse to multiple currency practices was resumed, as a number of members eliminated and simplified such practices, while relatively few adopted them or made them more complex. A feature of the elimination of the practices was the adoption of relatively flexible unified ex- change rate arrangements by members that had prev- iously maintained dual or multiple markets; the unification was most often undertaken in the context of programs supported by use of the Fund's financial resources. Exchange restrictions giving rise to external pay- ments arrears continued to be prominent in 1984, despite very large debt-restructuring operations. Ex- ternal payments arrears continued to increase in aggregate, to SDR 43 billion, as rescheduling ar- rangements were delayed for several of the largest members that had incurred sizable amounts of arrears. Nevertheless, for the first time since 1978, there was a reduction in the number of countries incurring arrears, and it is expected that the conclusion of several large restructuring exercises now underway will cause aggregate arrears to diminish sharply in 1985. The presence of these disorderly restrictions on provision of exchange was one factor that led the Fund in 1984 to review its role in the settlement of debt disputes, in addition to conducting its usual annual review of developments in members' arrears. It is concluded in the reviews that the functioning of the international monetary system depended vitally on members' fulfil- ling their financial obligations promptly, and accord- ing to the terms of those obligations, and that the Fund had a direct interest in the settlement of overdue obligations and a role to play in accordance with the Articles of Agreement. It was noted that the circum- stances surrounding overdue financial obligations typically were complex, giving rise to important differences between individual cases. For this reason, the Fund has proceeded on a case-by-case basis and has shown caution in making judgments on issues involving disputed claims on such overdue obliga- tions. One conclusion was that the Fund's good offices in helping members engaged in the particular dispute over an external financing obligation were meant to bring the parties to a dispute together, and the Fund would act in such cases only if both parties wished to have the Fund provide its good offices. Arrangements for the settlement of payments arrears have, however, infrequently involved disputes and generally proceeded smoothly in an environment of multilateral cooperation. Multilateral restructurings of obligations were very large in 1983, amounting to some SDR 60 billion, as compared with SDR 6 billion in 1982. In 1984, the total of restructuring completed declined to SDR 23 billion, pending completion of arrangements for some SDR 100 billion of restructuring agreed in principle. The elimination or reduction of external payments arrears, mainly by restructuring but involv- ing some cash payments, continued to be an important objective of economic programs supported by use of Fund resources. The maintenance of payments arrears and the ensuing disorderliness in financial flows creates serious difficulties for debtor countries and is of substantial concern to foreign creditors. With the emergence of arrears, problems of external adjust- ment frequently intensify because the customary channels of external financing are disrupted. The elimination of external payments arrears in the course of a stabilization program therefore benefits the country through the reconstitution of financing streams. The total Fund membership increased in 1984 to 148 countries as two countries, Mozambique (Sep- tember 24, 1984) and St. Christopher and Nevis (August 15, 1984), joined the Fund. During the year, one country, St. Christopher and Nevis, accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement (on December 3, 1984), raising to 60 the number of members that have accepted these obligations. Of the 9 new Fund members since 1980, 4 have accepted the obligations of Article VIII; as of end-March 1985, one member (Mozambique) had not yet formally notified the Fund of its decision regard- ing Article VIII or Article XIV (but has since opted for Article XIV). At the end of 1984, 87 countries were availing themselves of the transitional ar- 7 ©International Monetary Fund.

Twenty- eight countries availing themselves of the transitional arrangements of Article XIV have exchange systems that are free or virtually free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international trans- actions. Thirteen of these countries are members of the West African Monetary Union or the Central African Monetary Area. II. Main Developments in Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Rates This section reports on major develoments in arrangements that Fund members have for determin- ing their exchange rates, as notified to the Fund in accordance with members' obligations under Arti- cle IV, Section 2(#), of the Articles of Agreement. Surveillance of exchange arrangements of members by the Fund, as required under Article IV, Section 3, is conducted in the context of regular consultations with members and during the intervening period between consultations, as changes in such ar- rangements are assessed by the staff and notified to the Executive Board. Under the provisions of the amended Article IV, Fund members have the right to maintain exchange arrangements of their choice, as well as certain obligations regarding the communica- tion of these arrangements to the Fund. To facilitate the implementation of the Fund's surveillance over exchange rate policies, members' exchange ar- rangements are classified under three broad headings, as follows: (1) currencies that are pegged to a single currency or to a composite of currencies (including the SDR); (2) currencies whose exchange rates, although not pegged, have displayed limited flexibil- ity compared with either a single currency or a group of currencies; and (3) currencies whose exchange rates are more flexible. The basic rationale for the classification of members' exchange arrangements is the extent and form of the flexibility that these arrangements permit, and this criterion is also applied to subcategorize each of the broad headings in Table 1. In 1984, over 60 changes in exchange arrangements occurred and were notified by members to the Fund, including measures that resulted in a reclassification of the basic type of arrangement, discrete adjustments of the exchange rate in terms of the peg, and a number of changes in the form of composite pegs. Included also are large discrete changes in exchange rates classified in the "More Flexible" category. Devel- opments in members' effective exchange rates are also monitored continually on the basis of available data to facilitate the symmetry of treatment of pegged and flexible exchange rates, and changes on a "real" inflation-adjusted basis in excess of 10 percent are 8 notified to the Executive Board when they occur. Nineteen such notifications of changes in real effec- tive rates since the preceding consultation with the member (or previous notification) occurred in 1984;1 this compares with six such notifications in 1983 when the system was introduced. Overall, the international exchange rate system continued to evolve toward greater flexibility of arrangements during 1984 and early 1985. All 12 reclassifications of arrangements in 1984 and the first quarter of 1985 were in this direction. A major new development in this period was the adoption of independently floating exchange rates by several developing countries. Six countries (the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, New Zealand, the Philippines, Uganda, and Zaire) introduced exchange ar- rangements by which their exchange rates are deter- mined by market forces. At the end of 1983, indepen- dently floating exchange rates had been maintained by only three developing country members: Lebanon, South Africa, and Uruguay. Another general devel- opment during this period was the movement by members away from "Limited Flexibility" ar- rangements of quasi-pegs to a single currency (in all instances the U.S. dollar) toward pegging to currency composites other than the SDR (Guyana, Malawi, and Thailand). One member (Sierra Leone) moved from the category "Pegged: U.S. Dollar" to the category "Pegged: SDR." A number of discrete changes in the exchange rate vis-a-vis currency composites were implemented in this period, as described below. One member (Equatorial Guinea) was reclassified from "Pegged: Other Currency" to "Pegged: French Franc" when the ekwele was withdrawn from circulation and replaced by the CFA franc, effective January 1, 1985. Another member (Peru) moved from a managed preannounced float to an arrangement under which the currency is adjusted on the basis of a set of indicators. Argentina, Bolivia, the People's Republic of China, Col- ombia, Egypt, Ethiopia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Liberia, Nigeria, Paraguay, the Philippines, Sierra Leone, South Af- rica, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Turkey, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, and Uruguay. A further nine notifications took place in the first quarter of 1985. ©International Monetary Fund.

Not for Redistribution • ° ° • ° • ° • REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS In addition to these changes, two new members informed the Fund in 1984 of their exchange ar- rangements: St. Christopher and Nevis has been classified within the group of countries whose curren- cies are pegged to the U.S. dollar, and Mozambique within the group of countries whose currencies are pegged to a currency composite other than the SDR. Since the inception of the present classification system in December 1981, the proportion of Fund members with "More Flexible" arrangements, includ- ing members maintaining a cooperative arrangement under the EMS, has risen from 28 percent to 32 percent in March 1985; and those with single currency pegs and "limited flexibility vis-a-vis a single currency" arrangement declined from 47 per- cent to 39 percent.2 As a consequence, the proportion of members with both types of currency composite arrangements increased from 25 percent to 29 percent (with the proportion of arrangements classified as "other currency composite" increasing from 16 per- cent to 21 percent). Reflecting these changes, the currencies of 50 members (including two new mem- bers) were pegged to a single currency at the end of March 1985 (32 to the U.S. dollar, 14 to the French franc, 2 to the South African rand, and 1 each to the Indian rupee and the pound sterling), compared with 51 members at the end of 1983. Twelve currencies remained pegged to the SDR, while "Other Compo- site" pegged arrangements increased from 27 to 31. Arrangements in the intermediate group of "Limited Flexibility" between pegged and flexible ar- rangements declined from 18 to 15. Of these 15 members, 7 were in the subclassification "Single Currency" (all against the U.S. dollar) as a result of having their exchange rate fluctuation within margins equivalent to 21A percent or less against an identifiable single currency of another member. Overall, 100 members, including two new members, had curren- cies classified under the "Pegged" category or the de facto pegged category of limited flexibility with respect to a single currency at the end of March 1985, as compared with 99 at the end of 1983. Another eight currencies in the "Limited Flexibility" category were those of countries maintaining cooperative ar- rangements within the EMS. Thirty-nine members maintained exchange arrangements in the "More Flexible" category; of those, 6 adjusted their ex- change rates according to a set of indicators, 19 had managed floating arrangements, and the currencies of 14 members (of which 8 were developing countries) floated independently. 2Excluding the arrangements of Democratic Kampuchea, for which information is not available. 10 Developments Affecting the Classification of Exchange Arrangements In 1984 eight members notified the Fund of changes in their exchange arrangements that involved a reclassification. (The end-March 1985 classification is shown in Table 1.) The authorities of Malawi informed the Fund that with effect from January 17, 1984 the Malawi kwacha had been delinked from the SDR and pegged to a new basket of currencies reflecting Malawi's trade with its major trading partners. Malawi was thus reclassified from the category "Pegged: SDR" to the category "Pegged: Other Composite." Two countries were reclassified from the category "Flexibility Limited vis-a-vis a Single Currency" to the category "Pegged: Other Composite." Guyana notified the Fund that, effective October 6, 1984, the exchange rate for the Guyana dollar would be changed periodically in accordance with movements against the U.S. dollar of a basket of currencies consisting of the pound sterling, the deutsche mark, the Japanese yen, the French franc, and the Netherlands guilder. The composition of the basket had been changed on January 11, when the exchange rate had been de- valued by 20 percent and the U.S. dollar and the Trinidad and Tobago dollar had been omitted from the basket. The U.S. dollar continues to be the interven- tion currency, and rates for the Guyana dollar in terms of the U.S. dollar are announced every week. For the week beginning October 6, the midpoint exchange rate against the U.S. dollar was set at G$4.12 = US$1, representing a 9 percent depreciation against the previous rate of G$3.75 = US$1. The authorities of Thailand advised the Fund that, with effect from November 5, 1984, the baht was adjusted from B 23 = US$1 to B 27 = US$1, representing a 14.8 percent devaluation against the intervention currency, the U.S. dollar, and the rate was henceforth linked to a basket of currencies. The composition of the basket reflects Thailand's trade with its major partners. During the period under review, there were five reclassifications within the "More Flexible" group. Four countries instituted changes in their respective exchange arrangements which led to their reclassifica- tion from the category "Managed Floating" to that of "Independently Floating." The authorities of Jamaica notified the Fund that with effect from Novem- ber 29, 1984 the exchange rate was to be permitted to float freely. The band, which had constrained the U.S. dollar/Jamaica dollar rate set in the auction market introduced on March 20, 1984 and which was periodically adjusted to offset persistent demand ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RATES pressures for foreign exchange, was removed. Jamaica had instituted on March 20, 1984 a new exchange rate system by which the rate was deter- mined at biweekly auctions, and was limited to within an adjustable band of J$0.30, which was adjusted whenever there existed a persistent excess demand for foreign exchange at the auctions. The band was adjusted on several occasions, and the Jamaica dollar depreciated by 15.4 percent against the U .S. dollar between October 2 and November 20, from J$4.11 = US$1 to J$4.86 = US$1. The Philippine authorities informed the Fund that, effective October 15, 1984, the practice of publishing a "guiding" exchange rate permitting the rate to be determined only partly on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market was abandoned. The rate is now to be determined freely by market forces. In conjunction with the float of the Philippine peso, the requirement for surrender of foreign exchange to the Central Bank imposed on authorized agent banks was eliminated and the foreign exchange allocation scheme was abolished. In addition, the 10 percent excise tax on foreign exchange sold by the Central Bank and authorized agent banks for payments other than for imports was eliminated; on the other hand, a 1 percent tax was imposed on all foreign exchange transactions other than interbank operations in the foreign ex- change market. Uganda unified the previous dual exchange rate system on June 15, 1984, and the exchange rate is now determined in a weekly auction administered by the Bank of Uganda. As indicated by the relative stability of net foreign exchange reserves, the Bank of Uganda has not intervened in the foreign exchange market to a significant extent, and the exchange arrangement has been reclassified as "Inde- pendently Floating." In Zaire, the official and free market exchange rates of the zaire were unified on February 24, 1984, at a rate equivalent to Z 1 = SDR 0.02869. The parallel exchange market has since been virtually eliminated as a result of the measures, and the Bank of Zaire intervenes in the exchange market in order to influence the speed of adjustment and to smooth any erratic movements. Zaire has been reclassified as having an "Independently Floating" exchange arrangement. One country was reclassified from the category "Managed Floating" to the category "More Flexible: Adjusted According to a Set of Indicators." As of February 29, 1984, Peru abandoned its policy of preannouncing the exchange rate and announced that henceforth the exchange rate would be frequently adjusted by small amounts corresponding to at least the rate of domestic inflation. Two countries entered the Fund as new members in 1984. The exchange arrangement of St. Christopher and Nevis was classified as "Pegged: U .S. Dollar" as the country's currency, the Eastern Caribbean dollar, is pegged to the U.S. dollar at a midpoint rate of EC$2.70 = US$1. The exchange arrangement of Mozambique was classified as "Pegged: Other Com- posite" in light of the fact that the metical is pegged to a weighted basket of six currencies. In early 1985, two countries were reclassified within the group of "Pegged" currencies. Equatorial Guinea informed the Fund that with effect from January 1, 1985 the ekwele was replaced as the national currency by the CFA franc, issued by the Bank of Central African States (BEAC). The CFA franc is pegged to the French franc at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. Sierra Leone notified the Fund that, with effect from February 21, 1985 the official exchange rate for the leone was depreciated by 58.3 percent against the U.S. dollar, from Le 2.5 = US$1 to Le 6.0 = US$1. At the same time, the peg for the leone was changed from the U .S. dollar to the SDR, with the Bank of Sierra Leone issuing daily equivalent exchange rates for the leone in terms of all major currencies. Two countries adopted independently floating ex- change arrangements in early 1985. Following the easing of a number of exchange controls affecting capital flows in late 1984, the authorities of New Zealand have since March 4, 1985 ceased to quote buying and selling rates for the New Zealand dollar against foreign currencies, and have allowed the exchange rate to be determined by market forces; as a result, New Zealand has been reclassified from the category "More Flexible: Managed Floating" to "More Flexible: Independently Floating." The Dominican Republic informed the Fund that, with effect from January 23, 1985 the previously existing dual exchange markets were unified, and all official foreign exchange transactions carried out by the Central Bank now take place at the average market- determined exchange rate during the preceding five working days, except those for which the peso counterpart of the obligations in foreign exchange had already been deposited with the Central Bank and certain other transactions that had already been autho- rized by the Monetary Board. All other transactions take place at the free market rate of the day. A major step toward the unification of the exchange system had been taken on April 17, 1984 when a number of transactions were transferred to the parallel market and an exchange incentive of RD$0.48 per U .S. dol- lar was introduced for exports of traditional com- modities, services (except tourism), and value added by industrial free zones. As a result of the unification 11 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS and float of the exchange rate, the Dominican Re- public has been reclassified from the category "Pegged: U.S. dollar" to the category "More Flexible: Independently Floating." Developments in Currencies of Industrial Countries3 Few changes took place in the EMS during 1984. The currency composition of the European Currency Unit (ECU) was changed, effective September 17, 1984, by a readjustment of the weighting coefficients of currencies in the ECU basket, and by the inclusion of the Greek drachma in the ECU for the first time. The amounts of currencies in the basket that had depreciated in recent years (French franc and Italian lira) were increased at the expense of those currencies that had appreciated (deutsche mark and Netherlands guilder), returning the percentage weights close to their initial values at the time the EMS was estab- lished in 1979. On September 17, the amounts of the currencies were fixed using the following weighting coefficients: deutsche mark, 23 percent; French franc, 19 percent; pound sterling, 15 percent; Italian lira, 10.2 percent; Netherlands guilder, 10.1 percent; Belgian franc, 8.2 percent; Danish krone, 2.7 percent; Greek drachma, 1.3 percent; Irish pound, 1.2 percent; and Luxembourg franc, 0.3 percent. The central rates of the currencies participating in the exchange rate mechanism and the bilateral parities within the EMS remained unchanged. The readjustment of the coeffi- cients had only a minor effect on the divergence indicators of the participating currencies, which at the time of the change were well within their thresholds. A striking feature of exchange market devel- opments during 1984 was the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, as shown in its bilateral appreciations against all other currencies of the industrial countries, ranging from 6 to 20 percent (Table 2).4 The pound sterling had the largest depreciation against the U.S. dollar in 1984 (20.3 percent on an end-year basis) while the Canadian dollar had the smallest depreciation against the U .S. dollar (5.8 percent). 3Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. 4Based on the Fund's multilateral exchange rate model (MERM), in which the implicit weighting structure takes account of the relative importance of the country's trading partners in its direct bilateral relationships with them, of competitive relationships with "third countries" in particular markets, and of estimated elasticities affecting trade flows. 12 Since 1970, the earliest observation for the MERM index, the dollar had appreciated by 21 percent as of end-1984. After having appreciated by 9.4 percent in nominal effective terms in 1983, the U .S. dollar rose by a further 10.1 percent in 1984 while demand for dollar-denominated assets continued to be strong, as reflected in continuing large inflows of capital. As in 1983, there were sizable movements in the nominal effective exchange rates of the currencies of most industrial countries in 1984. In effective (MERM) end-of-year terms, the largest exchange rate appreciation was that of the U .S. dollar (10.1 per- cent). The Japanese yen appreciated by 0.4 percent, while the currencies of all other industrial countries registered depreciations in effective terms during 1984. The largest depreciations in effective terms were those of the pound sterling (10.3 percent), the Italian lira (4.7 percent), and the Irish pound (4.0 percent). Other Developments in Exchange Rate Arrangements Notifications describing modifications to exchange arrangements that did not entail any change in the Fund's classification of exchange arrangements were received on more than 40 occasions in 1984. As in 1983, most of the changes took the form of discrete adjustments in the exchange value of pegged and flexibly determined currencies; other changes in- cluded new methods for determining exchange values, and details of new currency and exchange arrangements. As in 1982 and 1983, virtually all Fund members with pegged arrangements that adjusted their ex- change rates devalued against the peg or intervention currency. Among the countries with pegged ar- rangements that altered their exchange rates, only four revaluations were effected against currency baskets, including one against the SDR. However, in two of these instances, the amount of the revaluation was small, and in another, the amount of revaluation did not offset the prior and subsequent devaluations over the year as a whole. Only one member (Vanuatu) therefore revalued its exchange rate by a sizable amount (Table 3). One member (Western Samoa) in the "More Flexible" category revalued its currency in response to a sizable devaluation of the intervention currency. Among the six countries that revalued their curren- cies in the course of 1984, Finland changed the index which is used to calculate the external value of the markka on January 1, omitting the Soviet ruble from ©International Monetary Fund.

The former base year of 1974 used to calculate the index was replaced by a moving reference year. The largest weights in the index are presently (from July 1) those of the deutsche mark (19.5 percent), the Swedish krona (18.2 per- cent), the pound sterling (15.6 percent), and the U.S. dollar (9.4 percent); as from March 15, 1985, the weights are adjusted quarterly. Also, with effect from March 27, the Bank of Finland revalued the markka by about 1 percent within the range of fluctuation of the currency index. Madagascar re- valued the Malagasy franc by 1.1 percent against its currency composite on September 24, but this appre- ciation of the currency was more than offset by the three devaluations which occurred during the year that are noted below. Romania revalued the commercial exchange rate at which most transactions take place by 32.5 percent against the U.S. dollar with effect from November 1. At the same time, the noncommer- cial rate, which is used for private tourism and is pegged to the same basket as the commercial rate, was revalued by 20.8 percent against the U.S. dollar. The official rate, which is used only for statistical pur- poses, was revalued by 11.8 percent against the U.S. dollar. Vanuatu revalued the midpoint exchange rate of the vatu by 5.6 percent on March 12, from VT 106.20 = SDR 1 to VT 100.60 = SDR 1.

Among those currencies that were devalued, some members reduced the international value of the cur- rencies on a regular periodic basis, while others were guided by an explicit or implicit set of economic indicators. The magnitudes of the devaluations tended to be smaller for countries with composite currency pegs. Among those members with currencies pegged to the U.S. dollar that devalued in 1984, Bolivia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Paraguay, Sudan, and Venezuela in effect devalued their currencies by modifications to multiple exchange rate regimes that are described in the section below dealing with multiple currency practices. In the instances of Bolivia and Paraguay, several changes were made in the course of the year. The Yemen Arab Republic devalued four times during the year. The midpoint rate against the U.S. dollar was devalued by 6.2 percent on February 15 from YRls 4.67 = US$1, by 7.8 percent on May 20, by 5.75 percent on August 15, and by 2.05 percent on November 4, to reach a midpoint rate of YRls 5.86 = US$1. Only one other country in the category "Pegged: Other Single Cur- rency" devalued. The Gambia adjusted the exchange rate of the dalasi against the pound sterling on February 25, from D 4 = £1 to D 5 = £1, representing a 20 percent devaluation. Among those countries with arrangements classified as "Pegged: SDR," Kenya adjusted its exchange rate against the SDR on May 15, from a rate of K Sh 14.562464 = SDR 1 to K Sh 14.786818 = SDR 1, representing a 1.5 percent devaluation. Four countries pegged to other currency composites depreciated their exchange rate in 1984. Botswana depreciated the pula by 5.1 percent against the currency basket to which the pula is pegged, effective July 7. On January 10, 1985, the pula was depreciated by a further 15 percent, and at the same time the weight of the South African rand in the pula basket was increased from 50 to 75 percent. Hungary devalued the forint by 3 percent against the basket to which it is pegged on February 7, and again by 5 percent on June 26. In Madagascar the exchange rate of the Malagasy franc was devalued in terms of its composite basket three times in 1984; by 13 percent on March 17, by 2 percent on June 21, by a further 2 percent on July 2, although this latter devaluation was partly offset by a 1.1 percent appreci- ation of the exchange rate against the basket on September 24, and by an appreciation of 3.2 percent on January 2, 1985. On June 15, Tanzania devalued the shilling by 25.9 percent against its intervention currency, the U.S. dollar, from T Sh 12.59 = US$1 to T Sh 17 = US$1. Among the countries classified as having exchange rates showing "Limited Flexibil- ity vis-a-vis a Single Currency," Ghana devalued the cedi vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar on three occasions in 1984: by 14.3 percent on March 26, by 10 percent on August 23, and by 23 percent on November 30, at which time the exchange rate stood at <£ 50 = US$1. On January 11, Guyana announced that the ex- change rate of its currency against the U .S. dol- lar, which remained the intervention currency, was devalued by 20 percent from G$3 = US$1 to G$3.75 = US$1. On the same date, a change in the composition of currencies making up the basket was also announced, whereby the U .S. dol- lar and the Trinidad and Tobago dollar were replaced in the basket by the French franc and Netherlands guilder. Changes in exchange rates in 1984 of currencies subject to "More Flexible" arrangements are shown in Table 4. Among the countries with exchange ar- rangements classified as "More Flexible," two coun- tries adjusted their exchange rates "According to a Set of Indicators." Chile depreciated the exchange rate of the peso vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar by 19.1 percent on September 18 from Ch$93 = US$1 to Ch$115 = US$1. On December 8, 1984 the peso was devalued by 3.6 percent, from Ch$122.33 per U.S. dollar to Ch$126.92 per U.S. dollar. Thereafter, the peso has been depreciated on a daily basis at a rate reflecting domestic inflation in the previous month less an adjustment for external inflation. The cumulative rate of depreciation for the year was 31.7 percent (Table 4). On September 15, Somalia devalued the Somali shilling against the U .S. dollar by 32.5 per- cent, from the midpoint rate of So. Sh. 17.5556 = US$1 to So. Sh. 26 = US$1. The cumulative rate of depreciation for the year was 41.3 percent. Other countries that follow an explicit set of indicators in managing their exchange rates flexibly effected the following cumulative rates of depreciation in 1984 against their intervention currency, the U.S. dollar: Brazil, 69.1 percent; Colombia, 22.1 percent; Peru, 60.1 percent; and Portugal, 22.3 percent. Eight countries classified as "Managed Floating" adjusted their exchange rates in discrete fashion on occasions during 1984. Costa Rica depreciated the colon against the U.S. dollar on four occasions during the year. On August 31, Iceland ceased using an average of trade and payments weights in the currency basket determining the exchange rate of the krona, and opted for using trade weights only. As a result, the weight of the U.S. dollar in the reference basket was reduced from 46 percent to 30 percent. The change was made retroactive to May 27, 1983 and 15 ©International Monetary Fund.

This change was within the limits which had been set by the government for exchange rate adjustment for the second half of 1983 and for 1984. Following sharp increases in domestic costs, the Icelandic krona was devalued on November 20 by an average of 12 percent against a basket consisting of the country's main trading partners, and by 12.5 percent against the U.S. dollar, the principal reserve and trading cur- rency, from ISK 34.35 = US$1 to ISK 39.246 = US$1. Israel adjusted the representative rate of the shekel on September 17 as part of a series of economic measures. The rate was depreciated by 8 percent against the U.S. dollar, from IS 364.09 = US$1 to IS 395.79 = US$1, in addition to the regular depreciations reflecting inflation differentials. New 16 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RATES Zealand devalued its currency by 20 percent on July 18, as part of a set of economic measures taken in the wake of the general election held on July 14. The Philippines changed the "guiding rate" of the peso on June 6, from ¥ 14.002 = US$1 to? 18.002 = US$1, representing a 22.2 percent devaluation. In early January, Turkey announced that commer- cial banks could henceforth set their own buying and selling rates for foreign exchange within a band of 6 percent (8 percent for transactions in bank notes) around the official rate, although the spread between the buying and selling rates could not exceed 2 percent. The Central Bank announces the interbank buying and selling rates several times a day within a maximum spread of 1 percent, and transactions between the Central Bank and commercial banks serve as indicators for transactions between commer- cial banks. The above modification led to an effective one-step depreciation of the Turkish lira of about 6 percent early in 1984, since the banks depreciated their rates by the maximum amount permitted by the new margin. Uganda unified its two-tier exchange market on June 15, at a midpoint rate of U Sh 320 = US$1 determined by the new weekly auction system. This represented an 8.2 percent depreciation of the previously existing "Window One" midpoint rate, and a 3.1 percent appreciation of the "Window Two" midpoint rate. Western Samoa adjusted the exchange rate of the tala on three occasions during 1984. The midpoint rate against the New Zealand dollar was devalued by 4.3 percent from WS$1.06 = $NZ 1 to WS$1.1071 = $NZ 1 on May 7, and by 3.9 percent from WS$1.1071 = $NZ 1 to WS$1.1520 = $NZ 1 on May 31. Following the 20 percent devaluation of the New Zealand dollar on July 18 the midpoint rate was appreciated by 10.8 percent from WS$1.1520 = $NZ 1 to WS$1.04 = $NZ 1 on July 19. In terms of the currencies of Western Samoa's major trading partners, this last adjustment represented an effective depreciation of the tala of 4 percent. Two countries abandoned their policy of prean- nouncing their exchange rates during the period under review. In addition to the case of Peru mentioned above, Ecuador discontinued its policy of depreciat- ing the official exchange rate by S/. 0.05 per U .S. dollar each calendar day and fixed the midpoint rate on September 4 at S/. 67.175 = US$1, although the authorities stand ready to change the rate from time to time. In addition, the amount of transactions in the official market was sharply reduced as half of nonpetroleum exports, certain imports, and service on external debt disbursed on or after September 4, 1984 were shifted to the intervention market of the Central Bank, where the exchange rate was fixed on Septem- ber 4 at S/. 96.5 = US$1. The exchange rate in the free exchange market has meanwhile continued to be determined by market forces. Two changes in members' exchange arrangements, other than the discrete changes in exchange rates and reclassifications of arrangements noted above, took place in 1984. One country classified as "Pegged: French franc" changed its exchange arrangements during the period under review. Following Mali's entry into the West African Monetary Union (WAMU) on June 1, the CFA franc issued by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) replaced the Mali franc as Mali's currency unit. Mali francs could be exchanged for CFA francs for a three- month period starting June 1 at a rate of MF 2 = CFAF 1. Norway changed the method for calculating the basket index for the Norwegian krone on July 2. The new index is based on a geometric average of changes in individual exchange rates from their base values, rather than on the previously used arithmetic average. The base exchange rates and weights for the basket remained unchanged. The following changes occurred in the first quarter of 1985. Among the countries pegged to the U .S. dollar, the Yemen Arab Republic devalued the midpoint rate against the U.S. dollar by 9.6 percent on February 11 from YRls 5.86 = US$1 to YRls 6.485 = US$1. Three countries pegged to a currency composite modified their respective ex- change arrangements. On January 10, Botswana depreciated the pula by 15 percent against the cur- rency basket to which it is pegged, and the weight of the rand in the pula basket was increased from 50 to 75 percent. Hungary decided that effective January 3 the National Bank would quote the official exchange rate of foreign currencies five times per week, as against the previous once a week, except for notes and checks. Mauritania devalued the ouguiya by 16 per- cent against the U.S. dollar, effective February 15 as the exchange rate was adjusted from UM 67.15 = US$1 to UM 80 = US$1. In addition, all broken cross rates were eliminated. Among the countries whose currencies are adjusted according to a set of indicators, Chile adjusted the exchange rate of the peso from Ch$132.17 = US$1 to Ch$144.07 = US$1 effective February 27, representing an 8.2 per- cent devaluation. On January 1, 1985 Somalia adopted a market-determined exchange rate applica- ble to most private sector transactions and simulta- neously adjusted the exchange rate in the official market from So. Sh. 26.0 = US$1 to So. Sh. 36.0 = US$1, representing a 28 percent devaluation. During a six-month period, the official exchange rate, which now applies to external transactions of the Central 17 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS Government and to the surrendered portion of ex- ports, will continue to be adjusted in accordance with the present system of pegging to the SDR in real terms, and, in addition, depreciated by So. Sh. 0.5 per U.S. dollar a month until end-June 1985. Al- though these measures imply a dual exchange rate arrangement, the authorities of Somalia intend to un ify the official exchange rate with the market rate. Also, effective January 1, 1985 the franco valuta system was abolished and foreign exchange can be bought and sold freely by both residents and nonresi- dents. In the category "More Flexible: Managed Floating," Western Samoa discontinued the link be- tween the tala and the New Zealand dollar with effect from March 1. The exchange rate is now determined with reference to a weighted basket of currencies and other factors considered important by the authorities. As a result of the change, the midpoint exchange rate of the tala was adjusted from WS$2.338 = US$1 to WS$2.342 = US$1, representing an 0.2 percent de- valuation against the U .S. dollar, which has replaced the New Zealand dollar as the intervention currency. III. Main Developments in Restrictive Practices Imports and Import Payments Although world trade increased rapidly in 1984 and early 1985, protectionist pressures continued to be strong. Imports of manufactures in particular contin- ued to be subject to actions of a broadly countervail- ing nature in response to perceived unfair trade practices in other countries, although the extent to which actions and reactions were matched was un- clear, because in many instances there was a lack of transparency of the initiating action abroad. Major actions extending protectionism took place in the textile and steel industries. Trade in automobiles and electronics continued to be subject to much the same limits in 1984, although markets in these products grew rapidly, and the limits tended to be expressed in absolute terms. In early 1985, significant action was taken to liberalize U.S. imports of automobiles from Japan. There were relatively few new measures introduced in the period under review affecting trade in agricultural products, although protection in this area and the corresponding budgetary costs were already intense, and discussions were underway of retaliatory subsidies for cereal exports by the United States. Continuing the trend of recent years, nonquan- titative actions imposing tariffs and surcharges on imports were relatively few by comparison with the large number of quantitative restrictions that were either introduced or intensified; this has marked the evolution of exchange and trade systems in both the developed and the developing countries. One excep- tion in the latter group of countries was the recourse by several countries to minimum financing terms for certain imports. This represented a response to the difficulties experienced by a number of countries in obtaining trade credits, while they were in arrears on these or other international payments obligations. Major trade legislation aimed particularly at foreign competition perceived to be unfair was passed during 18 1984 by Canada, the EC, and the United States. Canada implemented the Special Import Measures Act in December 1984, intended to deal with unfair competitive practices of foreign producers. In August 1984 new EC legislation relating to dumped or subsidized imports from countries outside the area also became effective. In addition, the EC adopted in September 1984 the New Commercial Policy Instru- ment, which is intended to enable the Community to respond more rapidly to unfair trading practices by other countries. The United States Trade and Tariff Act, signed into law on October 30, 1984, while extending the General System of Preferences (GSP) as noted below, also extended the reach of antidumping and countervailing duty laws in some areas. Protectionism in the agricultural sectors of indus- trial countries remained intense, although there were some encouraging developments toward checking the more extreme practices. On March 31, 1984, the EC took steps to reform the Community's common agricultural policy, with a view to containing budget- ary expenditures on agriculture. The agreement provided for an average cut of 0.5 percent (in terms of European Currency Units) in the community-wide level of support prices, the first reduction in the history of the EC; within the general agreement, some members were authorized to introduce compensatory national actions. The Community also introduced milk production quotas with a view to controlling dairy production and agreed to dismantle progres- sively the complex system of border taxes and subsidies (monetary compensation accounts). At var- ious times during the year Japan announced increases in imports of a number of agricultural products. A number of developing countries adopted com- prehensive adjustment programs with realistic ex- change rates and improved their external positions, while at the same time liberalizing their exchange and trade systems. However, comprehensive foreign ex- ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES change restrictions remained or continued to be introduced in other countries. Among the developing countries there was a continuing although gradual movement toward substitution of tariffs by import quotas. The oil exporting developing countries suf- fered declining revenues as a result of the stagnation or weakening of international oil prices; in some of these countries import restrictions were intensified. In contrast to the restrictive legislation in the trade field noted above, all countries granting the GSP took actions in 1984 to extend their implementation of the preferences beyond 1985. Canada broadened the coverage of its GSP scheme and extended it for ten years. The EC reduced GSP rates for some 50 products. The United States extended the arrangement for eight and a half years, while adding several factors to be considered in determining a country's eligibility for GSP benefits, and providing for a gradual phasing out of benefits over a two-year period when a country's annual GNP per capita reached a certain level. Among other countries, Austria reduced GSP tariff rates on some 1,900 tariff lines, and Hungary, Japan, Norway, and Switzerland also enhanced their GSP treatment. In addition to the regular tariff cuts scheduled for 1985 under the Tokyo Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations (MTN), some countries planned to im- plement in 1985 the scheduled 1986 reductions and possibly also the 1987 reductions. The member countries of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) took a decision to this effect, and the EC announced, conditionally, similar actions with respect to products of interest to developing countries. All industrial countries supported acceleration of MTN tariff cuts. Japan undertook to reduce or eliminate tariffs on some 1,300 nonagricultural items in the fiscal year through March 1985. Norway and Sweden announced that the final three of eight agreed tariff reductions under the Tokyo Round would be imple- mented two years earlier than originally planned. On December 31, 1983, the EFTA and the EC completed the process of liberalization of virtually all tariff barriers and import restrictions on their intrare- gional trade in industrial products. The two groups agreed in April on a joint declaration aimed at eliminating remaining barriers to free trade: specifi- cally, harmonization of standards, elimination of technical barriers, simplification of border facilities, elimination of unfair trading practices, controls in state aid which might give rise to trade distortions, and the liberalization of government contracts. The United States in January 1984 provided duty-free access to the U.S. market for ten years on all products (with certain exceptions such as textiles and footwear) from Caribbean countries qualifying under the Carib- bean Basin Initiative. On July 1, 1984, the Preferen- tial Trade Area for East, Central and Southern African States (PTA) reduced tariffs on certain items. The list of items is to be expanded every three years until 1992, when the regional common market will be fu l ly established. Quantitative Import Controls There were few changes in the restrictive measures applied to agriculture. The EC decided to continue quota access for imports of butter from New Zealand at specified gradually declining levels for a further five years. The EC quota for imports of cheese from Finland was raised. Japan increased quota levels on imports of beef and citrus. Trade in textiles again became more restrictive in 1984. In May agreement was reached within the context of the Treaty of Rome in the Benelux countries to suspend for six months the EC treatment for imports of trousers, shirts, and divided skirts from the Philippines. At various times during the year, Canada acted to expand the coverage of bilateral clothing restraint agreements with the People's Re- public of China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mauritius, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. In March the EC concluded a bilateral trade agreement with the People's Republic of China, extending the list of products subject to restriction; it also imposed quotas on specified cloth- ing items from Hong Kong, the Philippines, Turkey, and Yugoslavia. At various times in 1984, Ireland restricted imports of specified textiles arriving from the rest of the EC, but originating in Hong Kong, India, the Republic of Korea, Macao, Pakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Romania, Taiwan,t Turkey, and Yugoslavia. All of these restrictions had expired by end-December 1984. New Zealand increased import license allocations in 1984. Norway extended its 1978 system of global quotas on various textile items and joined the Multifiber Arrangement (MFA). The United States introduced new customs regulations to apply more strict guidelines for determining the country of origin of textile items. The United States also intensified quantitative restrictions on imports of textiles and textile products. Among developing coun- tries, the People's Republic of China acceded in January to the MFA, and in August Panama applied to accede to the MFA. A number of new quantitative restrictions were introduced in the steel sector. Following the imposi- tion of safeguard measures on specialty steels by the tSee Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part Two, page 54. 19 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS United States in July 1983, Canada and the EC suspended equivalent concessions. The EC adopted, as of January 1984, a monitoring system to ensure that traditional trade patterns in steel products were not disturbed. The EC, in negotiating steel import ceilings with several other countries on the basis of 1980 performance, imposed reductions of 12.5 percent in 1984, as in 1983. The EC has bilateral agreements on steel imports into the EC with Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Japan, the Re- public of Korea, Poland, Romania, South Africa, and Spain. Reciprocal arrangements exist with Austria, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. In the United States the International Trade Commission reported a find- ing that certain carbon and alloy steel products were being imported into the United States in amounts such that imports had been a substantial cause of serious injury to the domestic industries. In response, a decision was made to negotiate "surge control" arrangements with major suppliers. In December, the United States announced bilateral agreements, covering a period of five years and restricting shares in the U.S. steel market to specified proportions, with Australia, Brazil, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, South Africa, and Spain. Under an agree- ment concluded in 1982 with the EC, exports of specified steel products to the United States are to be limited to about 5l/2 percent of the U.S. market. In late November, the United States banned imports of steel pipes and tubes from the EC until December 31, 1984, because such imports exceeded the level set in a letter of understanding between the United States and the EC. In response to European protests against the U.S. action, a formal bilateral agreement between the United States and the EC was reached in early 1985 regarding restraints on the Community's exports of pipes and tubes to the United States. Bilateral agreements to limit exports of specialty steels to the United States were concluded in 1984 by Argentina, Austria, Canada, Japan, Poland, Spain, and Sweden; an agreement with Brazil continued under negotiation as of the end of the year. In April, South Africa announced unilateral limits on steel exports to the United States. Trade in automobiles is subject to "voluntary" restraints in a number of industrial countries. Japan limited exports of passenger cars to the United States to 1.85 million units in the year ended March 1985, compared with 1.68 million units per year in the previous three years. Japanese car exports to Canada are also restrained. As in 1983, sales of Japanese cars were limited in the United Kingdom to 11 percent of the market, in France to 3 percent of the market, and in Italy to 2,200 units. In addition, Japan continued to 20 exercise moderation in its automobile exports to the European Community as a whole. On March 1, 1985, the Government of the United States announced that following the expiration of restraints on March 31, 1985, it would not ask Japan to extend its voluntary restraints on exports of automobiles from Japan to the United States. Subse- quently, Japan announced that the growth of exports of automobiles to the United States in the year April 1985-March 1986 would be limited to 24 percent in volume terms over the limit of the preceding 12 months. In the field of electronics, Japan restrained in 1984 exports to the EC of video tape recorders and color television tubes to specified amounts and exercised moderation in exports of color television sets, numeri- cally controlled lathes, and machine tools, as well as light commercial vehicles, fork lift trucks, motorcy- cles, audio equipment, and quartz watches. The quota for exports of television sets by the Republic of Korea to the United Kingdom was increased in 1984. Canada extended global import quotas on leather and nonleather footwear from the original expiry date of November 30, 1984 to November 30, 1985; the quotas were raised by 3 percent. Among the developing countries, a number of countries made progress during 1984 in reducing import restrictions and simplifying import regimes. In Ju ly, Bangladesh eliminated the requirement that imports under the Wage Earners' Scheme requiring a letter of credit also obtain an Import Registration Certificate. In September, Brazil more than halved the list of items subject to suspension of import licenses. In Ecuador and in El Salvador, the maximum limits on the size of automobiles that could be imported were raised. Hungary reduced the coverage of quota restrictions on imports by 25 percent in terms of local currency, and the reference limits for individual importing companies handling large and frequent transactions were reduced and subsequently abol- ished, along with the previous practice of discretion- ary approval bf import licenses for all other imports not covered by quotas. In addition, import quotas on certain categories of raw materials were abolished. In India, imports of a number of items were liberalized under the open general license scheme. In April, there was an increase in the number and scope of special import licenses issued against certain exports. In addition, industries producing exclusively for export were given some added flexibility in importing items required for export production. Limits on imports of certain items for manufacturer-exporters and other specified importers were also raised, as were limits on some advance remittances of authorized dealers. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES Korea removed some import restrictions, and stated that in future the annual list of imports to be freed from restrictions would be announced two or three years in advance, to enable domestic manufacturers to prepare for increased foreign competition; advance notice was given to free 546 items in 1985-86, and to reduce the proportion of total imports that are re- stricted to below 5 percent by 1988. In Mauritius quota restrictions maintained for either balance of payments reasons or for the protection of local industries were removed during the year for goods carrying customs duty of 30 percent or more, and import quotas were imposed for a number of goods whose importation was previously prohibited. In Mexico, regulations concerning import permits were liberalized, and a number of tariff items were ex- empted from permit requirements. In August, some additional imported items were exempted from import permits and in October the Government announced a calendar for the total elimination of import permits by 1990, with a gradual dismantling starting in 1987. Morocco liberalized certain aspects of its general import program and specified investment goods that could be imported directly in accordance with indus- trial investment programs. In Niger, import applica- tions for raw materials and certain consumer elec- tronic components were exempted from prior clearance in February, subject to certain conditions. This exemption was extended in March to imports of yarn, threads, and polybags for use by garment exporters, and to synthetic resin and derivatives thereof; also, permission to import completely knocked-down trucks, motorcycles, and raw materials or components was granted under specified terms and conditions. Restrictions on imports of equipment by exporters were eased somewhat in June, and authori- zation was granted in September for all cereal deriva- tives to be imported without licenses, and without payment of import taxes and duties. The priority system for allocation of foreign exchange for imports was abolished in October, and imports were reclas- sified as follows: freely importable, prohibited, banned, regulated, and liberalized. In South Africa, import controls were abolished on 90 different categories of goods, including pharmaceuticals, hand tools, toys, and carpets. In Tanzania, textile goods, electrical appliances, certain building materials, cer- tain vehicles, children's wear, and shoes were allowed to be imported without use of official foreign exchange, and regulations restricting the import of soap, cooking oil, and vehicles were relaxed. In Thailand, manufacturers and traders specifically com- missioned by manufacturers were allowed in February to import heavy-duty vehicles, and authorizations were granted throughout the year to import a variety of items. Tunisia in August eased restrictions on the importation of cars by Tunisians residing abroad. Western Samoa abolished the foreign exchange allo- cation system for private imports, except for alloca- tions for motor vehicles, durable capital equipment valued in excess of US$10,000, beer, cigarettes, timber, veneer, matches, and cigarette lighters. Quantitative import restrictions were introduced or intensified, and import regimes were tightened, in a number of developing countries during 1984. In Argentina the scope of the import licensing require- ment introduced at the end of 1983 was extended early in 1984 to public sector imports, and the list of prohibited imports was expanded significantly in August; in addition, the Secretary of Commerce was empowered to reject license applications for imports from countries that adopted discriminatory measures against Argentine exports or violated international agreements in a manner prejudicial to Argentine exports. On the other hand, the licensing requirement was eliminated in April for imports valued at less than US$500, up to an annual total of US$6,000 per tariff item, and in December an overall annual limit of US$24,000 per importer was established for licensing requirement exemptions. The lists of imports subject to license were enlarged at various times during the year by Barbados and by Fiji. In February, the People's Republic of China issued new regulations requiring prior inspection by relevant authorities of all imports before their release by the General Adminis- tration of Customs. Colombia transferred a number of tariff items from the free import category to licensing in February, and prohibited the importation of a wide variety of products the following month. Greece extended to December 1985 the quantitative restric- tions on selected imports from the EC. In Grenada, certain items of clothing were made subject to import licensing at the end of October; in November specified automotive items and steel and timber products were placed on the negative list of imports. India shifted a number of items from the Open General License scheme to more restriced import lists in the first half of the year. In October, Israel imposed a temporary ban on imports of certain luxury items. Malta restricted all imports from Italy at the end of October. In Nepal, the Government tightened in March regulations concerning imports by returning citizens. Early in the year, Nigeria discontinued the issuance of open general licenses, subjected all permitted imports to specific import licenses, and lowered the threshold value of imports subject to preshipment inspection; at the same time, prepayment for imports by the private sector and public corpora- 21 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS tions was prohibited, and a system of foreign ex- change allocations to authorized dealers was estab- lished. Peru in July imposed prior licensing requirements and a temporary ban on the importation of a number of product categories not originating in other Andean Pact countries. In December the import prohibition list was expanded and temporary prohibi- tions were made permanent. The Philippines required that all applications for the importation of specified types of chemicals obtain prior clearance. In addition, various regulations monitoring or tightening reporting requirements of authorized agent banks were in- troduced throughout the year. In early 1984 a scheme of safeguard clauses affecting certain imports was introduced in Portugal. In the course of 1984 Rwanda temporarily suspended import licenses for toilet and powdered soap, candles, and insecticides. Thailand, meanwhile, imposed licensing requirements on im- ports of numerous items, prohibited the importation of specified garments, and regulated the importation of palm oil. In the first half of the year, Trinidad and Tobago indefinitely suspended imports of aerated beverages and beer, introduced specific import licenses for certain electric and consumer goods, and placed imports of steel products on the negative list. In the context of changes in the management of the weekly foreign exchange system, a regulation was introduced in Uganda in November whereby suc- cessful bidders were required to obtain approved import entry forms and import licenses issued by the Ugandan Advisory Board of Trade; for imports in excess of US$20,000 pro forma invoices from three different suppliers were to be submitted before the import entry form could be provided. In Western Samoa all imports in excess of WS$10,000, other than imports of petroleum products, were required to be made under letter of credit arrangements, com- mencing in July. With effect from January 1, 1985 all import restrictions were removed in Niger, with the excep- tion of specific products whose importation remained either prohibited or subject to prior approval. On the same date, Nigeria abolished the system of foreign exchange allocations to authorized dealers which had been introduced at the beginning of 1984. On the other hand, an embargo on trade with Nicaragua became effective in the United States on May 7, 1985, along with restrictions on dealings with Nicaraguan air carriers and Nicaraguan-registry vessels. Import Surcharges and Import Taxation Among the non-oil developing countries there were several reductions in import duties, but on the whole 22 they were balanced by increases. Argentina elimi- nated in February the import duty on certain agricul- tural fertilizers. Brazil adopted a revised tariff schedule in September that replaced the previous surcharges of 30 percent and 100 percent on imports with additions of 10-30 percent to the basic tariff rates, thereby lowering substantially the average nominal rate of tariff protection. Colombia reduced duties in March and June on a number of items from Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Paraguay; also in March the value of items that could be imported duty- free from the free trade zone of San Andres and Providencia was increased, and in October, proce- dures for payment of import duties were simplified. Grenada in January reduced the stamp duty on imports. Hungary lowered in February the fee for license imports settled in convertible currencies, which was followed in April by the elimination of the 20 percent surcharge on imports of component parts, and in December by the reduction of customs duty rates for imports by Hungarian travelers and other individuals. As part of the import policy announced in April, India continued a duty exemption scheme and in October extended a concessional rate of duty to specified components of fuel-efficient vehicles. After a lowering in July of customs duties for imports of viscose fiber, further duty reductions were enacted in November for imports of computers, computer pe- ripherals, software, and other electronic items. In the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya agreement was reached in January to exempt certain Moroccan goods from import duties, and similar action was taken in December with respect to all Tunisian products. Korea in June reduced the number of items subject to an "emergency" tariff. Also in June Mauritius lowered the customs duty on imports of computers and components. Mexico modified import tariffs at various times during the year, with reduc- tions outweighing increases. In January, Morocco reduced the special import tax from 15 percent to 10 percent. Nicaragua in December replaced an exchange tax with a special import duty applicable to additional items, but at a considerably lower rate. Niger granted permission in August-September for cereals and their derivatives to be imported without payment of import taxes and duties. Early in 1984 Peru reduced import tariffs on vegetable oil products, fish oil, and automobile parts, followed in May by tariff reductions for imports of certain paper products and in July for imports of marine motors and spares. Exemptions from the import surcharge were granted in January for specified food items and in April for certain medical products. The Philippines reduced the ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES additional import duty for petroleum products from 10 percent to 5 percent in October; the reduction was to be extended to all other imports from January 1985. In March Portugal reduced the import surcharge from 30 percent to 10 percent and exempted a number of items from the surcharge. At the beginning of 1984 Saudi Arabia and Iraq agreed to exempt the trade of a number of products from taxes and tariffs. Thailand reduced in October import duties on computers; in November duties were lowered for petroleum prod- ucts and the import surcharge was lifted on a number of items. Uruguay in January replaced all existing surcharges and taxes on imports of parts and acces- sories of capital goods and agricultural machinery not competing with Uruguayan products with a global tariff rate of 10 percent; in July a ten-year exemption from all tariffs and taxes for imports of new fishing boats was granted. Across-the-board surcharges were introduced in 1984 by Mauritius and the Philippines. There were also several instances of selective increases in duties and surcharges. In July Chile imposed a 15 percent import surcharge on a wide range of items. In September all surcharges were eliminated and basic import duties were raised to a uniform level of 35 percent; in December the Government announced a plan to roll back the tariff level to 30 percent by end- June 1985, and to 25 percent before mid-1986. Costa Rica in January replaced a stamp tax with an import duty, which was increased in September. Colombia increased duties on several tariff items in July, and the Ivory Coast in November replaced quantitative re- strictions with temporary surcharges on imports, which would be reduced gradually over a period of five years. Also in July, The Gambia raised import duties and taxes on a wide range of items. In the 1984/85 budget introduced in April, India increased import duties on a wide range of products. Malawi in March raised the import levy, increased import duties on a selective basis and raised the surtax on luxury imports, and Mauritius introduced in June a surcharge on customs duty and on stamp duty. In July Peru imposed comprehensive increases in import tariffs at varying rates. The Philippines introduced in June, with a few exceptions, an additional duty to be added to all other duties, taxes, and charges on imports. In August Qatar raised the minimum customs duty on general goods. Rwanda raised import duties and taxes on a range of items in May. Saudi Arabia imposed in October a customs duty on imports of electric cables, and South Africa in July increased the general sales tax applicable on locally produced and imported goods, with certain exemptions. In March-April Thailand imposed import surcharges on a number of chemical products, and in October import duties and surcharges on a range of items were raised. In July Zimbabwe increased the duty on imports of motor spirits. At the beginning of March 1985, the People's Re- public of China announced changes in import duties which, on average, lowered tariffs by 10 percent. Advance Import Deposits During 1984 six countries eliminated, reduced or liberalized the scope of their deposit requirements, whereas eight countries introduced new schemes or extended existing ones. Greece eliminated at the beginning of the year a cash deposit requirement applicable to specified imports. In January Morocco reduced its advance import deposit requirement from 15 percent to 10 percent of the f .o.b. value of imports, and abolished the requirement in July. Pakistan abolished in September the minimum margin deposit requirement against import letters of credit for indus- trial raw materials. In July Rwanda exempted from advance deposit requirement import items on which import duty increases had been imposed in May, and authorization was granted for the remaining items for payment of interest at prevailing rates on the deposits. Suriname abolished the deposit requirement for im- ports in April. In the Syrian Arab Republic, certain private imports financed with foreign currency ob- tained abroad were exempted from the payment of an advance import deposit, provided that the deposit had been held for at least three months in a local bank and that the account holder had resided for at least one year in the country before opening such an account. Argentina introduced in January a 90-day prior import deposit requirement equivalent to the f .o .b. import value plus the relevant import duty rate or 5 percent, whichever was higher, to be lodged before the issuance of the import license; this amount could be drawn down before 90 days only for payment of associated import duties. In addition, for import payments requiring prior central bank approval, im- porters were required beginning in March to deposit the peso equivalent of the respective payment at the time of requesting the foreign exchange. Both types of advance import deposit were indexed to the U.S. dol- lar, and the national petroleum company was ex- empted in December from the 90-day deposit require- ment with respect to purchases under a special accord with the U.S.S.R. In November Colombia established that prior exchange license deposits for imports must be lodged at least 20 calendar days before the date for which the corresponding exchange license was re- 23 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS quired. Costa Rica, in June, doubled the deposit requirement in local currency to accompany foreign exchange requests, while Ecuador required in October that 100 percent advance deposits be paid in sucres for the amount of the import value financed abroad. In Israel, the one-year non-interest-bearing import de- posit requirement of 15 percent of the value of specified imports first introduced in June 1983, and then renewed in December 1983, was extended again for a further six-month period until December 1, 1984 and then renewed again until May 31, 1985. In October, imports of recently banned items (mostly luxury goods) stored in bonded warehouses, or en route to Israel on October 3, were subjected to a compulsory one-year deposit of 25 percent (not indexed to domestic prices and payable upon release from customs), in addition to the 15 percent import deposit requirement. Between January and May, Nigeria extended the advance import deposit require- ment to cover all imports other than rice and petro- leum, whether or not they were financed with credit facilities of over six months. In March, the Bank of Zaire introduced a formal requirement of a minimum mandatory deposit of 50 percent in zaires for the opening of uncovered letters of credit by importers. The deposit was raised to 65 percent in May and reduced back to 50 percent in November. One country increased advance import deposit requirements but subsequently proceeded to reduce them again; in February, the Yemen Arab Republic raised the amount of margin deposits against import letters of credit from a uniform rate of 20 percent of cost to 25 percent of cost for foodstuffs and fuel, 30 percent for raw materials, and 50 percent for other com- modities. In May, the two latter rates were reduced to 25 percent and 40 percent, respectively. In January 1985 Egypt reduced advance import deposit requirements from a range of 25 percent to 100 percent of the f.o.b. import value to one of 15 percent to 50 percent. In addition, deposits were required to be made in domestic currency, rather than in foreign currency, as had been the case previously. Other Measures Affecting Import Payments During 1984 a number of modifications were made to the regulations governing the terms or procedures for import payments. As in 1983, most of these changes involved easing of the terms of, or the procedures for, import payments. Among industrial countries, France raised the threshold level of individual import transactions sub- ject to a requirement of registration with an authorized 24 bank from F 150,000 to F 250,000 in July. Among developing countries, in April Brazil relaxed the operation of the requirement that import payments be financed on certain terms ranging from 3 years to 8 years in cases involving financing or guarantees by foreign governments, bilateral, or multilateral agen- cies. In September, the requirement that the licensing authority (CACEX) provide a statement that Brazilian firms were unable to supply a similar product was abolished for imports financed abroad. In Greece, all imports were exempted from bank approval require- ments, and all restrictions on permissible methods of import payments were lifted in January. At the same time, however, a time limit of 60 days from the arrival date at the first Greek port was imposed for settling import payments. Grenada liberalized payments for documented imports, first from CARICOM countries and later from non-CARicOM countries. India liberalized its import procedures in September and granted permission to authorized dealers to remit in advance, if necessary, the full value of any commer- cial imports up to the equivalent of US$1,000, subject to import control regulations. The limits on advance remittances were raised for certain other imports also. In Jamaica, the right of importers to bid in the foreign exchange auction to fulfill commercial bank require- ments that prior deposits be made before letters of credit could be opened was given in May, withdrawn in August, and reinstated in September. In addition, importers were granted permission in December to buy foreign exchange one to six months forward from the date of shipment of the goods in question. In Mozambique, private companies were permitted in May to retain up to 20 percent of their export earnings to finance their own imports of materials. In the Philippines, permission was granted in January for certain establishments and tourist duty-free shops acting as authorized foreign exchange dealers to make import applications up to 15 percent and 65 percent, respectively, of their foreign exchange earnings sur- rendered to the Central Bank during the year im- mediately preceding. In May, it was announced that certain essential consumer products could be imported on a prepaid letter of credit basis without limitations as to the amount, while certain other essential con- sumer products could be imported on the same basis, subject to a US$50,000 limit per bank per month with prior approval. In March, the Philippines extended the facility for the importation of producer items under prepaid letters of credit; foreign exchange payments for opening letters of credit were to be in the form of telegraphic transfers or financed from foreign cur- rency deposits; this facility was terminated in Octo- ber. In the Syrian Arab Republic, permission was ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES granted in February for imports of raw materials, production inputs, and agricultural and industrial equipment and spare parts to be financed with foreign currency obtained abroad, and private exporters were authorized in August to use up to 50 percent of their export proceeds to finance their raw material imports. Thailand allowed authorized agents to approve, on behalf of the exchange control officer, certain forms submitted by importers who paid by means other than opening letters of credit, provided that such importers had purchased the same goods from the same sellers with payments made in other means since the previous year. In Uganda, authorization was granted for im- porters to import specified types of capital goods on a consignment basis, subject to prior approval by the Bank of Uganda. In the Yemen Arab Republic, authorization was granted in February for importers to use their foreign currency balances with commercial banks before August 9, 1983 to finance import letters of credit. In Yugoslavia, it was determined in January that 10 percent of an enterprise's foreign exchange entitlement could be used as a downpayment on imports of equipment or for payments for spare parts. In Argentina, minimum financing terms were es- tablished in February for imports destined to the Special Customs Area of Tierra del Fuego, which were previously exempt from these requirements; on the other hand, imports from Peru and Brazil, and certain imports from Uruguay, were exempted from minimum financing requirements later in the year. Colombia reduced in November the minimum financ- ing periods for imports of intermediate products to 18 months with the exception of completely knocked- down parts, to which a one-year minimum financing period continued to apply. Other minimum financing periods for imports were established as follows: (i) 6 months after lading for raw material and consumption goods; (ii) for all remaining goods, up to 15 percent of the import value could be canceled within the first 6 months after lading; up to 30 percent within one year after lading; up to 60 percent within two years of lading; and the remaining amount thereafter. In Ecuador, minimum financing periods for the value of imports for which the importer had obtained foreign financing were reduced to 120 days for certain items in September, at the same time that prepayment of imports was prohibited, except for medicines. In Israel, provision of foreign exchange for import payments was permitted only against bills of lading and letters of credit, or for repayment of suppliers' credit. Imports of investment goods and motor vehi- cles were made subject until November 1—and later until August 1, 1985—to a foreign financing require- ment covering at least 75 percent of the f .o.b. value of the imported item and of average maturity of not less than 30 months. Imports valued at less than US$10,000 and certain investment goods and motor vehicles for commercial use were subsequently ex- empted from this requirement. Korea shortened in July the maximum period for import payments on a deferred basis from 120 to 90 days. Rwanda in July introduced a maximum financing term of 180 days from the date of shipment of the import. In February, the Yemen Arab Republic prohibited commercial banks from accepting foreign exchange deposits from individuals for the purpose of financing imports and from processing import documents unless payment was made through a particular bank. In addition, the customs authorities were prohibited from releasing goods unless the appropriate import documents were presented and stamped by a local bank. In May, a regulation was introduced specifying that before applying for an import license, importers should obtain prior endorsement by a commercial bank certifying that foreign exchange would be available to cover the associated letter of credit. Effective January 1, 1985, the franco valuta import system in Somalia, whereby imports were financed with foreign exchange held abroad, was discontinued and importers were required to process import docu- ments through the domestic banking system. State Trading As in recent years, there were few changes in members' state-trading practices in the period under review, including in one case a major decentralization of foreign trade operations. In the People's Republic of China, a reform of the foreign trade system was approved in September whereby exporters and im- porters would be able to choose freely, for all but a few commodities, their agents among licensed foreign trade entities other than the 14 national foreign trade corporations. In addition, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade (MOFERT) would no longer be involved in actual transactions, but would concentrate on the design, implementation, and moni- toring of overall policies; it is intended that the national foreign trade corporations will become in- creasingly independent accounting units. This reform became effective as of January 1, 1985. In Guinea, following the dissolution in May of IMPORTEX, a state- trading enterprise, private sector importers were au- thorized to import commodities for which IMPORTEX had previously enjoyed a monopoly. During 1984, Hungary granted permanent trading rights to seven additional enterprises, raising the total to 218 by the 25 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS end of the year. In October Morocco abolished the monopoly held by the Office of Marketing and Exports on exports of canned foods, while in February Pakistan allowed the exportation of rock salt by the private sector. On the other hand, in July India required that in future exports of steel produced by integrated steel plants, alloy steel plants, and second- ary producers and manufacturers be channeled through the Steel Authority of India. Exports and Export Proceeds Measures taken in 1984 affecting exports and export proceeds generally reflected the persistence of difficulties in trade relations among industrial coun- tries as well as continued efforts by developing countries to stimulate exports. Nevertheless, there was a tendency among the latter group of countries toward actions aimed at reducing special financial incentives. There were no major modifications in 1984 in the stance of the major trading countries as regards quantitative restrictions on exports. Quotas, bans, or embargoes on exports were abolished or relaxed in some countries. Among industrial countries, Japan announced in August a lowering of the minimum price permitted for exports of video tape recorders to the EC, which had been subject to restrictions since February 1983. The United States abolished in April controls on exports of measuring instruments equipped with microprocessors, except for certain destinations, and modified in September regulations governing exports of high-technology goods to the U.S.S.R. Among other countries, Korea removed in May controls on exports of herring roe, frozen mushrooms, crude oil and some oil derivatives, aluminum ingots, and amplifiers. India removed controls on exports of semiprecious stones in Febru- ary and on exports of most precious stones in August; restrictions on exports of a number of other goods were relaxed in April. Early in the year, Pakistan authorized, subject to quotas, exports of some food products, and Peru abolished export prohibitions for certain vegetables. Thailand lifted in March controls on exports of steel bars to Democratic Kampuchea, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and Viet Nam; later in the year, it relaxed controls on exports of iron rods, wildlife, brown sugar, maize, and teak products. A number of countries imposed new or tightened existing quantitative controls on exports. Japan agreed in June to add four more items to the list of textile 26 exports to the United States subject to restrictions during 1984—85, and agreed in December to limit the share in the U.S. market of Japanese steel producers to 5.8 percent; also in December, and in the context of the export restraint arrangement with the EC, it was agreed that exports of video tape recorders to that area were to be reduced to 2.25 million units in 1985, from 3.95 million units in 1984. In September the United States widened the scope of controls on exports of aircraft to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Among developing countries, Colombia imposed a ban on cocoa exports in May but abolished it in August. In India controls were tightened for a number of export products; in February quartz exports were prohibited and restrictions were imposed on exports of silk waste and other silk products; in April exports of forestry seeds, tallow fat or oil of animal origin, chloroquine sulphate, and some varieties of plants and derivatives were banned, and exports of synthethic musk, shells, and ambergris were restricted. Later in the year, bans were imposed on exports of some rough precious stones, rock crystal quartz and some magnesite products, and sugarcane and other sugar products. In Indonesia quotas for exports of certain types of textile products to specified countries were allocated in March among registered textile exporters, and in April exports of tobacco were restricted to those effected by registered tobacco exporters. Malaysia announced in June a ban on exports of timber logs from Peninsular Malaysia starting in 1985. South Africa imposed in April voluntary restraints on certain steel exports to the United States; early in 1985 these restraints were redefined, with effect from October 1, 1984, in the form of a five-year agreement between the two countries. Thailand imposed in October a temporary ban on jute exports. There were a few changes in regulations affecting export licensing. Among countries which relaxed export licensing requirements, Colombia issued in October simplified procedures for registration of exports. In the context of a program to liberalize exports in Morocco, the number of goods whose exportation remained subject to control was reduced in October. Somalia abolished at the beginning of 1985 licensing requirements and other controls on exports with the exception of those on specified items; in the latter case, exports were made subject to prior approval or became state monopolies. In some other countries, measures were aimed at tightening export registration procedures. The United States imposed in March, under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, licensing requirements for security rea- sons on exports and re-exports of a number of commodities as well as of certain technical data. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES Among developing countries, Bangladesh introduced registration requirements for jute exports in Novem- ber. In the People's Republic of China licensing requirements were extended to a number of textile exports in April, and a prior inspection requirement was introduced in March for all exports. In September Colombia limited the validity of coffee export con- tracts for the 1984/85 crop to not more than 45 calendar days, and Costa Rica began to restrict the issuance of licenses for exports to Nicaragua. In June Haiti subjected approval of exports to prior clearance of documentary drafts by the Bank of the Republic of Haiti (the central bank). There was a decline last year in the reliance on fiscal and other incentives as a means of promoting exports. In a few countries, however, the level of export subsidization rose noticeably. In August New Zealand extended the coverage of the Export Perfor- mance Taxation Incentive to all export destinations, although it was also announced that the system would be phased out by April 1, 1987. Argentina granted in October a tax rebate of 5 percent to exports to Equatorial Guinea. In March Colombia increased the maximum rate on tax reimbursement certificates granted to exporters from 20 percent to 25 percent of total export earnings, at the same time that a rate reduction was enacted for flower exports to the United States and Puerto Rico; in April the structure of rates on tax reimbursement certificates was raised from 5-25 percent to 15-35 percent in the case of exports to member countries of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA); although the rate applicable to cocoa exports was reduced in August, this measure was accompanied by further increases in rates applica- ble to some exports to the LAI A. India increased in January cash compensatory support for exports of leather garments and petrol kerosene engines. Later in the year, cash compensation was granted for exports of sodium cyanide and sail savers, and increased for exports of processed food items, marine products and marine freight containers, various jute products, guar gum, and frozen meat. In Peru export subsidies were extended to a number of agricultural products in January, and requirements for access to export sub- sidies were relaxed in May. While certain textile exports to the United States were removed in June from the list of products eligible for tax and credit subsidies, soon afterwards an overall increase in the level of export subsidization was enacted. A couple of countries adopted regulations reducing or eliminating fiscal subsidies on exports. Brazil adopted in Septem- ber a schedule for phasing out the export tax credit scheme by end-April 1985, and Thailand in May excluded certain items from the export tax scheme. Changes in export taxation were implemented by a number of countries. However, there was no general trend toward lowering or increasing the tax burden on exports, and most of the measures were aimed at shifting rates of taxation on specific commodities. Among countries in which export taxes were reduced in 1984, Canada enacted lower export levies on light crude oil in September. Among developing countries, Argentina lowered early in the year the tax on exports of wheat flour and uncorded cotton and eliminated the tax on exports of onions and citrus fruits. Haiti reduced the duty on coffee exports. In January Indonesia abolished the MPO tax on exports, a special tax which could be credited against the individual's or corporation's domestic income tax liability, and the 10 percent export tax on bauxite and its concentrate; this action was followed by the elimination in July of local government charges on exports of 11 different items and the export tax on unwrought tin. In Seychelles a 10 percent tax on exports and a special fee charged per package checked by customs officials were abolished in March. In Thailand the export levy on molasses was abolished in August, and later in the year exemptions from export duties were granted for a number of products. Uruguay reduced the rate of taxation of traditional export products from 10 percent to 8 percent in May and to 5 percent in October. Several developing countries imposed or increased taxes on specific export products in 1984. In Argen- tina, the tax rates on exports of soybean oil and meal, sunflower oil and other sunflower products, and unprocessed tobacco were raised during the year, although they were later reduced in the case of soybean meal and sunflower seed. Also, an additional export tax of 6 percent was imposed in October on all products subject to export tax; this tax was eliminated in December for wheat and wheat products and in early 1985 for most agricultural products. Brazil in March imposed export taxes on certain steel exports to the United States. The Gambia raised export duties on groundnut products in July. During the first half of the year India raised minimum export prices for tobacco, a number of food items, and sandal wood. In January, Indonesia raised the rate of the additional tax on exports of crude palm oil and crude stearin, subjected exports of treated stearin to the additional tax, and imposed a 5 percent export tax for crude palm oil and crude and treated stearin; later in the year, however, the additional export tax on crude palm oil was reduced back to nearly the rate prevailing in 1983, while the additional export tax on crude and treated stearin was first reduced and later eliminated. In addition, Indonesia imposed a tax on exports of wild animals and subjected exports of robusta and arabica 27 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS coffee to the additional export tax. In the Philippines an economic stabilization tax on all exports was introduced in June, but was abolished in October. Sri Lanka raised in February the duty on exports of tea. A few countries increased access of exporters to special credit facilities. Among industrial countries, France announced in July the establishment of two export funds, one for export loans and the other for the development of export firms. Within the group of developing countries, Argentina extended during the year the duration of special central bank credit lines to finance exports to a number of countries, increased available amounts under some of those lines, and opened a new credit line to finance exports to Guyana; in addition, a special refinancing regime established in late 1983 for meat packing firms which export more than 30 percent of their production was extended several times during the year. Colombia established in February a compensatory financing facility for cotton exports, and opened in April a special credit line for exports to Mexico; in September, a credit line was opened to finance training abroad of personnel in export-oriented firms, and debt relief was allowed under certain circumstances for export-oriented ag- ricultural firms. In Greece, domestic banks were allowed to provide financing for exports in foreign exchange. In Jamaica exporters were allowed in December to sell foreign exchange forward, and in the Philippines commercial banks were authorized since April to engage in export financing within guidelines. Reductions in the scope of credit facilities for exports were also limited. In New Zealand a government announcement in August that several suspensory loan schemes, including the Export Programme Sus- pensory Loan Scheme, would be terminated on March 31, 1985 was followed in September by the elimination of credit facilities aimed at assisting trading banks in the financing of postshipment re- quirements of exporters. In January Sweden raised lending interest rates for export credits extended in domestic currency by the national export credit agency. Within developing countries, Brazil raised the preferential interest rate applicable to preshipment credits in August, and Colombia reduced the scope of a special financing facility for flower exports. In Pakistan, a number of commodities became ineligible for concessionary export financing during the year. In the area of export or exchange guarantees, three countries modified regulations involving these schemes. In September, Japan relaxed for exports to some countries conditions for accepting export insur- ance. Argentina abolished in February the require- ment of central bank approval for the provision of guarantees by financial institutions in the case of 28 exports to foreign public sector entities. In India the Reserve Bank was authorized in April to allow exporters to substitute export orders in fulfillment of forward exchange contracts, provided that they were for the same commodity or commodities specified in the original export order, and only when the original order could not be executed for reasons beyond the control of the exporter. At the same time, the limit beyond which the cancellation of unutilized portions of forward exchange sale or purchase contracts by authorized dealers should be reported to the Reserve Bank was raised from the equivalent of US$500 to US$5,000. Requirements for the repatriation and surrender of export proceeds were modified in several countries, mostly in the direction of reducing official control over those receipts. Among countries in which repat- riation or surrender requirements were reduced, Italy extended in July the maximum period for deferred payment of exports without approval from the Italian Exchange Office to five years for exports to OECD countries (from 120 days in the case of non-EC countries), and to 360 days for exports to other countries. In addition, the maximum period permitted for residents to hold foreign exchange proceeds was increased in December from 7 days to 15 days, and from 15 to 30 days in the case of proceeds posted to so-called ordinary waiting accounts. Within devel- oping countries, Algeria in April authorized private exporters, as a means of promoting non-oil exports, to deposit in special accounts up to the equivalent of 4 percent of the repatriated value of exports. In March Colombia raised the maximum period for the repa- triation of noncoffee export receipts from Chile, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela by one year for exports registered prior to December 31, 1982, with the possibility of further one-year extensions when appli- cable. In Ecuador, the State Petroleum Corporation was exempted, beginning in June, from surrendering oil export proceeds up to an amount equivalent to payments abroad for services rendered by foreign oil companies. In El Salvador the Coffee Institute and the Association of Cotton Producers were authorized in February and May to sell part of coffee and cotton export proceeds at the parallel exchange rate; in addition, proceeds from exports of tuna fish to countries outside Central America were allowed to be converted at the parallel rate since May, and similar authorizations were granted in June and July for 80 percent of proceeds from shrimp exports and for exchange earnings by nontraditional exporters mar- keting part of their production outside Central America. In the context of the establishment of a three-tier exchange rate system in November, ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES Guatemala allowed exchange proceeds of certain exports to be surrendered at the banking market rate; at the same time, the maximum period allowed for the surrender of export proceeds was extended from three to six months. In March Mexico increased the maximum period allowed for surrendering export proceeds converted through the controlled market from 30 days to 75 days; also, the share of export proceeds which exporters were authorized to use for the settlement of obligations to foreign suppliers for debts contracted before December 20, 1982 was raised from 20 percent to 100 percent. In November the period allowed for surrendering export proceeds was extended to 90 days and the scope of exemptions from surrender requirements was expanded. Mozam- bique in May permitted private exporters to retain up to 20 percent of export earnings to finance their own imports of materials. On a number of occasions during the year, Nicaragua and Paraguay modified surrender requirements affecting exchange proceeds from specified exports by raising the share of such proceeds that could be converted at a more depre- ciated rate. In the Syrian Arab Republic a number of export items were permitted to be surrendered at the parallel rate. In both the Syrian Arab Republic and Zambia exporters were allowed to use up to 50 per- cent of export proceeds to finance their own import needs. A few countries intensified surrender requirements in 1984. In Argentina it was established in April that the surrender of export proceeds corresponding to exports effected on a deferred payments basis should include the amount charged as interest. Colombia increased the retention quota on coffee exports twice during the year. In addition, the period for surrender- ing exchange proceeds from noncoffee exports was reduced in October to five months from the date of shipment. Ecuador in September reduced the period for surrendering export proceeds from 45 days to 30 days after shipment for exports of coffee beans, bananas and other fruits, and unprocessed seafood products; from 75 to 60 days for exports of any remaining primary product; and from 360 to 180 days for all other exports. Commercial banks in Haiti were required in June to commence surrendering to the central bank 50 percent of exchange proceeds from all exports, instead of proceeds from major exports only, as was required previously. Paraguay shortened in June the period within which export proceeds should be surrendered, from 180 days to 120 days. In October exporters of traditional products in Peru ceased to be eligible to receive freely convertible exchange certificates for a portion of their foreign exchange earnings. In Sri Lanka exporters availing themselves of subsidized credit from the Central Bank were required in March to surrender their export proceeds on a forward basis at a freely determined rate; the maximum allowed duration of the forward contract, originally set at six months without excep- tion, was reduced in April to 21 days in the case of export payments with sight bills or letters of credit; finally, in May it was specified that all export proceeds exceeding the equivalent of SL Rs 500,000 were to be sold on a forward basis. Authorization to export in Venezuela became subject in February to the agreement to sell proceeds to authorized banks within a specified period. In Yugoslavia surrender require- ments were slightly increased at the beginning of 1984; from 40.0 percent of export proceeds in the first half of 1983 and about 52.7 percent after June, the statutory surrender requirements were raised to 54.1 percent of export proceeds in January 1984. Within this total, the portion allocated to the National Bank of Yugoslavia was raised considerably, while that allocated to republics and autonomous provinces was curtailed. With effect from the beginning of 1985, exporters in the People's Republic of China were permitted to retain a higher portion of their foreign currency earnings. Also, at the beginning of 1985 Somalia granted authorization to exporters to retain up to 65 percent of their proceeds in special accounts. Various other measures were implemented by countries in the period under review, generally with the intention of expanding exports or improving administrative procedures. In Finland, part of the proceeds from exports of pine sawn wood became subject in January to temporary deposit of 2.5 percent in the Suomen Pankki, earning interest at a rate of 8.75 percent per year; these requirements were ex- tended in June to a deposit of 3 percent for pulp exports, but in November they were discontinued for pine sawn wood exports. France in October simplified reporting requirements for exports with a value lower than the minimum amount subject to statistical re- cording (F 2,000). Among developing countries, Afghanistan began to require in January that 30 per- cent of proceeds from exports of raisins to the U.S.S.R. be obtained in U.S. dollars. Colombia in February modified regulations governing free trade zones both with the aim of promoting exports and in order to avoid the misuse of the zones as illegal ports of entry. Guinea in May transferred from IMPORTEX to the Ministry of Foreign Trade the power to issue export licenses and to establish annual export pro- grams. In India, regulations governing forward ex- change contracts and related export documentation were eased in April, and controls on foreign exchange 29 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS spot transactions were relaxed later in the year. In Indonesia, the collection of export taxes was trans- ferred in May from the foreign exchange banks to the Customs Office. In January Paraguay began to require exporters to liquidate their exchange proceeds in authorized banks in which the export documentation was completed or from which financing was obtained. Current Invisibles Regulations governing current invisibles were little changed on balance in 1984. As in previous years, most of the measures related to foreign exchange allocations for tourism and other travel abroad. Measures were also taken to some extent to affect payments for services performed by nonresidents such as remittances of royalties, consultancy fees, and expatriates' income, as well as imports and exports of bank notes and coins. All changes in regulations tightening current invisible transactions were underta- ken by developing countries, while modifications in industrial countries reduced or eliminated existing restrictions. Nevertheless, there were a number of developing countries that reduced or eliminated re- strictions on foreign exchange allocations for travel, medical expenses, or study abroad. Among industrial countries, France lifted in August prohibitions on residents' use of credit cards abroad that had been previously limited to business travel only. Iceland raised in April the basic foreign ex- change allocation for tourist travel from the equivalent of US$1,350 to US$1,500 per person per year. In May, Italy replaced the annual limit on foreign exchange allocation for tourist travel (which was the equivalent of Lit 1.6 million per person per year), by a limit allowing residents the equivalent of up to Lit 1.6 million per trip; in addition, residents traveling abroad were permitted to take with them up to Lit 200,000 per trip in local currency, or larger sums in the form of bank transfers in the case of duly documented expen- ditures. In December, the limit on the amount of domestic bank notes that tourists are allowed to take abroad was raised to Lit 400,000, and that of foreign bank notes, within the limit of foreign exchange allocation, was increased from Lit 300,000 to ECU 700. In addition, the use of credit cards to pay for tourist services was liberalized; previously not more than Lit 1.6 million could be charged on credit cards. In June, New Zealand increased the limits on sales of foreign exchange by banks without reference to the Reserve Bank from $NZ 1,000 to $NZ 3,000 per person per month; the limit for any 12-month period was also raised from $NZ 4,000 to $NZ 10,000 30 per person. In December these limits were abolished as part of a general relaxation of exchange controls. Norway abolished in June the limit of NKr 10,000 on purchases of foreign exchange for individual trips abroad. Among developing countries, Brazil raised in December the limit on sales of foreign exchange for travel abroad to US$1,000 per person, except for trips to, or initial stopovers in, Central America, in which case the limit is US$300 per person. Cyprus increased in August the foreign exchange allowance for studies abroad. In May, Ghana abolished the foreign ex- change foreign travel taxes and applied a processing fee of 5 percent ad valorem to purchases of airline tickets, and to purchases of foreign exchange for travel, medical expenses, education, and other private transfers, dues and subscriptions. Grenada raised, in October, the limits on foreign exchange sales for tour- ist and business travel from EC$3,000 and EC$7,000, respectively, to EC$5,000 and EC$ 10,000, respec- tively. In April India raised from the equivalent of Rs 200 to US$20 the limit on foreign exchange sales at airports and seaports to persons traveling to countries other than Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal, and in June allowed persons holding official or diplomatic passports to avail themselves of special travel schemes. In Hungary the foreign exchange allowance for travel outside the CMEA countries was raised in February and June; the amount of foreign currency that visitors could purchase was also raised. In June, Morocco raised the daily foreign exchange allowance for certain business travel from DH 750 to DH 1,000, and the overall limit from DH 10,000 to DH 15,000; in July, monthly and quarterly foreign exchange allocations for various categories of studies abroad were also increased. Pakistan increased, in January, travel allowances for business purposes to countries other than Afghanistan and India from US$130 to US$150 a day, raised the maximum limit per trip from US$3,900 to US$4,500, and increased the maximum amount of the annual education allow- ance from US$6,843 to US$7,073, while the minimum amount remained at US$4,199. In Portugal the foreign currency allowance for tourist travel was increased in August, and in October the Central Bank raised the ceilings on amounts of foreign exchange which authorized banks and licensing centers may sell without prior authorization. With effect from the beginning of 1985, Somalia raised foreign exchange allowances for travel and other purposes. Tunisia raised, in February, the annual ceilings on payments for travel expenditures from D 2,000 to D 4,000 a year for exporters of goods and services, and per- mitted such payments to be made by debiting foreign exchange retention accounts; in addition, provision ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES was granted for accumulating annual allocations for two consecutive years. In March, Tunisia eliminated the suspension applied since December 1976 to exchange allocations for residents traveling to Sicily. Western Samoa raised in December the daily limit of foreign exchange allowance from US$50 to US$100 for private travel by residents and expatriates, and to US$200 for business travel; the yearly ceiling of US$2,000 for private travel and of US$4,000 for business travel remained unchanged. In addition, the amount of foreign bank notes that residents could take out of the country as part of their overall travel allowances was set at the equivalent of US$500. In October, Yugoslavia increased the amount of local currency usable for travel abroad from Din 1,500 to Din 2,500 for first trips, and from Din 200 to Din 500 for subsequent trips during a year. Some developing countries tightened regulations governing foreign exchange allocations for travel, medical purposes, and studies abroad. In August, Bolivia prohibited residents from buying airline tick- ets directly and instead required the use of U .S. dollar checks made out to the order of airline companies; foreign exchange allowances for travel abroad were reduced, but the limits on sales of foreign exchange for medical expenses abroad were raised. Colombia reduced in March the foreign exchange allowance for travel abroad and increased the advance deposit on purchases of foreign exchange for travel purposes. Costa Rica raised in March the travel exit tax for all nationals or resident foreigners to the domestic cur- rency equivalent of US$10. In November, Guatemala reduced the foreign exchange allocation for tourist travel and prohibited its use other than to cover transportation costs. These restrictions were later abolished in the context of the establishment of a three-tier exchange rate system; at that time, foreign exchange requests for invisible payments other than official payments and registered private debt pay- ments were authorized through the banking market. Israel introduced several regulations affecting travel abroad. The foreign exchange allowance for residents traveling abroad was reduced from US$3,000 to US$2,000 per trip in January and to US$1,000 in October. In addition, the tax on citizens traveling abroad was doubled in March. The 15 percent value- added tax, which was replaced by the imported service tax of 15 percent in November, was extended to purchases of foreign exchange for foreign travel in Ju ly, and a compulsory one-year deposit of 15 percent payable in local currency was required in October on that part of foreign package tours covering payments for hotels, land transport, and other related services. The temporary suspension on the use of credit cards abroad by residents—announced in October 1984 as effective from January 1, 1985—was ended on Febru- ary 10, 1985. While allowing tourists departing the country to exchange local currency obtained from conversion at the time of entry, the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya required in April that a minimum of US$50 be spent for each day in the country. In July the transfer allowance for pilgrims was set at LD 700. In October the Central Bank of Malta announced that applications for foreign cur- rency for leisure travel to Italy were to be refused. In January Nigeria reduced basic travel allowances, suspended foreign exchange allocations for business travel, abolished foreign exchange allocations for medical purposes, except in certain circumstances, and discontinued the provision of foreign exchange for certain studies abroad. Moreover, in July the distribution of traveler's checks in Nigeria was cen- tralized at the Central Bank of Nigeria. Peru placed in March a limit of US$300 per trip on foreign exchange requests for travel abroad. Additional sums, up to an annual limit of US$8,000, could be provided in the form of documents drawn on a correspondent bank in the country of destination. Regulations were tightened further in October, when access to the unified ex- change market for tourism and business travel as well as for student and personal remittances was canceled. In December, the cancellation was extended to a number of other invisible payments. In June the Philippines imposed a travel tax of the equivalent in pesos of US$200 and US$120 each on first and economy class passengers, respectively; various re- duced rates were imposed on certain special categories of travelers which included, inter alia, contract workers, their spouses, and dependents aged 21 years or less. The travel tax on contract workers, their spouses, and dependents was reduced in Septem- ber and was finally abolished in October. In addition, the travel tax was redefined in October as £ 2,700 and £ 1,620 for first and economy class passengers, respectively; reduced rates of P 1,350 for first class passengers and P 810 for economy class passengers were to apply to special categories of travelers. Sao Tome and Principe in January tightened regulations on purchases of airline tickets for travel abroad and reduced foreign exchange allowances for medical purposes. Suriname reduced, in June and December, foreign exchange allowances for travel abroad. In March, Tunisia levied on residents traveling abroad by sea or air a new travel tax of D 30 a trip, but exempted nonresidents, students, pilgrims to Mecca, and travelers for medical reasons from the tax. In March, Zaire required that nonresident travelers take out, on departure, the amount declared on entry less 31 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS the equivalent of the expenses incurred during their stay in Zaire. Zimbabwe introduced in July a fee of 20 percent on the provision of foreign exchange for vacation purposes. Regulations governing outward transfers by resi- dents or payments for services rendered by nonresi- dents were changed in a few countries. Finland raised in January the maximum amount of foreign exchange allowed for individual Finnish emigrants from Fmk 250,000 to Fmk 300,000. In November, France raised the limit on outward transfers without support- ing documents from F 1,500 per person per quarter to F 1,500 per person per month. Among developing countries, the People's Republic of China in January permitted foreign and overseas Chinese staff members and workers as well as those from the Hong Kong and Macao regions to remit abroad more than 50 percent of their after-tax income. Colombia abolished, in September, the advance deposit on payments of import freight. In September Grenada liberalized regulations governing outward remittances for med- ical, educational, gift, and family maintenance pur- poses. Restrictions on outward remittances of profits, dividends, and insurance premiums were relaxed in October, and outward remittances of proceeds from sales of local property and legacies, royalties, and management fees were similarly relaxed in Novem- ber. Hungary raised in April the limit on the market value of gifts transferable abroad by residents without licensing to Ft 800 and the ceiling on gifts from nonresidents without being subject to licensing to Ft 25,000. In July, India increased limits on outward remittances of foreign exchange for certain services performed by nonresidents, including patent, trade- mark, or other fees, and Mexico permitted royalty payments to be made through the controlled exchange market. In April, Pakistan allowed foreign nationals working in Pakistan to remit abroad for family maintenance up to 50 percent of net income, or US$750 a month, whichever was higher. Western Samoa raised in December the limit on the amount that authorized banks could approve for transfer abroad as gifts to relatives and dependents from US$200 to US$250 per person per year. In Yugo- slavia the limit on the remittance of profits by foreign partners in joint enterprises was raised at the end of 1984, from the equivalent of one half of the enter- prise's foreign exchange earnings from exports of goods and services to the total of such earnings. A number of developing countries tightened regula- tions governing outward transfers by residents and payments for services rendered by nonresidents. Argentina tightened in June and November regula- tions governing transfers abroad by foreign transpor- 32 tation firms or their agents for transportation services and ticket sales or excess baggage charges paid in pesos argentinos. In August, the surrender require- ment for proceeds from freight and transportation services by Argentine carriers was extended to cover net services income by local enterprises with foreign flag or foreign-registered carriers. Colombia in- troduced exchange licensing requirements for pay- ments of commissions relating to certain exports, and limited in June freight and insurance payments eligi- ble for foreign exchange; in addition, barter, clearing, and triangular trade requirements were extended to payments abroad for services. In July, Israel sus- pended the previous allowance of up to the equivalent of US$2,000 per person per year for transfers by residents as gifts and support payments, and sus- pended until November 1, 1984, and again until August 1, 1985, permission for voluntary prepayment of foreign obligations by residents. The Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya reduced in January the transfer of income abroad by nonresident employ- ees of the state, state-owned enterprises, and foreign companies from 90 percent to 75 percent of net monthly salary in the case of those with provisions for free lodging and board, and from 60 to 50 percent for those without such provisions. In addition, nonresi- dents employed in the private sector were allowed to remit abroad up to 50 percent of their earnings subject to a monthly limit of LD 40 for those engaged in agricultural activities, and LD 60 for others. In January, Nigeria prohibited payments abroad for technical services or management fees except in certain circumstances, reduced allowances for remit- tances of consultancy fees, and tightened regulations governing remittances of proceeds from the sale of assets by expatriates; in addition, the proportion of expatriates' income that can be remitted was reduced from 50 percent to 25 percent in May. Suriname abolished in January outward transfers of gifts by residents, and tightened in February regulations gov- erning outward remittances by residents for support of family members. The Syrian Arab Republic adopted in March regulations requiring Syrian Arab nationals working inside the country and paid in foreign currencies to convert all such earnings at the official exchange rate. Syrian Government employees work- ing abroad were also required from that date to repatriate and convert at the tourist market rate at least 25 percent of their annual pay and allowances. In addition, foreign visitors were, with few exceptions, required to convert at least US$100 into local cur- rency upon entry at the tourist exchange rate, and to settle their hotel bills with the counterpart of foreign currency exchanged at the tourist exchange rate.

Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES March, Zimbabwe suspended all remittances of rental income, all remittances of dividends, branches and partnership profits, and income remittances from blocked funds, with the exception of dividends and profit remittances on venture capital that came in after September 1, 1979, and reduced the maximum set- tling-in allowance to be remitted abroad by emigrants to Z$ 1,000 per family unit; furthermore, in Ju ly a nonresidents' tax of 20 percent on royalties was introduced. Regulations affecting the import and export of foreign and domestic currency notes were changed in some countries. Finland lifted in January the prohibi- tion on the import and export of 500 markkaa notes, and raised the value of foreign exchange that can be freely exported from 5,000 markkaa to 10,000 mark- kaa per person per trip. In March Iceland raised the limit on export or import of Icelandic bank notes and coins, in denominations not exceeding ISK 100, by resident and nonresident travelers from ISK 2,100 to ISK 3,000. In June Norway abolished the previous limit of NKr 10,000 on Norwegian notes that travelers abroad could take with them. In March, Bangladesh raised the limit on the amount of foreign currency notes that could be imported without declaration to US$1,000 for nonresidents, and to US$750 for resi- dents. In Barbados exports of foreign currency notes and Barbados dollar notes were limited to the equiva- lent of BDS$500 and BDS$200, respectively. Cyprus abolished in June the limit on the amount of foreign currency notes that could be exported by residents traveling abroad. In India permission was given to residents in January to acquire foreign exchange from nonresidents visiting India in payment for goods and services, as long as holdings of foreign currency do not exceed the equivalent of US$100 and are surren- dered to the Reserve Bank within seven days of acquisition. In some countries, regulations governing currency notes were tightened. In Ju ly, Israel limited the export of domestic bank notes by residents traveling abroad to the equivalent of US$50 per person per trip. Nigeria reduced in May the amount of naira that may be imported or exported from N 50 to N 20. The Philippines established in May a limit of US$1,000 per person for the amount of foreign currency notes which outgoing residents may take with them. In September, Suriname required nonresi- dent travelers to exchange convertible currency in an amount equivalent to Sf 500 when entering the country by air and Sf 200 when entering by road. The local currency so purchased could be reconverted under certain conditions. The Syrian Arab Republic required since March that nonresident visitors settle their bills at certain hotels with the counterpart of foreign exchange exchanged at local banks, and also required non-Arab visitors to convert, upon entry into the country, US$100 into local currency. Finally, in May, the Yemen Arab Republic reduced the max- imum limit on domestic bank notes that could be taken out of the country from YR ls 100,000 to YR ls 50,000 and that of foreign currency notes from US$30,000 to US$15,000. Payments Arrears Payments arrears are attributable to a variety of causes; the Fund's data on members' payments arrears cover arrears that have been caused by exchange restrictions on current payments or transfers as well as arrears on financial obligations of which the obligor is the government or a resident in the country in question and which are overdue for balance of payments or fiscal reasons.5 An increase in arrears adversely affects the country's creditworthiness, with the result that access to normal means of financing is frequently curtailed. A further consequence is that the cost of international credit, as well as of imported goods and services, becomes higher than would otherwise be the case for most borrowers. In view of the particularly adverse consequences for the country maintaining arrears and for the international payments system, performance criteria for the elimination or substantial reduction of payments arrears in an orderly and nondiscriminatory manner constitute an important element of members' economic programs supported by the use of the Fund's resources.6 Moreover, the 5 Payments arrears evidence an exchange restriction under the Fund's Article VIII, Section 2(d) or Article XIV, Section 2 when the authorities of a country are responsible for undue delays in approving applications or in meeting bona fide requests for foreign exchange for current international transac- tions as defined in Article XXX (d). Accordingly, when a government or a government entity whose financial operations form part of the budgetary process fails to meet an external payments obligation due to a lack of domestic currency, the resulting arrears are considered to evidence defaults by the government rather than exchange restrictions. Similarly, ar- rears incurred by governments participating in a common central bank are treated as defaults when they are due to the government's inability to obtain domestic currency with which to purchase needed foreign exchange from the common central bank. Although these distinctions are relevant for the purposes of Articles VIII and XIV, in the context of the Fund's policies on the use of its resources, defaults and other forms of arrears involving current and capital payments are viewed as having the same broad macroeconomic character and consequences, and are therefore treated in the same manner. 6In March 1982 and in January 1983, the Fund reviewed the implementation of its policies with respect to payments arrears. The major conclusions of these reviews were summarized in 33 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS incurrence of arrears and related policies have been subject to careful scrutiny in the context of Article IV consultations with the Fund. The Fund has also consistently followed the practice of not approving under Article VIII, Section 2(a) of the Fund's Articles of Agreement exchange restrictions evidenced by arrears on current international payments, except when a satisfactory program for the elimination of the arrears is in place. In June 1984 the Fund's Executive Board discussed the role of the Fund in the settlement of disputes between members relating to external financial obli- gations. Also in the course of this discussion, aspects of Fund policies concerning external payments arrears were analyzed. The general conclusions of this review and of the review of developments in members' arrears, which took place in July 1984, were the following: (1) Policies and practices followed by the Fund with respect to its direct interest in members' overdue financial obligations stemming from the Fund's jur- isdiction under Article VIII and Article XIV of the Fund's Articles of Agreement were reaffirmed. In exercising its functions under Article VIII and Arti- cle XIV, the Fund must examine the context in which the nonpayment of a financial obligation has occurred in order to determine whether or not it involves an exchange restriction and, as such, is subject to Fund approval, and members are obliged to provide the information the Fund requires to make such a determi- nation at the time that the nonpayments occur. (2) Existing Fund policies and practices for dealing with the identification and treatment of payments obligations in arrears will also be continued. This includes the treatment of some categories of payments arrears that are not the result of exchange restrictions, such as payments arrears concerning capital transac- tions, as well as certain nonpayments by the member in the nature of defaults. In this respect, the Fund has come to expect that, at the time of approval of arrangements, there should be a reasonable assurance that the amount of external financing necessary to make the program sustainable would be available. This requirement is intended to ensure, as far as practicable, that available external financing will be adequate to support the member's balance of pay- ments adjustment program, so that the targeted reduc- tion in outstanding arrears as well as the avoidance of new ones can be realized. Normally, this requirement the Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions, 1983. The major conclusions of the most recent review in July 1984 of developments in arrears are reported below. 34 has implied that the member had to approach its creditors to consolidate its existing payments arrears and to reschedule its maturing debt service obligations before Fund approval of the arrangement. (3) For purposes associated with the financial aspects of adjustment programs, the Fund's approach of regarding the multilateral Agreed Minutes of the Paris Club as satisfying the requirement for debt relief from official creditors and as a basis for considering associated payments arrears as eliminated will con- tinue. Since the Paris Club now stipulates a final date for concluding the bilateral agreements, the Fund would normally regard the failure to conclude the bilateral agreement by the stipulated date as entailing payments arrears for purposes of the member's Fund- supported program; however, the debtor's right to make further purchases under an arrangement would not be interrupted if, in the judgment of the Fund, the delay in reaching an agreement occurred despite exercise of the debtor's best efforts. The Fund will continue to approach these matters on a case-by-case basis. (4) In the light of the importance which the prompt fulfillment by members of their international financial obligations has for the functioning of the international monetary system, the Fund has a direct interest in the settlement of overdue obligations and a role to play in accordance with the Articles of Agreement. The Fund will continue to help members to improve their statistical base and to increase the supply of informa- tion on their external financial obligations, particu- larly with respect to overdue claims. Given the complex circumstances typically surrounding overdue financial obligations and the important differences existing among individual cases, the Fund will con- tinue to fulfill its responsibilities under the Articles of Agreement on a case-by-case basis within the context of present policies and procedures, which are them- selves expected to continue to evolve. (5) In the light of the Fund's primary respon- sibilities concerning the international monetary sys- tem and of its specific authority under the Articles of Agreement to provide financial and technical ser- vices, Fund management and staff will stand ready to use their good offices in helping members engaged in a particular dispute over an external financing obliga- tion, consistent with available resources. Their role will be substantially technical in nature. The Fund will remain neutral in issues of debt disputes, and will act in such cases only if both parties wish to have the Fund provide the good offices. During 1977-81, the total payments arrears of Fund members (including those in respect of capital trans- actions and government defaults) had remained rela- ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES lively constant, amounting to between SDR 5 billion and SDR 7 billion, but, by the end of 1982, reflecting widespread balance of payments difficulties, they almost quadrupled to SDR 23 billion and increased further to SDR 29 billion by the end of 1983. According to the latest information available, the total of payments arrears incurred by Fund members is estimated to have risen further to SDR 43 billion at the end of 1984. In the last several years the number of Fund members incurring payments arrears had been rising continuously, reaching 46 in 1983. This trend was somewhat reversed in 1984, as the number declined to 44 by the end of the year. Of the 55 Fund members incurring payments arrears at some point during 1976-84, only 11 have managed to eliminate them. Of the remaining countries, 8 experienced virtually continuously rising arrears in recent years, whereas only 2 countries demonstrated a steady decline. Of the 44 countries incurring, or believed to be incurring, external payments arrears or government defaults at the end of 1984, information for the end of 1984 is available for the following 43 countries: Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Belize, Benin, Bolivia, the Central African Republic, Chad, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, The Gambia, Ghana, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Honduras, Ivory Coast, Jamaica, Liberia, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines, Somalia, Sudan, Suriname, Tanzania, Uganda, Venezuela, Viet Nam, Western Samoa, Zaire, and Zambia. In addition, data for the end of June 1984 are available for Sierra Leone. During 1984, payments arrears or government defaults were eliminated in Brazil, the Congo, Mex- ico, St. Lucia, and Togo. In one country, Suriname, payments arrears or government defaults emerged in 1984 for the first time since 1976. In two other countries payments arrears or government defaults emerged again in 1984; of these countries, Egypt had eliminated them in 1978 and Somalia in 1982. In the course of 1984, of the countries that had payments arrears or government defaults at the end of 1983, the outstanding amount rose, or arrears were introduced, in 28 countries (Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Belize, Benin, Bolivia, Chad, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, The Gambia, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea, Guyana, Honduras, Mauritania, Morocco, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines, Sudan, Tanzania, Venezuela, and Viet Nam) and declined in 13 countries (the Central African Re- public, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Jamaica, Liberia, Madagascar, Mali, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Western Samoa, Zaire, and Zambia). During 1984, the debts of 24 Fund members were rescheduled or refinanced; in addition, negotiations were under way with three Fund members. The following 15 countries incurring external arrears as of the end of 1984 were involved in these restructuring exercises in 1984: Argentina, Ecuador, Guyana, Honduras, Ivory Coast, Jamaica, Madagascar, Morocco, Nicaragua, Peru, the Philippines, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Venezuela, and Zambia. Excluding agreements in principle, the total of payments obliga- tions for which rescheduling agreements were signed in 1984 is estimated to have amounted to SDR 22.5 billion; the total was close to SDR 60 billion in 1983. Of the rescheduling in 1984, over SDR 11 billion was in respect of debt service payments already in arrears or falling due in 1984. The restructurings were aimed at helping countries achieve a more sustainable balance of payments and reserves position by improv- ing the maturity structure of the external debt profiles and by regularizing outstanding external arrears, while adjustment programs aimed at strengthening the balance of payments were implemented. At the end of 1984, adjustment programs supported by stand-by or extended arrangements, all in the higher credit tranches, were in effect in the following 16 countries that were identified as incurring pay- ments arrears or government defaults: Argentina, Belize, the Central African Republic, the Dominican Republic, The Gambia, Ghana, Grenada, Ivory Coast, Jamaica, Liberia, Peru, the Philippines, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Western Samoa, and Zambia. All programs provided for a phased reduction or elimina- tion of payments arrears or government defaults during a specified period as a performance criterion. Eight of these countries reduced payments arrears or government defaults during 1984. In a number of adjustment programs, a counterpart deposit require- ment in local currency was introduced as a means of maintaining a reliable record on payments arrears and of monitoring the bona fides of foreign exchange applications. Such deposit requirements also helped effect an orderly elimination of payments arrears by ensuring that domestic debtors had sufficient financial resources when foreign exchange was released, and also served as a means of moderating liquidity expansion. In a number of instances, monetary au- thorities paid interest on such deposits or guaranteed the exchange rate to be applied at settlement so as to avoid the possible emergence of a multiple currency practice. In instances where the monetary authorities assumed the obligations, such exchange rate guaran- tees were effectively and automatically provided. 35 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS Multiple Currency Practices Article VIII, Section 3 of the Fund's Articles of Agreement prohibits a member from engaging in, or permitting its fiscal agencies to engage in, any discriminatory currency arrangements or multiple currency practices without the approval of the Fund.7 Such practices encompass separate exchange rates (for example, through the mechanism of dual or multiple exchange markets, the establishment of separate official exchange rates for specified transac- tions or the application of exchange measures, includ- ing exchange taxes or subsidies, and wide exchange rate spreads), broken cross rates, or discriminatory currency arrangements. The Fund approves multiple currency practices only when a well-conceived plan to bring about the unification of the exchange rate system during a specific and relatively short period of time is in place. In many instances, the staff assists the authorities to formulate such a plan, especially in the context of adjustment programs supported by the use of Fund resources. In April 1984 and February 1985 the Executive Board reviewed the Fund's experience and policies with respect to multiple exchange rate regimes. The main conclusions of these reviews can be summarized as follows: (1) Reflecting widespread balance of payments difficulties, a temporary reversal in the period 1980- 82 of the long-run trend toward reduced resort by Fund members to multiple exchange rate regimes had occurred. In the mid-1950s some two thirds of all members, representing one third of members' trade, had such regimes. In June 1957, the Fund adopted an important decision urging members to simplify their exchange rate structures; it also undertook to assist members in their efforts to do so, providing technical assistance where appropriate. In the late 1950s and early 1960s these efforts, together with the establish- ment of convertibility among major countries and an improvement in the international trade situation, contributed to a substantial simplification of exchange rate systems in both developed and developing coun- tries. Progress in simplifying developing countries' systems was, however, mixed thereafter, with in- creased use by these countries in the late 1960s, and again in the early 1980s. Also, practices newly 7For a detailed description of Fund policies relating to multiple currency practices, in particular, the criteria applied by the Fund for determining the existence of multiple currency practices and broken cross rates subject to Article VIII of the Fund's Articles of Agreement, see the Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions, 1980, page 17, and 1981, pages 22-23. 36 adopted by members in the 1980s tended to take the form of dual or multiple exchange rate systems of relatively large scope. (2) Fund members have adopted multiple rate regimes for a number of reasons but most frequently they were introduced as a temporary alternative to a straightforward uniform exchange rate adjustment. This was typically the case when the currency depreciation that would be required was seen by the member as too costly from a political and social perspective, in particular in its effects on the prices of certain important commodities. Multiple exchange rate systems were also found to have been adopted in response to the volatility of capital flows or more frequently to one-way pressures on capital account, particularly during periods of exchange rate uncertain- ties. A third important category of dual rate systems has been those setting up preferential rates for external debt service payments on debts contracted up to a certain date with the aim of alleviating the financial position of certain industries. (3) Whatever the arguments for adopting a multi- ple rate system, the experience with their operation has shown a number of common features. The first is that they tend to become a long-lasting aspect of members' exchange arrangements. The second fea- ture is that the multiple rate system did not often produce the desired result or if it did, the result was achieved at a high economic cost. In a number of instances, the availability of subsidized commodities or financing at the preferential rate was reflected in black market operations, with the final consumer paying the equivalent of the equilibrium exchange rate price. In the majority of cases where the system was introduced as a buffer for capital speculation, the spread between the free and official market rates raised doubts as to the continued viability of the official market and the authorities therefore inter- vened in the free market to limit or even to prevent the depreciation of that rate. A further characteristic is the complex legislation and numerous modifications that have marked resort to multiple rate regimes. In short, the experience showed that multiple rate systems are costly in terms of efficiency and in resource alloca- tion, and have not proven conducive to medium-term balance of payments adjustment. (4) Executive Directors were of the view that Fund policies in the area of multiple exchange rates should remain flexible, pragmatic, and responsive on a case- by-case basis to each country's particular circum- stances. The most important judgment to be made when deciding on the approval of multiple exchange rate systems relates to their temporary character. Fund approval of these practices is based on the existence of ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES a well-conceived plan designed to bring about the unification of exchange rates over a specific and appropriately brief period of time. The development of such plans and the search for firm commitments to eliminate multiple rates should be expected from members undertaking adjustment programs supported by the use of Fund resources. The plan should normally consist of successive reductions in exchange rate spreads or shifts in the transactions undertaken in the various exchange markets. In cases where no arrangement entailing the use of Fund resources is in effect, approval of multiple exchange rates is granted when there are firm indications of measures and conditions considered likely to ensure their temporary nature. In the context of a subsequent discussion in early 1985 on multiple currency practices applicable solely to capital transactions, the Executive Board did not take a view on the question of Fund jurisdiction over these practices under Articles VIII and XIV, leaving the matter open for further consideration. At the same time, it was agreed that members should continue to provide the Fund with specific and full information on capital controls and multiple currency practices appli- cable solely to capital transactions, and that the Fund will continue to assess the economic consequence of such practices in the context of its surveillance activities. The experience of the Fund membership with regard to practices that segment foreign ex- change markets precisely on the basis of current and capital transactions has been limited; only six coun- tries presently maintain multiple currency practices that are identified as relating solely to capital transac- tions. In most of these instances, these practices have not taken the form of a separate exchange rate for capital flows in general, but rather for specific components of the capital account, and they have served as an adjunct, and not as an alternative to, quantitative controls on other forms of capital transac- tions. Furthermore, the spreads have generally been maintained at a more or less steady depreciated rate over extended periods of time, or have varied mainly in response to nonbalance of payments factors, or were subject to infrequent discretionary change, all of which indicate that these practices have played a limited "buffering" role for variations in capital movements. The trend since 1980 toward the increased use of multiple currency practices by Fund members noted in the 1984 Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions was reversed in 1984, as 11 members eliminated or simplified multiple cur- rency practices (Argentina, Ecuador, Egypt, El Sal- vador, Indonesia, Paraguay, Rwanda, Sudan, Uganda, Yugoslavia, and Zaire), while six members introduced multiple currency practices, or made the practices more complex (Bolivia, Colombia, Guatemala, Israel, Peru, and Venezuela). During the period under review five members eliminated multiple currency practices. Indonesia, in January, abolished the MPO tax on exports, and in May, changed the collection procedures of the export surcharge and the additional export surcharge so as to abolish the multiple currency practice feature. In July Rwanda eliminated the features in the advance import deposit requirement which had given rise to a multiple currency practice. In June Uganda replaced the dual exchange rate system with a unified exchange rate system under which the weekly exchange rates are determined by auction administered by the Bank of Uganda. Yugoslavia, in February, eliminated the multiple currency practice feature in a scheme which entitled foreign tourists to a 10 percent discount on goods and services when paying in dinar checks issued by the National Bank of Yugoslavia. Zaire unified the free and interbank market exchange rates in February. During 1984 six members simplified multiple cur- rency practices. Argentina reduced in October export rebates by 6 percentage points. In February Ecuador transferred to the intervention market of the Central Bank additional export transactions and all service receipts and payments, with the exception of those for interest payments on foreign debt, profit remittances of registered foreign investments, and a few minor service transactions. In the course of 1984, Egypt took several measures aimed at a gradual unification of the commercial bank pool and the free market pool; on the other hand, the central bank pool, through which a large share of current transactions take place at an exchange rate of LE 0.7 = US$1, was not affected by these measures. In February, public sector banks were allowed to purchase foreign exchange at the premium rate of LE 1.12 = US$1 from the domestic market as well as from abroad. In March the permission to purchase foreign exchange at the pre- mium rate, without restriction on the source of the funds, was extended to all commercial banks. In April all commercial banks were authorized to effect at a premium rate of LE 1.18 = US$1 virtually all of their sales of foreign exchange to public sector entities with authorizations in the foreign exchange budget and to private importers of industrial inputs and construction materials. On May 5, the spread between the premium buying and selling rates was reduced to 4.4 percent through a reduction in the latter rate to LE 1.17 = US$1 (the premium exchange rates are set by a seven-member committee). In El Salvador, a number 37 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS of transactions were shifted from the official exchange market to the parallel exchange market, effective December 3, 1984, establishing a new mixed ex- change rate based on 50 percent of the value of the official exchange rate and 50 percent of the value of the parallel exchange rate. Payments for 100 percent of the value of a number of consumer goods imports were shifted to the parallel market, together with payments for 50 percent of the value of certain imports of intermediate goods. At the same time, 50 percent of the proceeds from most exports to the rest of Central America were transferred to the parallel market. With these changes, the special preferential rate for certain imports of goods and services from the rest of Central America was elimi- nated. With effect from February 22 the official exchange rate in Paraguay, which was used for the transfer abroad of proceeds from air freight charges and domestic sales of air transportation tickets, was depreciated by 47 percent from 0 300 = US$1. In addition, on March 9 the mixing exchange rate applied to the surrender of export receipts was devalued, and the exchange rate regime applicable to exports was simplified. In May, the regime was further simplified as a rate of 0 160 = US$1 was made applicable to most official transactions; ex- port receipts, along with certain registered private sector capital transactions and specified import payments, could be transacted at a rate of 0 240 = US$1; and all other transactions could take place at a rate determined in the free market. The resulting depreciations ranged from 13 percent in the case of exports to more than 30 percent for most imports. Sudan depreciated the commercial bank exchange rate from LSd 1.80 to LSd 2.10 per U .S. dollar, effective October 21, 1984. At the same time, all exports, with the exception of cotton and gum arabic, were valued at the commercial bank foreign exchange rate, rather than at the previous rate that was a composite of 75 percent of the official market rate and 25 percent of the commer- cial bank rate. The effective depreciation for these exports was thus 48 percent (from LSd 1.42 to LSd 2.10 per US$1). The 75:25 composite rate (now LSd 1.50 per US$1) continues to be applied to exports of cotton and gum arabic. In addition to these changes, export receipt surrender require- ments were partly liberalized. Under the new system, 50 percent of foreign exchange receipts from exports must be surrendered to the Bank of Sudan, compared with 75 percent under the previ- ous system. The liberalization does not apply, however, to cotton or gum arabic and a 100 percent surrender requirement applies to sesame. All im- 38 ports of goods under commodity aid agreements,- including wheat and wheat flour have been valued since the beginning of the fiscal year at the commercial bank rate rather than at the official rate or at composite rates as has previously been the case. All future commercial purchases of both wheat and sugar are to be financed in the free exchange market. In addition, all invisible pay- ments and receipts previously transacted in the official market have been transferred to the com- mercial bank market. The commercial bank rate is now applied to most capital inflows for investment purposes, and to receipts from tourism as well as to all government payments for invisibles except debt service. Six member countries introduced or intensified existing multiple currency practices in 1984. Bolivia introduced a number of changes in the course of 1984 that represented an increase in the complexity of the exchange system. In June, Bolivia increased the tax on the sale of foreign exchange from the equivalent of 1.8 percent to 4.8 percent; furthermore, effective August 17, Bolivia announced the introduction of a multiple exchange rate system consisting of five rates: (1) an "essential" exchange market with a preferential selling rate of $b 2,000 = US$1 plus a 4 percent tax and commissions of 0.5 percent each for the Central Bank and the intermediating bank applied to payment of essential imports. Thirty percent of the net value of export receipts surrendered to the Central Bank could be used to pay for imports of inputs and capital goods and the remaining 70 percent was to be settled at the "essential" exchange rate of $b 2,000 = US$1; (2) a "complementary" exchange market with rates of $b 5,000 = US$1 (buying) and $b 5,250 = US$1 (selling) applicable to other purchases and sales of foreign exchange for payment of nonessential im- ports; (3) a third "parity" exchange rate which was to be set fortnightly by the Ministry of Finance. The difference between the "parity" rate and the "essen- tial" rate on 70 percent of the value of exports was to be remitted to the exporter in the form of export exchange credit certificates (CERCEX) expressed in Bolivian pesos; after 90 days, these were to be converted into gold savings certificates (see below). The CERCEX system was never implemented; (4) a rate for gold savings certificates. These certificates were to be sold and redeemed in local currency at a gold price based on the price of gold in the London Metal Exchange. These freely negotiable and transfer- able certificates were to have a redemption period of four years and yield interest at LIBOR, payable every six months in local currency, and their issue was to be initially limited to the equivalent of 50,000 ounces of ©International Monetary Fund.

These dollar savings certificates were to be redeemed in U.S. dollars within a six-year maturity and yield interest at LIBOR, payable every six months in U.S. dollars.9 Airline tickets could only be purchased with U.S. dollar checks bought at the "complementary" rate. In November a single exchange rate of $b 8,571 = US$1 (buying) and $b 9,000 = US$1 (selling) replaced the previous five-tier exchange rate regime; separate exchange rates of $b 15,300 = US$1 and $b 17,500 = US$1 were applied, respectively, to the purchase of airline tickets and to the conversion of exchange receipts of the mining sector. In March, Colombia established new tax credit certificate rates (TCC) at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 percent and introduced geographical discrimination in the form of different incentive rates for the same product according to its destination (in April TCC rates for exports to LAIA countries were set at 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 percent). In March, the amounts of advance deposits required to be made prior to purchase of foreign exchange for travel was increased from Col$50 per U.S. dollar to Col$65 per U.S. dollar. Guatemala in November adopted a three-tier exchange rate system consisting of: (1) an official rate of Q 1 = US$1 applicable to most exports, all official transactions, and "essential" imports; (2) a rate determined in an "auction" market administered by the Bank of Guatemala for specified imports; and (3) a banking market rate applicable to other transactions not eligible for the other rates. At the time of the introduction of the multiple exchange rate system, the value of the quetzal in the secondary market was around Q 1.45 = US$1. Also in November, Israel introduced a 15 percent tax on imported services that is collected at the time of foreign exchange sales. In Peru a multiple currency practice was made more complex late in 1984 when access to the unified exchange market for most invisible payments was canceled. Venezuela added, effective February 24, a fourth tier to its previous three-tier system, which now consists of: (1) an exchange rate of Bs 4.30 per U.S. dollar applicable to priority transactions; (2) an exchange rate of Bs 6.00 per U.S. dollar for petroleum and iron ore transac- tions; (3) an exchange rate of Bs 7.50 per U.S. dollar 8Before the Central Bank started issuing gold and U.S. dollar-denominated certificates, the exchange rate regime was modified. 9Before the Central Bank started issuing gold and U.S. dollar-denominated certificates, the exchange rate regime was modified. for all other transactions approved under the exchange control system; and (4) a free market rate applicable to the remaining transactions. In March, Zaire in- troduced a minimum mandatory deposit requirement at the rate of 50 percent against letters of credit; in May, the deposit rate was raised to 65 percent but was reduced again to 50 percent in November. In early 1985, three members eliminated multiple currency practices. Effective January 1, when it joined the BEAC, Equatorial Guinea eliminated the multiple currency practices arising from taxes on transfers of net investment income, on interest pay- ments on foreign loans used for direct investment, and on general expenses remitted by branches and sub- sidiaries of foreign companies. Also with effect from January 1, the People's Republic of China abolished the internal settlement rate that was applied to all trade and related transactions. Mauritania eliminated all broken cross rates effective February 15 as the exchange rate of the ouguiya against the U .S. dollar was devalued by 16 percent from UM 67.15 = US$1 to UM 80.0 = US$1. In four other countries multiple currency practices were simplified in early 1985. Bolivia devalued the exchange rate of the peso by 81 percent from $b 8,571 = US$1 to $b 45,000 = US$1 for foreign exchange purchases in the official exchange market by the Central Bank and commercial banks, effective February 11. At the same time, the Central Bank began applying new selling rates of $b 49,550 = US$1 to commercial banks and $b 50,000 = US$1 to the general public, compared with $b 8,995 and $b 9,000 per US$1 previously. With effect from January 23, 1985 the previously existing dual exchange markets were unified in the Dominican Republic and all foreign exchange transac- tions began to be carried out at market-determined exchange rates, with the exception of transitional arrangements for which the peso counterpart had already been deposited with the Central Bank and certain other transactions that had already been autho- rized by the Central Bank; in addition, a "windfall" surcharge was introduced on exchange proceeds gen- erated from exports of goods and services except tourism. On February 8, 1985, Nicaragua eliminated mixing exchange rates for export proceeds and in- troduced new, more depreciated, exchange rates for most transactions. An exchange tax applicable to certain import payments was eliminated in December 1984. Sudan adjusted the official exchange rate for the Sudanese pound effective February 12 from LSd 1.3 = US$1 to LSd 2.5 = US$1, representing a 48 percent depreciation. Transactions conducted through the official market were enlarged to include certain export proceeds and import payments prev- 39 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS iously channeled through the commercial bank mar- ket. The commercial bank rate was initially set at LSd 3.0 = US$1, and on March 23 the Bank of Sudan allowed commercial banks to set independently their own buying and selling rates for foreign curren- cies in the free market. By the end of the first quarter, the rate had depreciated to LSd 3.48 = US$1. In early 1985, one member intensified existing multiple currency practices. Effective February 18, Paraguay reintroduced a system of minimum export prices denominated in U.S. dollars (aforos) as the basis for surrender and conversion of all export proceeds. Also effective that date, a fourth exchange rate of 0 400 = US$1 was made applicable to 50 percent of export proceeds based on minimum export prices. In Egypt, a number of measures were taken in January 1985 with the objective of unifying the commercial bank pool and the free market pool, but in April they were rescinded. Bilateral Payments Arrangements and Countertrade Practices Bilateral payments arrangements maintained be- tween Fund members constitute practices subject to Article VIII of the Fund's Articles of Agreement when they involve exchange restrictions or multiple currency practices. A basic feature of bilateral pay- ments arrangements, which gives rise to a restriction on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions within the meaning of Arti- cle VIII, Section 2(a), is that balances in the bilateral account, which is typically established to settle bilateral trade transactions, can be used only to make settlements between the two partner countries and cannot be transferred into another currency, or be used to make payments to a third country. Even in agreements in which the transferability of balances in the bilateral account is permitted, an exchange restric- tion may be involved if the period between transfers is unduly long. A multiple currency arrangement within the ambit of Article VIII, Section 3 of the Fund's Articles will be involved if settlements of balances are effected at exchange rates whose cross-rate differen- tials exceed more than 1 percent. In September 1982 the Executive Board reviewed the Fund's policy with respect to bilateral payments and countertrade ar- rangements. The conclusions of that review were summarized in the Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions, 1983 (pages 44 45). 40 The 1984 Annual Report on Exchange Ar- rangements and Exchange Restrictions noted that in 1983 there was a further decline in the number of bilateral payments arrangements (including inopera- tive agreements) maintained between Fund members, while the number of bilateral payments arrangements maintained between Fund members and non-Fund members remained unchanged at the 1982 level. As a result, at the end of 1983 the total number of bilateral payments agreements maintained between Fund mem- bers was 53, down from 62 at the end of 1982, while the total number of those maintained between Fund members and non-Fund members was 84. During 1984, progress in reducing bilateralism in payments arrangements continued, as one bilateral payments agreement maintained between Fund mem- bers was terminated, the number of such agreements between Fund members and non-Fund members re- mained unchanged, and no new agreements were concluded between Fund members, or between Fund members and non-Fund members. In March 1984, a payments agreement between Afghanistan and Hun- gary was terminated. Finland renewed in September its bilateral payments agreement with the U.S.S.R. for the period 1986-90. Pakistan renewed its bilateral payments agreements with the Islamic Republic of Iran and two non-Fund members (Bulgaria and Po- land). Consequently, as of the end of 1984, the total number of agreements between Fund members de- clined to 52, and that of agreements between Fund members and non-Fund members remained un- changed for the second consecutive year at 84. Detailed information on the value of trade con- ducted under bilateral payments is not available for most Fund members maintaining such arrangements. On the assumption that the value of trade between Fund members maintaining bilateral payments agree- ments represents the maximum value of trade con- ducted under bilateral payments arrangements, the total value of such trade was equivalent to about Vfe of 1 percent of the value of world trade of Fund members in 1983. It is most likely that the value of trade conducted under bilateral payments arrangements is considerably lower than the above ratio suggests, because all trade between Fund members maintaining bilateral payments arrangements is not usually settled under the arrangements; in many instances, only the trade of a group of products specified in an accom- panying trade agreement is settled under bilateral payments arrangements. On the other hand, in some cases nontrade transactions are also effected through the bilateral clearing accounts. In recent years, as noted in the 1983 and 1984 issues of the Annual Report on Exchange Ar- ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES rangements and Exchange Restrictions, there has been a growing resort in some countries to trading practices known as countertrade arrangements. Such types of arrangements have taken a variety of forms, but basically they are barter or quasi-barter ar- rangements between private firms and/or government entities, such as foreign trade organizations, under which the seller is obligated to accept specified goods or services from the buyer. Even though countertrade arrangements are for the most part carried out by private firms without official intervention, several countries have recently issued guidelines to be fol- lowed by individual entities while engaging in countertrade, or regulations making countertrade mandatory for certain international transactions. In early 1984 Colombia instituted a mandatory barter system for the importation of certain goods. Ecuador introduced in late 1982 compulsory options of minimum financing or barter trade for imports. Also in 1982, Indonesia issued regulations requiring foreign firms bidding for government-sponsored con- struction or procurement projects to agree to fulfill a counterpurchase obligation. In Israel foreign suppliers to the public sector must purchase Israeli products worth a certain proportion of the value of the contracts they receive, and in Malaysia guidelines specifying export and import commodities that would be consid- ered in countertrade arrangements have been in existence since 1982. In Peru a countertrade commit- tee was established in December 1984 to promote exports under barter and similar arrangements. The re-emergence of and recent growth in counter- trade have been attributed to several factors. In the centrally planned Eastern European countries, countertrade is often seen as helpful to the central planning process by reducing the uncertainties for the domestic production plan that result from the diffi- culty in forecasting foreign demand. It is also a means of achieving bilateral balancing of trade, which is an important objective of foreign trade policy in most of these countries. Shortages of convertible foreign exchange and the desire to stimulate the inflow of technology from abroad have also motivated Eastern European countries to enter into countertrade ar- rangements. Countertrade has increasingly been re- sorted to in developing countries in recent years for a variety of reasons. The recent balance of payments difficulties of several developing countries arising from sluggish export growth and a rising external debt service burden have led these countries to seek new ways of economizing scarce foreign exchange re- sources. The pressures to find markets for surplus goods or the difficulties of gaining access to the markets of the industrial countries for certain primary and/or manufactured products have also prompted some to enter into countertrade arrangements that commit industrial country exporters to purchasing a given quantity of products over a specified period. In certain cases, countertrade in the form of buy-back arrangements is seen—by both industrial and the more advanced developing countries—as a means of secur- ing reliable sources of essential raw materials while exporting equipment and technology that have be- come outdated at home. In other cases, countertrade may have become the only way for exporters (includ- ing those in industrial countries) to overcome the protective trade policies of some countries. Despite the recent proliferation of countertrade arrangements, reliable estimates of trade conducted under such arrangements are not available as they are most often concluded by individual firms without the knowledge and requirement of the government, or in instances where governments require or engage in countertrade and strategic goods are involved, de- tailed trade data are not published. Moreover, countertrade in the form of buy-back arrangements, which are perhaps the most prevalent and involve a relatively large volume of trade, often extend over several years, making it difficult to estimate the annual volume of trade. Global countertrade in 1980 was estimated to have reached roughly about 1 per- cent of world trade. A more recent estimate would be as high as 5 percent to 10 percent of world trade. Although the volume of trade conducted under countertrade arrangements appears to be small in relation to world trade, the proliferation of such practices is detrimental to the maintenance of the multilateral system of trade and payments. Counter- trade practices may entail many of the undesirable restrictive and discriminatory practices traditionally associated with bilateralism. Where countertrade practices result from a direct governmental limitation on the use or availability of exchange as such, they entail exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices that may be subject to approval under Arti- cle VIII of the Fund's Articles of Agreement. Even though countertrade practices may be viewed as having some advantages, such as access to restricted markets, or in some circumstances implicit valuation of exports at a more depreciated exchange rate, they have a number of shortcomings. Apart from the basic issue of inefficiency of resource allocation, some of the more common serious disadvantages generally encountered are: (1) a limited choice of products or services that are available for trading at internationally competitive prices; (2) poor quality of goods; (3) the difficulty of marketing products that are not directly consumed by the buyer, especially when the seller 41 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS places geographical or commercial restrictions on the marketing of products; and (4) a higher product cost resulting from payments of commissions or fees to the middleman handling sales of products and from bridge financing that may be required owing to long delivery dates. Countertrade arrangements also tend to increase the cost of trade, as additional risks not usually present in normal bank-financed foreign trade must be covered. The use of countertrade has been proposed in some quarters as a means by which countries with high debt service problems can im- prove their trade balances through access to markets where these are otherwise restricted. Such an ap- proach might offer temporary access to markets for these countries. But, it is a second-best solution when viewed from the system as a whole; a far better alternative is for all countries concerned to reduce their level of protectionism. When countertrade is advocated because of the absence of trade financing arising from fears of nonpayment, the best response would seem to be official action to promote the normal trade financing mechanisms and to restore confidence in the management of the economy. Capital Flows During 1984, the long-term trend toward liberaliza- tion by Fund members of regulations governing capital flows continued in the industrial countries, and was extended to the developing countries. As in the recent past, the direction of international capital flows in 1984 was largely influenced by interest rate differentials, expectations regarding exchange rate movements, particularly those of the U.S. dollar, and political and economic uncertainties abroad. The continued financing needs of some of the oil exporting countries and the still heavy borrowing requirements of developing countries with large debt service bur- dens also affected the pattern of international capital flows. In 1984, a number of industrial and developing countries liberalized regulations governing interna- tional operations of commercial banks. Japan abol- ished in April the practice of setting guidelines for lending abroad by Japanese commercial banks; in addition, the limits on net conversion of foreign currency into yen by Japanese banks and branches of foreign banks were abolished in June, at the same time that permission was granted to Japanese and foreign banks to extend Euro-yen lending with maturities of one year or less to Japanese residents for any purpose. In a modification of practices regarding 42 transactions on the Tokyo exchange market, Japanese banks were allowed in July to engage directly with each other in foreign exchange transactions, other than yen-U.S. dollar transactions, without a broker; the exclusion of yen-U.S. dollar transactions from liberalized treatment was abolished in February 1985. In December, foreign and Japanese banks were authorized to issue, from their offices abroad, short- term (six months or less) negotiable Euro-yen certifi- cates of deposit (CDs). However, sales of Euro-yen CDs to Japanese residents are prohibited. At the end of October, New Zealand abolished rules limiting foreign borrowing operations by residents, and soon afterwards financial institutions other than authorized foreign exchange dealers were allowed to borrow abroad to finance their day-to-day operations; finan- cial institutions licensed to deal in foreign exchange continued to be subject to currency exposure limits. Norway eased in June the limits on banks' overall exchange position (spot plus forward) by granting a margin of fluctuation of NKr 200 million to banks quoting binding buying and selling rates for the main currencies against the krone (spot and forward) on a continuing basis. For other banks, lower margins of fluctuation in relation to their respective total assets were specified. The ban on import credits with maturities of up to five years provided by foreign financial institutions was lifted, and legislation was passed allowing a small number of foreign banks to set up subsidiaries in Norway; the activities of foreign-owned banks would be subject to the same general conditions as Norwegian banks. In addition, Norwegian banks were allowed, in October, to grant krone-denominated loans to nonresidents, provided that such applicants had obtained license from the Norges Bank; a quota of NKr 5,000 million for such loans was fixed for 1985 (contingent on the mainte- nance of foreign exchange reserves at a satisfactory level). Among developing countries, the People's Re- public of China established in August special foreign currency lending facilities within the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China for domestic borrowers, and authorized the bank in November to carry out business transactions in foreign exchange in special economic zones. Foreign banks were allowed, since December, to accept deposits and make loans in foreign currency in Shanghai. In January, Korea liberalized the foreign currency management rules of branches of foreign banks by making it easier to swap Japanese yen for won; the new regulation permitted yen received overseas to be sold to the Bank of Korea and later repurchased to provide credit facilities. In a further liberalization of the rules under which foreign ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES bank branches could operate, Korea allowed foreign banks in April to join the National Bankers' Associa- tion, permitted them to apply a higher gearing ratio to their capital in order to expand their lending activities, and announced that, beginning in 1985, branches of foreign banks would be given access to the rediscount facilities of the Bank of Korea on the same terms as domestic banks for export financing. From 1986 onward, the rediscount facility would be fully avail- able to foreign banks on the same basis as that applied to domestic banks. A few countries, mainly within the developing country group, tightened regulations governing capital flows through the banking system. In July, Italy introduced a ceiling on foreign indebtedness of banks; the limit was set at the level outstanding on June 30, 1984. Colombia introduced in April regula- tory procedures concerning foreign borrowing by the domestic banking system and, in May, regulated foreign borrowing by domestic banks to finance purchases of assets by their foreign branches. Leba- non reduced in October the net foreign currency position that commercial banks are authorized to maintain from 50 percent to 15 percent of capital. In October, the United Arab Emirates required banks to maintain interest-free deposits with the Central Bank amounting to 30 percent of their placements with, or lending to, nonresident banks with maturities of one year or less; also, central bank swap facilities were withdrawn for commercial banks having a short position in dirhams, except for the covering of forward transactions for commercial purposes; in November, it was announced that cash reserve re- quirements in the form of deposits held by commer- cial banks with the Central Bank would bear no interest and that the reserve ratios applicable to time deposits were reduced. Zaire reduced, both in April and in May, the net foreign exchange position of banks to 50 percent of their own resources. During the period under review, some countries introduced measures liberalizing the use of nonresi- dent accounts. Finland abolished in January the limit on loans to nonresidents against property in Finland. The limit on the amount of foreign exchange held in Finland by residents and not subject to obliga- tory repatriation was raised from Fmk 5,000 to Fmk 10,000. In addition, the limit on resident foreign exchange holdings not subject to obligatory repatria- tion was raised from Fmk 6,000 to Fmk 10,000. In October, Norway eased the rules for maintaining private working accounts in foreign currency. Among developing countries, Bangladesh in March allowed foreign nationals residing in Bangladesh to obtain up to US$300 (previously US$50) in currency notes for travel abroad against their foreign currency or con- vertible taka accounts. In June Cape Verde allowed the opening by emigrants of interest-bearing foreign exchange deposit accounts, saving-credit deposit ac- counts, and special accounts in Cape Verde escudos; the accounts were to be credited only with convertible foreign currencies, and holders of saving-credit ac- counts could raise loans on special terms for financing small-scale projects. In July, the People's Republic of China allowed individuals to open freely foreign currency accounts with the Bank of China in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjing, and Guangzhou. In September, Greece permitted nonresidents to open time deposits, with maturities of one, three, or six months and interest rates to be negotiated freely, in convertible drachmas; in addition, banks were allowed to make convertible drachma loans to credit institutions abroad for up to six months in amounts not exceeding the bank's total deposits in convertible drachmas. The maximum annual rate of interest payable on blocked deposits was raised in October from 11.5 percent to the rate of interest paid on savings deposits at domestic commercial banks. Grenada liberalized in November the opening of foreign currency and exter- nal accounts. India permitted in April the opening of ordinary nonresident accounts by overseas corporate bodies/trusts with at least 60 percent ownership (or beneficial interest) held by nonresident Indians, provided that the initial deposit was made from remittances abroad or from funds in India eligible for credit to such accounts. In January 1985, Nigeria announced that provisions would be made for the opening of foreign currency accounts in Nigerian banks by residents who acquire foreign exchange other than from export proceeds or from receipts of authorized foreign exchange buyers and dealers, and Somalia introduced import- and export-promoting accounts with the commercial banks and liberalized regulations on the use of external accounts. In February, the Syrian Arab Republic permitted the opening of foreign currency accounts for funds ob- tained outside Syria; funds in such accounts may be used to finance imports, may be transferred abroad without restriction, or may be sold to local banks at the tourist market exchange rate. Also in February, Tunisia extended eligibility for the opening of Expor- tations-Frais Accessoires (EFAC) accounts, in which part of the proceeds of exports can be deposited and used for expenditures abroad, to travel agencies and all providers of services abroad; previously, eligibility had been limited to exporters of goods and hotel services. Three developing countries imposed restrictions on the use of nonresident accounts. In January, Bangla- 43 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS desh limited interest paid on nonresident accounts to 1 percentage point above LIBOR or to rates prevailing in the local money market for taka deposits, whichever is lower. Soon afterwards, imports of capital goods under the Wage Earners' Scheme were permitted against letters of credit, but with deferred payments of up to 360 days. Finally, in December the validity period for Import Entitlement Certificates under the Export Licensing Scheme was reduced from six to three months. Jamaica abolished in January the foreign currency deposit "B" Scheme and required that existing balances under such accounts be cleared by January 31, 1984. In February Sudan prohibited payment of interest on current bank accounts denomi- nated in foreign currency. Several industrial countries introduced measures liberalizing regulations governing portfolio invest- ments. Denmark lifted in January restrictions on purchases by residents of foreign shares in commer- cial or industrial enterprises listed on the stock exchange; restrictions were also lifted on foreign investment by residents in financial and commodity futures. In October, France abolished, with effect retroactive to August, the withholding tax of 25 percent on dividend earnings by nonresident holders of French bonds and in November improved access of European Community institutions to the Paris financial market by allowing increased security issues in francs and issuance of securities denomi- nated in ECUs and exempted from the devise litre regulations. The Federal Republic of Germany dis- continued in August the withholding tax of 25 percent on interest payable to nonresident holders of German fixed-interest securities. In December, Italy reduced the non-interest-bearing deposit requirement in re- spect of investments abroad from a uniform rate of 50 percent to 40 percent for investments in the OECD countries, and to 30 percent for investments in securities of the European Community institutions to be held for at least one year. At the same time, the deposit requirement in respect of investments in foreign securities by mutual funds, within a limit of 10 percent of their total assets, was abolished. As part of a package of measures to further liberalize capital markets, Japan in April eased guidelines on the issue of Euro-yen bonds by residents, allowed residents and nonresidents to swap non-yen bonds into yen (using either the forward exchange market or currency swaps), discontinued the application of the "real demand" principle to forward exchange transactions by residents, further relaxed the notification require- ment on sales of yen-denominated securities to for- eigners, granted permission for sales of foreign certificates of deposits (CDs) and of foreign commer- 44 cial paper (CPs) in the Japanese market, relaxed the rules of eligibility for yen bonds to ,be issued in Tokyo, and increased to ¥ 30 billion the limit on the amount of each yen bond issued by an international agency. In May a bill was passed to eliminate the "designated company" system and to liberalize non- resident acquisition of real estate in Japan; the "designated company" system was abolished in July. In addition, in May Japan passed a bill allowing the issuance of foreign-currency-denominated govern- ment bonds in foreign markets; and the Japanese Government committed itself to further liberalize its financial markets, internationalize the use of the yen, and facilitate the access of foreign institutions to Japanese capital markets. The trading of foreign- currency-denominated bonds in the Gensaki market was permitted, commencing in June. The rules of eligibility, issue amounts, and issuing procedures for the issuance of yen-denominated foreign bonds in Japan were relaxed in Ju ly. Also, in August, Japanese brokers were allowed to deal in international bro- kering, with the exception of transactions involving the yen and the U .S. dollar; this exception was eliminated in February 1985. Foreign private corpora- tions, state and local governments, and government agencies were authorized in December to issue Euro- yen bonds; previously, such authorization had been confined to national governments and international organizations. Late in the year, New Zealand re- moved all restrictions on the access of foreign-owned companies operating in the country to the domestic capital market, and relaxed restrictions on foreign ownership by foreign exchange dealers; in addition, residents were permitted to purchase foreign exchange for investment purposes. Norway introduced in June measures permitting residents to purchase quoted and nonquoted foreign shares; however, purchases of nonquoted shares were made subject to licenses. Permission was also granted for purchases of Euro- krone bonds by residents in the secondary market. Subject to the limit of the Concession Acts and the respective companies' Articles of Association, Nor- way allowed nonresidents, in June, to purchase nonquoted, as well as quoted, shares. Sweden relaxed in February the minimum required maturity for foreign currency borrowing abroad by enterprises and local governments from five years to two years, and abolished in May the requirement that the amount of such borrowing be at least SKr 10 million. In January, Switzerland eliminated the queuing system (under which a limit of three issues per week was imposed on foreign bond issues) and raised the maximum amount per issue from Sw F 100 million to Sw F 200 million. The United States repealed, in Ju ly, the 30 percent ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES withholding tax on interest paid to foreign investors in U.S. securities, removing a barrier that had prevented U.S. borrowers, including the U.S. Treasury, from issuing bearer bonds to foreign investors. In August, the U.S. Treasury announced that it would not issue bearer bonds but would instead issue special regis- tered securities to foreigners that provide some degree of anonymity to the purchaser. Among developing countries, the People's Republic of China allowed local companies to sell to individual foreigners stock in newly established corporations located in a special economic zone. Very few countries introduced measures that re- stricted portfolio investments abroad. In June, Aus- tralia applied new taxation screening arrangements to certain outward capital transfers. Norway revoked in November the permission for foreigners to purchase Norwegian bonds up to certain limits. Foreign insur- ance companies can, however, be given special permission to invest in such bonds to cover their need for technical reserves. In a modification of the deposit requirement for medium-term notes, Switzerland made the Swiss Security Clearing Organization (SEGA) eligible in January to act as a custodian in addition to existing custodians, consisting of the issuing bank members of the syndicate. Among developing countries, Colombia established in March that external borrowing by residents to finance invest- ments abroad would be subject to approval by the Ministry of Planning and could not have a maturity of less than four years, with two years minimum grace. Israel tightened in January controls on portfolio investments abroad as residents were no longer permitted to hold bank accounts abroad (except exporters in connection with export proceeds) or to buy foreign securities (except certain securities of Israeli firms issued abroad); existing bank accounts abroad were required to be closed by April 1, 1985, but foreign securities bought before January 17, 1984 could continue to be held. In addition, Israeli resi- dents would no longer be permitted to buy gold bullion or coin for investment purposes, and Israeli emigrants would be allowed to transfer their assets abroad only by means of annual remittances not exceeding US$2,000 per person. In March, Zim- babwe decided to acquire the foreign-currency- denominated securities being held on behalf of resi- dents and nonresidents by nominee companies, in exchange for local currency holdings. In addition, income remittances from blocked funds of companies and individuals were suspended; however, holders of blocked funds could invest their funds in Government of Zimbabwe external bonds. Zimbabwe also required those applying for emigrant status to liquidate their assets within a period of six months and to invest the total proceeds, less any settling-in allowance, in Government of Zimbabwe external bonds. Several industrial and developing countries liberalized regulations governing foreign direct in- vestments. Finland raised in January the limit on the purchase of foreign exchange for the purchase of a second home abroad, from Fmk 250,000 to Fmk 300,000. In January, France exempted foreign direct investment by small and medium-sized firms from foreign financing obligations, and raised the limit for exemption from the foreign financing obliga- tions from F 1 million to F 2 million. The proportion of foreign direct investment that is required to be financed abroad was reduced in November from 75 percent to 50 percent for direct investment in EC countries. In addition, the period for obligatory review of applications for direct investment in France was reduced to one month in all cases. Previously, it was two months for applicants from other EC member states, and there was an unspecified time limit in the case of other applicants. Norway abolished in June the limit of NKr 400,000 on the purchase of real estate for recreational purposes, and lifted the ban on borrowing abroad in connection with such a purchase. At the same time, the licensing system for inward direct investment with respect to transfer of share capital was replaced by a reporting system, thus subjecting such investments to the Concession Acts and other relevant regulations. In March, the United States signed a tax treaty on the avoidance of double taxation with the People's Republic of China. Among devel- oping countries, Cameroon introduced a new invest- ment code which provided for a range of fiscal incentives for foreign direct investment. During the period under review, the People's Republic of China adopted a range of measures in a move to attract direct investment from abroad. In January, the municipality of Shanghai was granted authority to approve directly direct foreign investment for up to a value of US$10 million. In April, it was announced that 14 selected coastal cities would be opened further to outside direct foreign investment and, in May, the harbor city of Beihai was officially opened to foreign direct investment by medium-sized and small elec- tronics and light industrial enterprises, which will be eligible for preferential tax treatment. It was also announced that income of foreign investors operating on their own, or in joint partnership with Chinese entities in Hainan Island, will be exempt from income tax during the first two years, but subject to a 15 percent tax in the third year. Consolidated indus- trial and commercial taxes will be reduced or elimi- nated during the first three years for undertakings 45 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS subject to production difficulties, while imports of certain inputs will be exempted from customs duties. In June, the municipality of Shanghai announced preferential local tax treatment for foreign investors in the economic and technological zone in Shanghai. In Ju ly, to speed up a "wider opening up" of the 14 designated coastal cities, the State Council announced that these cities will be allowed to offer additional tax incentives to foreign investors providing advanced technologies. In addition, special economic and tech- nological development areas will be set up in these cities, where the 10 percent tax levied on the amount of profits remitted abroad by the foreign investors would be waived and, as in the special economic zones, the profits of joint ventures established in the designated areas will be subject to a 15 percent income tax, instead of the standard 33 percent. Moreover, imports of means of production by or for joint ventures in the 14 coastal cities will be exempt from customs duties as well as from consolidated industrial and commercial taxes. Products for export will also be exempt from export customs duties, and a certain proportion of products requiring advanced manufacturing techniques will be permitted to be marketed domestically. In November, the State Coun- cil issued new regulations on income taxes and on the consolidated industrial and commercial taxes in the special economic zones and in the new economic and technological development zones in 14 coastal cities. Under these regulations, income taxes on long-term industrial communication, transport, agricultural and service trade undertakings, other than those in the special economic zones and the new economic and technological development zones, will be waived in their first one or two profit-making years, and will be reduced by 50 percent in the following two or three years. However, profits generated in the 14 coastal cities will be subject to taxation up to 80 percent of the standard tax rate of 33 percent. Consolidated indus- trial and commercial tax exemptions will be granted on imports of inputs, on export products, and on those sold within the special zones or designated areas in the 14 coastal cities; however, products sold in the People's Republic of China outside these zones and areas will continue to be subject to customs duties. In addition, foreign participants in joint ventures in the zones and areas mentioned above will be allowed to remit abroad their profits tax free, while a 10 percent tax will be levied on income from royalties, divi- dends, interest and rentals, against a rate of 20 percent elsewhere in the People's Republic of China. The exemptions and reductions of income tax are with effect in 1984. Finally, in January 1985, the People's Republic of China, following experiments in the 46 special economic zones and the 14 coastal cities, took a further step in its current policy of opening up to the outside world by unveiling new plans to open four large industrialized regions to foreign investment and trade. Ecuador permitted from January foreign invest- ment in insurance, re-insurance, commercial banking, and financial companies. Also in January, Indonesia adopted a new income tax law which provides new incentives for direct foreign investment. Ivory Coast modified in November the investment code under which it granted new incentives to direct foreign investment in certain priority sectors and geographical areas, including exemptions from customs duties and tariffs on all imported capital equipment and spare parts, and temporary exemptions from corporate profit taxes, patent contributions, and capital asset taxes. The exemptions would apply to 100 percent of applicable taxes up to the third to last year of the exemption period, 75 percent of the applicable taxes in the second to last year of the exemption period, and 25 percent in the last year of the exemption period. In July, Korea adopted a revised Foreign Capital Induce- ment Act which expanded the areas for foreign investment by introducing a "negative list system," under which only those industries closed to foreign investment were specified. Automatic approval would henceforth be granted, in principle, for equity partici- pation amounting to less than 50 percent of the total, or US$1 million, for a single project; equity partici- pation up to 100 percent would also be permitted under the new law. In addition, Korea announced in December detailed rules guiding approval of foreign investment in sectors reserved for restricted projects which, among others, specified criteria to be met by foreign investors in certain manufacturing industries and foreign trade projects. Malaysia relaxed in August restrictions on foreign direct investment by allowing large foreign firms engaged in capital- and technol- ogy-intensive production to hold majority equity shares. In addition, the possibility of 100 percent foreign ownership, previously limited to export indus- tries, was extended to other sectors. In February, Mexico announced a list of priority sectors where majority foreign ownership would be allowed; as a rule, foreign ownership had been limited to 49 percent of capital. The list included electrical and nonelectri- cal machinery, metal products, electronics, transpor- tation materials, chemicals, biotechnology, hotels, and certain other industrial sectors. Priority would also be given to investments directed to the export market. Effective September, Mozambique provided, under a new investment code, various incentives to foreign direct investment, which included, among others, guarantees for profit remittances, protection ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN REGIONAL ARRANGEMENTS against nationalization, and provisions for income tax and import duty concessions for foreign investors. In November, Yugoslavia adopted a new law on joint ventures that eliminated the previous restrictions on the shares of capital and profits of a foreign partner in joint ventures, and provided for a larger role by the foreign partner in the management of the joint venture. Zaire authorized in July the repatriation of foreign capital and transfer of profits and dividends on such capital under the provisions of the Investment Code. The regulations governing direct foreign invest- ment were tightened in three developing countries. Bangladesh required the sterling tea companies in February to place on deposit in Bangladesh 10 percent of their annual remittable profits, until the total amount of such deposits reached 200 percent of their paid-up capital. In June, Colombia announced that profits beyond the 20 percent limit on outward remittances would be counted as additional foreign investment capital if invested in new enterprises, provided that at least 80 percent of their production is exported and that at least 40 percent of their financing is in the form of direct investment and/or medium- and long-term external borrowing. Finally, in January Nigeria announced that dividends due to nonresident investors could be reinvested in new companies, provided that an additional amount equal to one half of the remittable amount was imported; the additional capital inflow is required to enable the investor to qualify for approved status. In January 1985 Egypt canceled the authorization to use foreign exchange in Free Accounts to effect import payments. However, authorization was granted until March 21 ,1985 for owners of outstand- ing balances in Free Accounts and Import Accounts to use Egyptian pounds resulting from the sale of such balances for imports related to the activities of the account holders. These measures were rescinded in April. Norway introduced in January 1985 measures permitting residents to purchase quoted foreign bonds within certain limits (NKr 1 million for individuals and NKr 5 million for companies). Gold As in recent years, few Fund members introduced new regulations concerning procedures for the export and import of gold as well as for dealings in domestic holdings of gold. The premiums on Krugerrands sold by Intergold to local distributors in South Africa were reduced. In Mexico exporters of jewelry and precious metals were directed to surrender their export receipts exclusively through Banca Cremi (a nationalized commercial bank). Imports and exports of nonmone- tary gold (other than jewelry for personal use) and of gold coins eligible as legal tender in Venezuela or abroad were made subject to prior authorization by the Central Bank. Effective April 25, India introduced a gold jewelry export promotion replenishment scheme whereby exporters of ornaments and articles made of gold of not less than 0.5833 fineness (equivalent to 14 carats) were entitled to the replenishment by gold imported by the State Bank of India, and supplied at prices notified by the Government against release orders issued by licensing authorities, provided that they satisfy "value added" and other requirements of the scheme. In February, the monopoly of the Bank of Sierra Leone over gold exports was terminated, and licenses were to be granted to private exporters. In Zaire residents other than the monetary authorities and producers of gold were prohibited from purchasing, holding, or selling gold in any form. With the exception of jewelry, imports and exports of gold require prior authorization from the Bank of Zaire. Gold produced by mining companies is purchased by the Bank of Zaire under certain terms, and the bank may authorize part of the gold produced by these companies to be sold to residents for their industrial activities. There is a free trade in domestic gold mined by small-scale producers. IV. Main Developments in Regional Arrangements Several measures to foster regional cooperation were taken in 1984. The European Community (EC)10 entered into a new cooperation agreement with the People's Republic of China, continued negotiations 10Belgium, Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Nether- lands, and the United Kingdom. on the accession of Portugal and Spain to the EC, and signed a third Lome Convention with the African, Caribbean, and Pacific States (ACP). The Central African states agreed on a constitution for a new economic grouping, and four regional arrangements in Africa were expanded. In Asia, a new member was admitted to the Association of South East Asian Nations, and the liberalization of interregional trade 47 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPORT ON EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS flows continued. The six states of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf11 strengthened their trade links and liberalized real estate legislation. The Caribbean states agreed to revive a multilateral trade clearing facility. Negotiations continued on the accession of Portugal and Spain to the EC. After some 45 negotiating sessions with each candidate country, substantive agreement was achieved in transport, steel, and capital movements, and on related economic and financial matters. During 1984 progress was made in the following areas: wine production, the Integrated Mediterranean Program, fisheries, and imports of fruit and vegetables. In the sixteenth through twenty- third ministerial meetings held in the course of 1984 to negotiate Portugal's accession, agreements were reached on taxes, direct investment, and agriculture. The twentieth ministerial meeting between Spain and the EC, held on April 10, concluded agreements on the adoption of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and on the preferential arrangements with the Mediterranean countries, the African, Caribbean and Pacific States, and the Overseas Countries and Ter- ritories (OCT). The People's Republic of China and the EC signed a new five-year textile agreement on March 16, and a new trade and economic cooperation agreement on September 26, 1984, superseding a previous trade agreement signed in 1978. The second Financial Protocols between the EC and Israel and Cyprus entered into force in January and May, respectively. The protocols provide for Community assistance of ECU 40 million through October 31, 1986 in the case of Israel, and ECU 44 million through December 31, 1988 in the case of Cyprus. In December, the EC and Israel signed a third Financial Protocol outlining a new schedule for reducing customs duties. The third ministerial meeting of the EC-Egypt Cooperation Council, held on April 9, reviewed relations between the Community and Egypt as covered by the provi- sions of the 1977 Cooperation Agreement and dis- cussed efforts to reduce Egypt's trade deficit with the Community. In June 1984, the EC adopted a Decision on a second Financial Protocol with Yugoslavia and extended the existing trade provisions of the EC- Yugoslavia Cooperation Agreement until June 30, 1985. Also in June, the EC extended the existing trade arrangements with Cyprus and Malta until the end of December 1984.

On December 8, a new EC-ACP convention (Lome III) was signed by representatives of the Community and the 65 countries of the African, Caribbean, and Pacific States.12 The new convention is to run for five years starting March 1, 1985 and replaces Lome II which expired on February 28, 1985. Participants agreed to a financial endowment of ECU 8.5 billion, and to promote measures designed to encourage European industrial investment in Africa. It was also agreed that under the stabilization of ACP export earnings system (STABEX), ACP countries must furnish both specific details on how the transferred money is to be used and a subsequent report detailing how the money was allocated. On June 4, the EC concluded the cooperation agreement between the Community and the Andean Group13 signed inXartagena, Colombia, in December 1983. Under this five-year nonpreferential agreement, commercial and economic links between enterprises in the two regions will be strengthened and the two parties will grant each other most-favored-nation status under the GATT. Ministers of the European Community met with the Foreign Ministers of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)14 on July 12-13 in Jakarta, and again in Dublin on November 15-16.

In addition, following Brunei's accession to ASEAN on January 7, 1985, the member states' request that the EC-ASEAN Cooperation Agreement signed in 1980 be extended to their sixth member was granted during the November meeting. At the conclusion of the first EC-EFTA15 ministe- rial meeting on April 9, in Luxembourg, a Joint Declaration was issued praising the abolition in early 1984 of the last remaining intra-EC-EFTA tariff barriers and quantitative restrictions on industrial products. The Declaration also emphasized the need to oppose protectionist pressures; simplify origin rules and customs documentation; facilitate border controls; increase cooperation in the fields of research and development, transport, agriculture, fisheries, en- ergy, tourism; and the importance of intensifying efforts to sustain and consolidate the economic recov- ery. These main points were reiterated by the heads of EFT A Governments during a meeting held in Visby, Sweden, on May 23 and again in Geneva at the ministerial meeting of the EFTA Council held on November 5-6, 1984. On July 12, the EFTA Council decided to establish a Committee on Technical Bar- riers to Trade.

Not for Redistribution PART TWO ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part Two Part Two gives a detailed description of the exchange and trade system of ind iv idual member countries, inc lud- ing a nonmetropolitan territory (Hong Kong), for wh ich the United Kingdom has accepted the Fund's Articles of Agreement, and the Netherlands An t i l les, wh ich is a part of the Kingdom of the Ne ther lands. The exchange and trade system of one other country, wh ich is not a member of the Fund, is also described. In general, the description relates to the exchange and trade systems as at the end of 1984, but in appropriate cases reference is made to s ign i f icant developments that took place early in 1985. A standardized approach has been fo l lowed, under which the description of each system is broken down into similar headings, and the coverage for each country includes a f inal section that lists chronologically the more s ign i f icant changes during 1984. The . description of the restrictive system is not necessarily confined to those aspects invo lv ing exchange restrictions or exchange controls. As in previous Re- ports, questions of definition and jur isd ic t ion have not been raised, and an attempt has been made to describe restrictive systems in their entirety, except for the tar iff structure and, in most cases, direct taxes on exports and imports. Thus, the coverage extends to such features as import licensing, advance deposit requirements, import surcharges, travel taxes, export licensing, and export incentive schemes. S im i la r ly, the section "Changes During 1984" includes references to certain devel- opments that may have a direct impact on international transactions but are not reflected in the body of the country descriptions, such as major revisions of import tariffs or developments in regional cooperation. The description given in the section Exchange Ar- rangement is in l ine w i th the notification of exchange arrangements that member countries have fu rn ished to the Fund under A r t i c le IV, Section 2(a}. The s t ru c tu re of exchange markets is described, and the off ic ial exchange rate is g iven. The rates quoted are those effective on December 31, 1984, unless stated otherwise. Under Administration of Control, some indication is given of the authorities responsible for policy and administration of the controls and of the extent to wh ich their powers are delegated for working purposes. The section on Prescription of Currency describes the requirements affec t ing the selection of the currency and method of settlement for transactions w i th other coun- tries. Where a country has concluded payments agree- ments w i th other countries, the terms of these agree- ments often lead to prescription of the currency for specified categories of payments to and from the coun- tries concerned. The countries w i th wh ich bilateral payments agreements are in force are listed either in the text or in a footnote. Under Nonresident Accounts, a description is given of the manner in which the country treats accounts, if any, maintained in its currency by account holders who are not regarded as resident in that country, and the fac i l i t ies and limitations attached to such accounts. Where there is more than one type of nonresident account, the nature and operation of the various types are also described. In the section on Imports and Import Payments, import licensing requirements are described br ief ly, and details are given of other requirements imposed on payments for imports and of any advance deposit requirements. The term "open general license" indicates arrangements whereby certain imports or other international transac- tions are exempt from the restrictive application of licensing requirements, in contrast to an " ind iv idual license," which may be given either free ly, or restric- tively, according to adm in is tra t ive decisions. Under Payments for Invisibles, the procedures for permitting payments abroad for current transactions in invisibles are described br ief ly, together w i th any l im i ta- tions on the export of foreign and domestic bank notes. For some countries that do not impose l im i ta t ions on payments for invisibles, this section is combined w i th the section on Proceeds from Invisibles (see below). Export licensing requirements and procedures are described under Exports and Export Proceeds, w i th an outline of the requirements that may be imposed on the handling of proceeds from exports. The expression "exchange receipts must be surrendered" indicates that the recipient is required by the regulations to sell any foreign exchange proceeds in return for local currency, usually at the official rate, to the central bank or to a commercial bank or exchange dealer authorized for this purpose. In some countries there is a requirement that such exchange or part thereof be sold in a free market. Under Proceeds from Invisibles, any regulations gov- erning exchange derived from transactions in invisibles are given, and any limitations on the import of foreign and domestic bank notes are described. The coverage under Capital describes the special arrangements or limitations attached to international capital movements. Where regulations on foreign capital also cover the income thereon, they are usua l ly dealt with in this section rather than in the sections on Payments for Invisibles and Proceeds from Invisibles. The section on Gold gives a summary of the principal regulations that govern the holding, negotiation, import, and export of gold coin and gold in other forms. In this Report, references to "Taiwan" are to the Taiwan Province of China. 54 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution AFGHANISTAN (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Afghanistan is the Afghani. Da Afghanistan Bank (the central bank) maintains an offi- cial rate applied to (a) foreign exchange proceeds from exports of natural gas, karakul, cotton, and wool; (b) transactions for government and authorized transac- tions for public enterprises; (c) certain foreign currency income earned in Afghanistan (see Proceeds from Invis- ibles, below); and (d) all transactions in accounting units specified under bilateral payments agreements. Transac- tions by Da Afghanistan Bank and the commercial banks in convertible exchange not subject to the official rate are undertaken at a separate operational rate more depre- ciated than the official rate. Both rates are defined in terms of the U.S. dollar and are flexible. On Dec- ember 31, 1984, the official exchange rate was Af 50.0 = US$1 buying and Af 51.20 = US$1 selling; the exchange rate in the second (operational) market on the same date was Af 55.00 = US$1 and Af 56.25 = US$1 for buying and selling, respectively. Da Afghanistan Bank posts rates for deutsche mark, French francs, Indian rupees, Pakistan rupees, pounds sterling, and Swiss francs. Da Afghanistan Bank charges commis- sions ranging from 0.10 percent to 0.375 percent on exchange transactions. Proceeds of raisin exports to the U.S.S.R. (other than those by agricultural cooperatives) that are sold to Da Afghanistan Bank are subject to an exchange surcharge of 7 percent; the surcharge is refunded if the exporter should within one year buy back the foreign exchange to pay for imports from the U.S.S.R. Transactions which are not required to be effected with the banks may take place in the bazaar foreign exchange market, where the rates are more depreciated than those maintained by the banks. Administration of Control Foreign exchange transactions are controlled by the Government through Da Afghanistan Bank. The control is facilitated by the existence of relatively large compa- nies specializing in the export of such commodities as karakul, cotton, wool, and carpets. However, these companies do not exercise a monopoly over the export of such commodities, with the exception that the export of cotton is reserved for four authorized companies. Prescription of Currency Settlements with countries with which Afghanistan has bilateral payments agreements1 must be made in bilateral accounting dollars in accordance with the procedures set forth in those agreements. The proceeds from exports of wool and cotton to other countries and of 'The People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, and the U .S .S .R. karakul to all countries must be obtained in convertible currencies. There are no other prescription of currency requirements. Imports and Import Payments Imports are not subject to license, but import transac- tions must be registered before orders are placed abroad. Imports of a few items (e.g., some drugs, liquor, arms, and ammunition) are prohibited on grounds of public policy or for security reasons; in some instances, however, special permission to import these goods may be granted. The importation of certain other goods (e.g., a few textiles and selected nonessential consumer goods) also is prohibited. There are no quantitative restrictions on other imports. Most bilateral agreements, however, specify quantities (and sometimes prices) for com- modities to be traded. Most of the trade with bilateral agreement countries is carried out on a compensation basis, and usually both imports and exports are arranged by the same trader; imports made against export pro- ceeds subject to surrender requirements (i.e., from natural gas, cotton, and wool) are carried out by the Government or government agencies, or the proceeds of such exports are allocated for servicing of the Govern- ment's external debt. The present customs tariff structure was promulgated in June 1974 and has since then been modified in the annual budgets. Actual tariff rates, ad valorem and specific, vary considerably. Ad valorem duties usually range between 20 percent and 35 percent. Payments for imports through the banking system to payments agreement countries may usually be made only under letters of credit. Payments to other countries may be made under letters of credit, against bills for collec- tion, or against an undertaking by the importer to import goods at least equivalent to the payment made through the banking system. Generally, a deposit of up to 40 per- cent of the c.i.f. value is required by banks from private enterprises upon opening of a letter of credit. Foreign exchange for payments for imports by the private sector has to be acquired in the bazaar market. Payments for Invisibles Tourists are permitted to take out up to US$2,000 or the equivalent in other foreign currencies, and traders can take out up to US$15,000 for imports of goods. When foreign travel is for other purposes, the permissi- ble amounts are determined by the appropriate authori- ties in each case. Permission from the central bank or one of the commercial banks is necessary for taking out foreign currency. Exchange for private travel, as for other private purposes, has to be acquired in the bazaar market. The fee for a passport valid for one year is Af 20,000 for tourist travel and Af 1,000 to Af 2,500 for other types of travel. Export of foreign currency notes up 55 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution AFGHANISTAN to US$2,000 or its equivalent by travelers is permitted only if the foreign exchange has been bought from the banking system. Travelers are not allowed to take out more than Af 1,000 in domestic bank notes and Af 50 in coins. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports (other than gold) are not subject to license, but export transactions must be registered. Exports of a few commodities (e.g., opium and museum pieces) are prohibited. Otherwise, control is exercised only over exports to bilateral agreement countries (see section on Imports and Import Payments, above). Proceeds from exports of karakul to all countries, including payments agreement countries, are received in convertible curren- cies. Receipts from exports of natural gas, karakul, cotton, wool, citrus fruits, and urea are subject to surrender requirements at the official rate. Other export receipts in convertible currency are exchanged at the operational rate, but exporters may use such funds for importing goods themselves or transfer the foreign exchange to other importers to pay for imports of 33 specified commodities, including tea, matches, soap, textiles, edible oils, and motor oil. Da Afghanistan Bank buys foreign exchange from exports to bilateral pay- ments agreement countries, but there is no obligation to surrender foreign exchange to the banks. Thirty percent of proceeds from exports of raisins to the U .S .S .R. under contracts signed in 1984 are receivable in convert- ible currency. Proceeds from Invisibles Sixty percent of the foreign currency salaries of foreign employees working in the Afghan public and private sectors must be converted into Afghanis at the official rate. Travelers entering Afghanistan are required to spend a minimum of the equivalent of US$26 per day in foreign exchange. They may bring in any amount of foreign currency but must declare it when entering the country if they intend to take out any residue when leaving the country, subject to the above minimum conversion requirement. Travelers may bring in no more than Af 2,000 in Afghan banknotes and Af 50 in Afghan coins. Capital Foreign investment in Afghanistan requires prior approval and is administered by an Investment Commit- tee. The Foreign and Domestic Private Investment Law of 1353 (issued on July 4, 1974) provides for a number of benefits, which include (1) income tax exemption for four years (six years outside Kabul province), beginning from the date of the first sales of products resulting from the new investment; (2) exemption from import duties on essential imports (mainly of capital goods); (3) exemp- tion from taxes on dividends for four years after the first 56 distribution of dividends, but not more than seven years after the approval of the investment; (4) exemption from personal income and corporate taxes on interest on foreign loans which constitute part of an approved investment; (5) exemption from export duties, provided that the products are permitted to be exported; and (6) mandatory purchases by government agencies and departments of their requirements from enterprises estab- lished under the law where prices of such products are not more than 15 percent higher than prices of foreign supplies. The law provides that foreign investment in Afghanistan can only take place through joint ventures, with foreign participation not exceeding 49 percent. It also establishes that an investment approved by the Investment Committee shall require no further license in order to operate in Afghanistan. Payments of principal and interest on loans from abroad may be remitted freely to the extent of the legal obligation involved. Profits may be repatriated freely, and capital may be repatriated after five years at an annual rate not exceeding 20 percent of the total registered capital. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell domes- tically gold in any form. Imports of gold are restricted. Exports of gold bullion and silver, as well as of jewelry, require permission of Da Afghanistan Bank and the Ministry of Finance. Commercial exports of gold and silver jewelry and of other articles containing minor quantities of gold or silver do not require a license and may be made freely. Customs duties are payable on imports and exports of silver in any form unless the import or export is made by or on behalf of the monetary authorities. Changes During 1984 Prescription of Currency March 31. The bilateral payments agreement between Afghanistan and Hungary expired. Exports and Export Proceeds March 15. A regulation was introduced making 30 percent of proceeds of exports of raisins to the U .S .S .R. during 1984 receivable in convertible currencies. July 16. The requirement that 50 percent of proceeds of raisin exports by individuals and 70 percent of such exports by commercial institutions be surrendered to Da Afghanistan Bank was abolished, together with the tax of Af 50 a ton on exports of raisins to the People's Republic of China and Czechoslovakia. August 15. The number of items which could be imported with foreign exchange retained by exporters (or transferred by them to other importers) was increased from 5 to 33. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ALGERIA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Algeria is the Algerian Dinar. Daily buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar, the interven- tion currency, and other specified currencies1 are estab- lished by the Central Bank of Algeria on the basis of a fixed relationship between the dinar and a composite of currencies. The currencies included in the composite and their weights take into account the relative importance of payments, including capital transactions, that are made in these currencies. A margin of DA 0.015 has been established between the buying and selling rates of the dinar in terms of the U.S. dollar. An encouragement premium is granted on the conversion of convertible currencies repatriated by Algerians working abroad. Up to February 1983, the premium was adjusted so as to ensure that the exchange rate for such remittances was DA 1 = F 1; thereafter, the amount of the premium has been determined periodically by a decree of the Ministry of Finance. On each trip to Algeria, Algerians gainfully employed abroad are required to exchange an amount of convertible currency equivalent to DA 700 at the exchange rate operative on the day the transaction takes place. They receive the incentive premium only on those conversions or transfers that are not required of them by law or regulation. The foreign exchange reserves are centralized in the Central Bank; authorized banks must clear their foreign currency position with their foreign correspondents at the end of each day but, under certain conditions, they are permitted to hold cover for documentary credits outside Algeria. There are no forward exchange facilities. Administration of Control The Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank have general jurisdiction over exchange control. The Central Bank assists in the formulation of the exchange legisla- tion and regulations and is responsible for their applica- tion by the authorized banks. Authority over many exchange control procedures has been delegated to four commercial banks and the Postal Administration. Import and export licenses and global import quotas are issued by the Ministry of Commerce within the limits of a general import program. Import and export licenses require the visa of the Central Bank. The Societe Nationale pour la Recherche, la Production, le Trans- port, la Transformation et la Commercialisation des Hydrocarbures (SONATRACH) has a monopoly over im- ports and domestic sales of petroleum and petroleum products and handles most exports of these commodities. Investment of foreign capital in excess of DA 500,000 in Algeria requires approval by a National Investment Committee in order to obtain the benefits of the Investment Code. Prescription of Currency Settlements with countries with which no payments agreements are in force are made in convertible curren- cies.2 Payments under foreign supply contracts (contrats de fournitures) can be made in either the currency in use at the headquarters of the supplier or that of the country of origin of the merchandise. Foreign holders of servic- ing contracts are required to open local nonresident accounts to which payments are made by the Algerian contracting party; such accounts must be closed within six months from the end of the contract, beyond which date outward transfers of the funds or their use for purposes unrelated to the contracts is not permitted. Nonresident Accounts Most nonresident accounts are Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dinars or Internal Nonresident Accounts. There are at present four types of accounts, as follows: 1. Individual Suspense Accounts may be opened without authorization and may be credited with pay- ments from any country. Balances in such accounts opened prior to January 1, 1975 by nonresident physical persons of foreign nationality have been released for transfer abroad. 2. Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dinars (CEDAC accounts) may be opened by individuals or juridical persons of foreign nationality, including those under supply or servicing contract arrangements. Such ac- counts may be credited only with deposits that, under the regulations applicable when the deposit is made, are free from any restrictions on transfer. They may not be credited with amounts that are transferable to the bilateral area. They may be debited for payments to any foreign country, for payments in Algeria, or for the provision of foreign bank notes that the account holder intends to export when he travels abroad. These accounts bear interest and may not show a net debt position. 3. Final Departure Accounts may be opened, without prior authorization, in the name of any physical person residing in Algeria, not of Algerian nationality, who intends to leave Algeria to return to the country of origin. These accounts may be credited freely with an amount equivalent to the holdings on October 20, 1963 in the account of the person concerned; with the proceeds from sales of real estate of the account holder, provided that the funds are paid directly by a notary public; with the proceeds of the sale of securities through a bank; and Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Netherlands guil- ders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. 2 Specified noncommercial settlements with Morocco and Tunisia are channeled through a dirham account at the Bank of Morocco and an account in Tunisian dinars at the Central Bank of Tunisia. 57 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ALGERIA with any other payments, up to DA 2,000. These accounts may be debited without prior approval for certain payments in Algeria on behalf of the account holder. Outward transfers require individual approval. Emigrant workers may maintain certain accounts in Algeria that are credited with the proceeds from the conversion of convertible currencies (comptes epargne- devises). Depositors receive an incentive premium equivalent to 40 percent of the buying exchange rate on the conversion date of such foreign exchange. 4. Foreign Currency Accounts are held by physical or juridical foreign nationals, who may be either nonresi- dents or persons who have resided for more than six months in a foreign country; they may also be held by Algerians residing abroad. Such accounts may be freely credited with (a) book transfers from abroad using either postal or banking facilities, (b) imported convertible foreign currencies which have been declared at the account holder's entry in the country, and (c) domestic bank-to-bank book transfers. The accounts may be freely debited for book transfers abroad but only through the banking system; they may also be debited for purchases of dinars, for book transfers in dinars, and for purchases of convertible foreign currencies to be physically ex- ported by the account holder. A conversion premium is received on any amount drawn and used for payment of expenses in the country, with the exception of legal payment obligations. The interest rate payable on de- posits in these accounts is fixed annually by the Minister of Finance. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Certain imports are prohibited regardless of origin. Law No. 78-02 of February 11, 1978 gives the Government a monopoly over foreign trade. All imports are permitted, in principle, in accordance with an annual import program. This is implemented mainly through global import authorizations (autorisations globales d'importa- tion, or AGI) granted to public enterprises. There are five types of import authorizations: (1) AGI Monopole, issued to enterprises holding monopoly rights to import specified commodities; (2) AGI de fonctionnement in- terne, issued to individual enterprises for import require- ments relating to their production activity; and (3) AGI objectif planifie', issued to enterprises for imports relat- ing to their investment program; (4) AGI (sans paie- menf), under which exemption from all exchange control formalities are granted to transactions not involving use of official foreign exchange or local currency or any other counterparts; (5) AGI (sans transfer), issued to enterprises for specified import products (classified as consumable products—matieres consommables) utilized in public works contracts; simplified exchange and trade control formalities applied to such transactions. All imports must be domiciled with an authorized bank, to which the necessary import documents must be presented and through which all payments related to the transaction must be made. Without a waiver from the 58 exchange control authority (the Ministry of Finance or the Central Bank), advance payments may not exceed 15 percent of the import value. In accordance with Law No. 80-07 of August 3, 1980, imports must be insured domestically. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles to all countries require the approval of the Central Bank. When supporting docu- ments are presented, however, approval may be granted by authorized banks, or sometimes by the Postal Admin- istration, either freely or up to specified limits for certain payments such as (1) those relating to approved trade transactions and maritime contracts, (2) travel expenses, (3) transfers of salaries and wages, (4) educational expenses, and (5) advertising expenses. For payments for which the approval authority has not been delegated, the granting of exchange must be authorized by either the Central Bank or the Ministry of Finance. Certain public enterprises, which receive special exchange allocations (budget devises), may use these freely for payments for specified invisibles, including transportation and other services contracted abroad. The transfer of family remittances is suspended. Insurance on all risks arranged in Algeria by Algerian residents must be purchased in Algeria. Residents of other countries working in Algeria under the programs for technical cooperation or for public enterprises and agencies or for certain mixed companies may transfer abroad a percentage of their net salaries, as follows: 50 percent for single persons and married persons having their families in Algeria; and 70 percent for persons having their families abroad. For other workers who have contracts with other employers and hold the necessary employment documents, the amounts that may be transferred are 35 percent for single persons and married persons having their families in Algeria and 55 percent for persons having their families abroad. The payments must be transferred once a month on the basis of the remuneration for the previous month. Persons making such transfers are not entitled to allocations for other personal transfers. For resident nationals and individuals of foreign nationality in resident status (excluding those having an entitlement to make transfers) traveling by air or sea to foreign countries, including countries in the French Franc Area, other than for medical reasons, the foreign exchange allocation is equivalent to DA 1,000 a person a calendar year (DA 500 for children under 15 years) and is delivered on presentation of a valid passport and travel vouchers; for overland travel, the allocation is DA 1,000 a person a calendar year for adults and DA 500 for children under 15 years. Residents requiring medical treatment abroad receive a foreign exchange allowance equal to DA 800 if the patient is over 15 years and DA 400 if the patient is under 15 years. On each trip to Algeria, Algerians gainfully employed abroad are re- quired to exchange an amount of convertible currency equivalent to DA 700 at the exchange rate operative on ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution the day the transaction takes place. They receive the incentive premium only on those conversions or transfers that are not required of them by law or regulation. Emigrant Algerian workers who take their vacations in Algeria may, when returning abroad, re-export foreign exchange freely imported and duly declared on their arrival in Algeria. Pilgrims traveling to Saudi Arabia receive an alloca- tion in Saudi Arabian riyals; the amount of this allow- ance is fixed for each pilgrimage and may be furnished in the form of checks that may be cashed on arrival for those traveling by sea or by air. Resident travelers may take out Algerian dinar bank notes up to DA 50 a person. Foreign nonresident travelers may also re-export any foreign currency declared upon entry. However, on their arrival in Algeria, foreign nonresidents must convert foreign exchange equivalent to a minimum of DA 1,000. Travel tickets that are bought by nonresidents for traveling abroad must be paid for with imported foreign exchange. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Certain exports, including used equipment and ma- chinery, livestock, firearms, ammunition, explosives, and certain radio equipment, are prohibited regardless of destination. All other exports require a license, except those undertaken by state enterprises having a monopoly right to export. Some commodities may be exported, subject to individual prior approval, on the basis of linked transactions (transactions liees) involving at the same time an authorized import transaction. Since the promulgation of Law No. 78-02 of Feb- ruary 11, 1978, which conferred upon the Government a monopoly over foreign trade, exports may only be effected by public sector entities, unless a waiver is granted for a transitional period on a case-by-case basis. Exports must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Sales on consignment are subject to authorization by the Ministry of Finance, and registration must take place prior to customs clearance. Export proceeds must be re- patriated immediately after collection. Unless a waiver is granted by the Ministry of Finance or the Central Bank of Algeria, the time limit for repatriation of export pro- ceeds is 120 days from the date of shipment. However, for exports of hydrocarbons, the time limit is a maximum of 30 days after the completion of loading. Those petro- leum companies that hold mineral rights must repatriate to Algeria the proceeds from their exports of hydrocarbons, calculated on the basis of a contractual price a barrel that is fixed by agreement with the companies concerned. For one petroleum company holding mineral rights, how- ever, there are different repatriation requirements. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles must be repatriated and surrendered. Savings repatriated in the form of convert- ible currencies by Algerians working abroad are eligible for an encouragement premium. There are no restrictions on the import of foreign bank notes, coin (except gold ALGERIA coin), checks, and letters of credit, but nonresidents, including those of Algerian nationality, must declare such holdings when they enter Algeria. Resident travel- ers may reimport Algerian dinar bank notes up to DA 50 a person. Nonresident travelers are not permitted to bring in Algerian bank notes. Capital Residents are obliged to repatriate and surrender capital assets (or the sales proceeds thereof) held or acquired outside Algeria. Capital transfers to any destin- ation are subject to individual license; residents are not normally permitted to acquire capital assets outside Algeria. All borrowing abroad or from nonresidents is subject to prior approval by the Minister of Finance or the Central Bank. The Investment Code of September 15, 1966 provides for state guarantees in respect of foreign investments of more than DA 500,000 in the industrial and tourist sectors and for a retransfer guarantee in respect of the sale or liquidation proceeds of invested foreign capital. It also establishes that profit remittances on such invest- ments will be permitted up to 15 percent annually of the foreign capital originally invested. Tax facilities may also be granted, and investments of more than DA 5 million may be given exclusive rights in a specified geographic area and may be accorded tariff protection. Remittances of profits and retransfers of capital are permitted only in respect of investments approved under the code. The law on joint ventures with foreign companies, which came into effect in April 1982, provides foreign partners with a guarantee of fair return on investment, tax exemptions of up to five years on industrial and commercial profits, reduced taxes on reinvestment profits, and the repatriation of earnings and royalties in respect of transfers of technology. Gold Residents may purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in Algeria for numismatic purposes. Under Ordinance No. 70-6 of January 16, 1970, unworked gold for industrial and professional use is distributed by the Agence Nationale pour la Distribution et la Transformation de TOr et des Autres Metaux Precieux (AGENOR). This agency is also authorized to purchase in Algeria, and to hold, process, and distribute any other precious metal, and, within the exchange control regulations, to import and export any precious metal, including gold. Imports of gold for use by dentists and goldsmiths are made by AGENOR, under import licenses issued by the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank. Changes During 1984 Exports and Export Proceeds April 1. To promote nonhydrocarbon exports, authori- zation was given for special accounts (known as Expor- teur Dinar Algerien Comptes) to be opened by private exporters; up to the equivalent of 4 percent of the repatriated dinar value of exports could be held in such accounts (Circular No. 16, Ministry of Finance). As 59 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ALGERIA additional incentives, it was announced that official foreign exchange would be provided in the following cases: (a) overseas business travel, provided that the national carrier (Air Alge*rie) was used whenever possi- ble; (b) salaries and expenses of foreign technicians brought in for industrial maintenance; (c) related imports of essential spare parts and capital goods worth less than DA 100,000; (d) representation at overseas trade fairs and exhibitions; and (e) legal and administrative ex- penses. State exporters were also to be issued interna- tional credit cards. Imports and Import Payments June 2. The following regulations were introduced with respect to imports of cars without settlement of payment in Algeria: (a) importers should be of Algerian nationality and be permanent residents; (b) the weight of the car should not exceed 2,500 kilograms, and the exporter should obtain the agreement of a specified national enterprise, ENDVP; and (c) customs clearance should be done within one month. July 1. The public enterprises designated to handle specified imports were listed as follows: ENATB (furni- ture), ENAPAL (foodstuffs), and ENASEL (salt). August 1. The list of goods (explosives) to be exclusively imported by ONEX was published. September 1. The list of goods to be exclusively imported by ENATB was published (i.e., office furniture and equipment). 60 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Antigua and Barbuda is the Eastern Caribbean Dollar,1 which is issued by the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB). The Eastern Caribbean dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at ECS2.70 per US$1. On December 31, 1984 the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar quoted by the ECCB in its transactions with commercial banks were ECS2.6949 and ECS2.7084, respectively, per US$1. The ECCB also quotes daily rates for the Canadian dollar and the pound sterling. All foreign exchange transactions are subject to a levy of 1 percent; the minimum levy is EC$1 a transaction. Antigua and Barbuda formally accepted the obliga- tions of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement as from November 22, 1983. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Ministry of Finance and applies to all currencies. Export licensing is required for a range of products, particularly those subject to export duties. Import licenses are issued by the Collector of Customs in the Ministry of Finance and by the Ministry of Economic Development, depending on the type of commodity. Prescription of Currency Settlements with residents of member countries of the Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM)2 must be made either in the currency of the CARICOM country concerned or in Eastern Caribbean dollars. Settlements with resi- dents of other countries may be made either in any foreign currency or in Eastern Caribbean dollars. Set- tlements involving South African currency are not permitted. Nonresident Accounts External accounts may be opened for nonresidents with the approval of the Ministry of Finance and may be maintained in any currency. With the approval of the Ministry of Finance, such accounts may also be opened by resident individuals or firms in tourist-oriented industries or in export trades where most receipts are in foreign currency and a large portion of inputs are imported or are financed in foreign currency. External accounts can be credited with receipts from sales of merchandise (whether from export-oriented or local 'The Eastern Caribbean dollar is also the currency of Anguilla, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, St. Christopher and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. 2The CARICOM countries are Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Chris- topher and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. production) or from remittances. Commercial banks are required to report external accounts operations to the Ministry of Finance on a monthly basis. Imports and Import Payments All imports from South Africa are prohibited. Most goods may be freely imported under open general license granted by the Ministry of Finance. Certain other commodities require individual licenses, unless imported from CARICOM countries. Antigua and Barbuda follows the CARICOM rules of origin adopted in June 1981. Payments for authorized imports are permitted upon application and submission of documentary evidence. Authority is delegated to commercial banks to approve application forms for import licenses after confirming sight of documents. The approved forms must be submitted to the Ministry of Finance on a weekly basis. Imports that are exempt from import duties include basic foods and agricultural imports. All other exemp- tions, for machinery, equipment, and raw materials, are granted on a case-by-case basis and generally under the Fiscal Incentives Law and the Hotel Incentives Act. Import duties are levied at the rate of 35 percent in line with the CARICOM common external tariff. Payments for Invisibles Upon presentation of supporting documents, and with the authorization of the Ministry of Finance, residents may purchase foreign exchange up to the equivalent of US$750 a trip outside the ECCB area; however, this limit may be exceeded with permission from the Minis- try of Finance. In terms of CARICOM traveler's checks (which are denominated in Trinidad and Tobago cur- rency), the basic allowance is TT$500 a trip for holiday travel, TT$2,500 a trip for business, and TT$3,000 a trip for medical expenses. Official authorization is required beyond these limits. There are no limits on the amount of local currency that may be taken out of the country. Profits may be remitted in full, subject to confirmation by the Commission of Inland Revenue of registration for corporate income tax purposes. Student remittances are usually exempted from the foreign exchange levy. Exports and Export Proceeds No export licenses are required for certain com- modities to any destination. No surrender of export proceeds is required, and re-exports are not subject to any tax if they take place within the bonded area. Proceeds from Invisibles Travelers to Antigua and Barbuda may bring in freely notes and coins denominated in Eastern Caribbean dollars or in any foreign currency. Foreign currency coin is not normally exchanged. Checks and drafts in U.S. and Canadian currency can be tendered up to US$1,000 61 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA without restriction; for amounts over US$1,000, Minis- try of Finance approval must be obtained. Levy exemp- tions for transfers, especially for charity purposes, are usually granted. Capital There are no legislated restrictions on capital move- ments. Foreign investment is granted the same incentives as domestic investment under the Fiscal Incentives Law and the Hotel Incentives Act. Large transfers abroad for investment purposes can be phased over time by the Financial Secretary. Gold There are no restrictions on imports of gold. Changes During 1984 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 62 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ARGENTINA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement1 The currency of Argentina is the Peso Argentine. The exchange rate for the peso argentine in terms of U.S. dollars is announced on a daily basis by the Central Bank and adjusted in accordance with relative price move- ments and overall balance of payments objectives. On December 28, 1984 the closing rate for the U.S. dollar was $a 178.81 per US$1 (selling). Transactions are allowed in certain other currencies,2 with daily quota- tions based on the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar on markets abroad. Purchases and sales of foreign exchange are subject to a tax of 0.6 percent. Forward exchange operations are permitted in the private sector with maturities of up to 180 days and at rates agreed by buyers and sellers; such operations must be related to trade transactions. Argentina formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement as from May 14, 1968. Administration of Control All exchange transactions must be carried out through entities authorized expressly for this purpose. These authorized entities include banks, exchange agencies, exchange houses, and exchange offices; each of these types of institution may be subject to separate regulation. Prescription of Currency Virtually all payments between Argentina and Boli- via, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Vene- zuela are made through accounts maintained by the Central Bank of Argentina and the central banks con- cerned, under reciprocal credit agreements within the framework of the multilateral clearing system of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA). Argen- tina and Cuba maintain reciprocal credit arrangements by means of special accounts in each central bank, through which transactions between the two countries are settled; the limit under these accounts is US$10 million. Trans- actions with other countries must be settled in freely usable currencies. Nonresident Accounts Authorized banks may open accounts in pesos and in foreign exchange in the name of any nonresident, provided that the accounts are credited with remittances *As part of a set of adjustment measures, Argentina on June 14, 1985 introduced a new monetary unit, the Austral, at a conversion rate of A 1 = $a 1,000. 2Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds ster- ling, Portuguese escudos, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. of convertible currencies only. Balances on nonresident accounts may be used freely for any purpose, in Argentina or abroad. Transfers between accounts may be effected freely, except in payment for exports. Imports and Import Payments Import payments may be effected in convertible currencies, except as otherwise specified in the regula- tions on prescription of currency. Settlement of pay- ments for imports by the private sector may be freely effected by authorized financial entities, provided that the financing conforms to terms established by the Central Bank and that payment is effected not earlier than one or two days prior to the due date; otherwise prior central bank approval is required. Imports and related payments by the public sector require the prior approval of the Central Bank. In addition to customs duties, imports are subject to a stamp duty of 0.6 percent and selective internal taxes ranging from 5 percent to 22 percent. Most public and private sector imports require an import license (Certificate of Sworn Declaration of Need to Import) issued by the National Import Directorate of the Commerce Secretariat. An exception is made for imports of up to US$500 per month in any single customs classification by any single importer (subject also to an annual limit of US$6,000 per importer for each category of goods), which can be processed directly by the intervening bank without the prior issuance of an import license by the Commerce Secretariat. Certain public enterprises are also permitted to import under foreign treaties without the issuance of an import license. Import licenses are issued only after the importer has placed with a bank a deposit equal to either the estimated duty payable on the import, or 5 percent of the import value, in cases of lower or equivalent value. The deposits are blocked until the import duty is paid or for a period of 90 days, whichever is earlier; they are indexed in terms of the U.S. dollar. The following set of procedures apply to the acquisi- tion of an import license for all imports that require licensing. The import of goods classified as "nonessen- tial" (List I) is prohibited until June 30, 1985; this list consists primarily of consumer goods and of industrial inputs for which close substitutes are amply available in Argentina. The prohibition does not apply to temporary imports, to goods included in the border traffic scheme, or to samples and prototypes. The Secretary of Com- merce is empowered to grant import licenses for goods on List I when the import is considered necessary for scientific or technical reasons, or in light of the quantity or quality of domestic production. For most capital goods and certain industrial inputs (List II), the Commerce Secretariat issues import licenses 63 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ARGENTINA upon approval by the Industry Secretariat and by an Honorary Import Advisory Committee on which both government institutions and competent commercial and industrial organizations are represented. When the In- dustry Secretariat does not approve an import license request, the Commerce Secretariat is empowered to study the individual case and make a determination. Import licenses for certain raw materials and inputs for the pharmaceutical industry and for medical and health services (List III) require the prior approval of the Ministry of Health and Social Action, and licenses for imports intended for national defense and for the security and police forces require the prior approval of the Ministries of Defense or Interior. Import licenses are granted automatically for all goods not specifically covered by the foregoing provisions. Goods imported under concessions granted by any instrument of the LAIA agreement are exempt from the prohibition applicable to goods on List I and the review requirement for goods on List II. Import licenses are issued automatically for goods covered under the Argen- tine-Uruguayan Economic Cooperation Agreement. Once granted, an import license retains its validity for 120 days. The actual import value (f .o .b .) must be no more than 10 percent above the stated value of the sworn declaration submitted in application for an import license. Most imports are subject to minimum financing terms of at least 180 days, calculated from the date of shipment. However, imports of goods on the negotiated list from the LAIA have a minimum financing term of 90 days. Most other imports from Latin America, including those from the Central American Common Market (CACM), Cuba, Haiti, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, are subject to minimum financing terms of 120 days from shipment. Payment against shipping docu- ments is permitted in the following cases: goods im- ported from Brazil ("negotiated" goods), Mexico (goods under trade compensation programs), Peru (goods nego- tiated under LAIA Agreement No. 6), Uruguay (goods negotiated under the Partial Scope Agreement on Eco- nomic Complementation No. 1), and goods imported by Antarctica and the Islands of the South Atlantic and destined for the Special Customs Area established by Law No. 196403; fresh fruit received on consignment basis; and periodicals. Special minimum financing terms apply for imports of capital goods valued at more than US$50,000. Not more than 5 percent of the f.o.b. value may be settled prior to shipment and an additional 10 percent may be paid upon the submission of shipping documents. The balance of 85 percent is to be paid in equal installments beginning 3 Imports destined for the special customs area of Tierra del Fuego are subject to the following minimum financing terms: 75 days for imports on the "negotiated list" shipped from and originating in LAIA countries; 105 days for "non-negotiated" imports from the LAIA and imports from the CACM, Cuba, Haiti, Panama, or the Dominican Republic; and 150 days for imports from all other countries. 64 not earlier than six months after shipment, according to the following schedule: Value of Import (f.o.b.)

Payments for Invisibles Most payments for invisibles require prior approval by the Central Bank. In general, the sale of foreign exchange at the official rate is not permitted for travel abroad; however, in exceptional cases, the Central Bank may approve the sale of foreign exchange for travel abroad for medical treatment or for participation in trade fairs. Authorized entities may carry out the following transactions without consulting the Central Bank: (a) sale of foreign exchange for payment of banking fees, commissions, and interest in connection with import operations authorized individually or by general provi- sions; (b) at the request of Argentine exporters, sale of foreign exchange for the purchase of specifications for international competitive bidding; (c) freight charges for Argentine export and import operations; (d) remittances of funds received in pesos by foreign shipping compa- nies in Argentina, in connection with above-mentioned freight operations, after deducting local costs which, when appropriate, must be covered with funds received from abroad and negotiated in the foreign exchange market; and (e) settlement of expenditures incurred abroad by Argentine shipping companies, excluding costs relating to passenger services. Exports and Export Proceeds Minimum export prices (reference prices) are estab- lished for many agricultural and livestock exports as a basis for the payment of duties and the surrender of ex- port proceeds. The full f .o .b. proceeds from all exports must be repatriated and surrendered; the proceeds must not be less than the reference price, or if there is no reference price, the f .o .b. value declared on the shipping permit. Proceeds may be received in any convertible cur- rency. Proceeds from traditional exports must be re- ceived before shipment, by means of advance payments or irrevocable letters of credit payable against shipping documents in Argentina. Proceeds from promoted ex- ports must be repatriated within 180 days from the date ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution of shipment. In both cases, export proceeds must be surrendered within 15 working days from the respective time limits. Traditional exports are subject to export taxes. The applicable tax rates on December 31, 1984 were 18 percent for wheat; 31 percent for other grains and for live cattle; 24 percent for greasy wool; 18 percent for scoured wool; 11 percent for processed hides; and 16, 21, or 26 percent for other traditional exports.4 Certain nontraditional exports are eligible for rebates while others are subject to a small export tax; on December 31, 1984 the rebates amounted to 4 percent of export value and the export tax amounted to 1 percent of export value, depending on the type of export. Exports shipped through certain ports were eligible for additional rebates ranging from 7 to 12 percent. Many exports, particularly nontraditional exports, are eligible for other export incentives of various kinds. The Central Bank has established a system of special financ- ing, to be granted to Argentine exporters through banks, with a view to promoting exports of certain goods and services. The Argentine Export Credit Insurance Com- pany provides credit insurance against commercial and ordinary risks and also coverage for extraordinary risks (on the account of the Central Government) for exports of capital goods and other specified consumer goods. Certain products, mostly nontraditional exports, may be shipped "on consignment" for 360 days; if not sold within that period, the goods must be returned to Argentina.5 Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from freight and transportation services and from insurance and reinsurance activity must be surren- dered within 30 days of receipt. Exchange derived from other invisibles need not be surrendered. Travelers may bring in freely any amount in domestic or foreign bank notes and coin, as well as gold coin and "good delivery" gold bars. Capital Proceeds from financial loans must be sold in the exchange markets, as an eligibility condition for subse- quent sales of foreign exchange for amortizing such loans. Financial credits must have maturities of at least 180 days and in all cases must have fixed maturity dates. Principal and interest payments for loans received after November 28, 1984 may be effected directly through authorized entities on the maturity date without prior central bank authorization. All amortization payments for loans received prior to November 28, 1984 and 4 In February 1985, the export taxes on traditional exports were reduced by an average of 6 percentage points, effectively removing the increase imposed on October 29, 1984, with the exception of wheat, for which the tax had been removed earlier. 5 On January 25, 1985 various export incentives were introduced for nontraditional exports in accordance with the Export Promotion Law of December 16, 1984. Among these incentives are a deduction against taxable profits equal to 10 percent of the value of certain exports, the elimination of the export stamp tax of 0.5 percent for exports from the Federal Capital Area, and the creation of an Export Promotion Fund to finance trade fairs. ARGENTINA which are not related to import operations carried out in accordance with the minimum conditions specified for such payments, require prior central bank approval. All loans outstanding and covered by a swap agreement with the Central Bank as of December 4, 1982 and all loans for which the domestic borrower has obtained an exchange rate guarantee from the Central Bank must be extended under minimum terms established by the Central Bank. Currently, loans covered by swap agree- ments are to be repaid in four equal semiannual install- ments, with the first payment beginning 540 days after the final maturity of the swap agreement, except when loans are related to import transactions, in which case repayment will then be made in three quarterly install- ments beginning 270 days after the final maturity of the swap agreement. In lieu of providing foreign exchange to meet principal falling due on loans covered by exchange rate guarantees, the Government of Argentina permits three options for the creditor: (i) to accept a U.S. dollar-denominated Government of Argentina bond (BONOD) or promissory note with a grace period of three and a half years and a maturity of five years and yielding a spread of 2 percentage points over LIB OR, (ii) to renegotiate the loan directly with the private sector borrower on terms no shorter than the BONOD or promissory notes; in the latter case BONOD or promis- sory notes may be issued in guarantee, and (iii) to convert the loan into direct investment, in accordance with the provisions of the Foreign Investment Law. The Central Bank is in the process of establishing the rules to be followed in the refinancing of obligations due to commercial banks. Private sector obligations due to commercial banks that will be refinanced include (i) principal obligations falling due during the period April 1982 through 1985 that are not covered by exchange rate guarantees granted by the Republic of Argentina, and (ii) principal obligations falling due during 1984 and 1985 that are covered by exchange rate guarantees granted by the Republic of Argentina. There are also provisions for the regularization of unpaid interest over the period until the end of September 1985. The inflow of financial loans undertaken by local foreign-owned enterprises and originating from foreign enterprises which either directly or indirectly control the borrowing enterprises or are their subsidiaries requires the prior approval of the Central Bank. Loans endorsed or guaranteed by the State also require prior authoriza- tion from the Central Bank. Banks may accept foreign currency deposits with minimum maturities of seven days and lend the proceeds domestically at freely determined rates of interest. Foreign borrowing by the public sector is regulated by Decree-Law No. 19328 of October 29, 1971 and Decree No. 3532 of November 25, 1975. Outward capital transfers are subject to prior authorization by the Central Bank. The foreign investment regime is governed by the Foreign Investment Law (codified text of 1980), which incorporates the amendments made under Law No. 22208 to Law No. 21382. Promulgated by Decree 65 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ARGENTINA No. 1062 of June 30, 1980, the Foreign Investment Law is regulated by Decree No. 103 of January 19, 1981. Investments may be made in freely convertible foreign currency; new or used capital goods and their spare parts and accessories; profits and capital in Argentine currency belonging to foreign investors, provided that they are legally transferable abroad; capitalization of external credits received in freely convertible foreign currency; intangible assets; and any other form acceptable to the implementing authority or covered by a special regime or a promotion regime. For approval purposes, investments are classified into three categories, as follows: (1) Subject to prior approval by the National Execu- tive are (a) investments in the defense and national security sectors, in public service sectors including the postal system, electricity, gas, and telecommunications, and in radio transmitters, television stations, newspa- pers, periodicals and magazines, energy, education, and financial and insurance institutions; (b) transfers of capital and the acquisition of shares (the latter being permissible only in exceptional cases when it is mani- festly beneficial to the national economy), which involve changing the national ownership structure of a local firm belonging to national investors and having net assets exceeding US$10 million; (c) new transfers of freely convertible foreign currency not exceeding US$5 million and not involving a change in the national ownership structure of an existing local firm; (d) investment in any of Argentina's stock markets, provided that the amount does not exceed US$2 million for each foreign investor and so long as total foreign investment does not exceed 2 percent of the capital of the company involved; (e) investments where the investor is a juridical person under public law; and (f) investments where special or promotional benefits are requested that can be granted only by the National Executive and the proposed investment is contingent on them. (2) No prior approval is required for (a) total or partial reinvestment of a registered foreign investor's profits (even in the sectors referred to in item (1) above), provided that they do not involve changing the national ownership structure of the receiving firm and are intended to foster the activities for which the original investment was approved or in which the firm was engaged when the law entered into force; (b) new investments in freely convertible foreign currency made for the same purposes as mentioned in item (1) above, and not exceeding 30 percent of the registered capital in the receiving firm and which do not involve converting it into a "domestic firm with foreign capital," or new investments that are made pursuant to a preferential right and in order to maintain an interest equal to or lower than what was held up to that time; (c) new transfers of freely convertible foreign currency not exceeding US$5 million and not involving a change in the national ownership structure of an existing local firm; and (d) investment in any of Argentina's stock markets, provided that the amount does not exceed US$2 million for each foreign 66 investor and so long as total foreign investment does not exceed 2 percent of the capital of the company involved. (3) All other foreign investments are subject to prior approval by the implementing authority, which must give its decision within 120 days from the date on which the investment proposal is submitted. Foreign investments existing prior to the entry into force of the Foreign Investment Law are governed by its provisions, which include a special regime for their inscription and recognition. Existing and new foreign investments, as well as all capital movements relating thereto, may be recorded in the Register of Foreign Investments, which is kept by the Ministry of Economy. Registered foreign investments may generally be repatriated three years after entry into Argentina, unless a longer period was fixed when the investment was approved. The right to transfer profits and to repatriate capital related to properly registered investments can be suspended only by the National Executive. In that event, registered foreign investors are entitled to receive, for the remittance of profits abroad, the equivalent of the sum to be transferred in external public debt securities denominated in foreign currency, at the rate of interest prevailing in the international market, against provision of the equivalent in Argentine currency. Profits on registered foreign capital are subject to a special tax on after-tax profit when they exceed 12 per- cent of registered capital on an annual basis. This tax is 15 percent on profits of more than 12 percent and up to 15 percent of registered capital, 20 percent for those of more than 15 percent and up to 20 percent of registered capital, and 25 percent for those of more than 20 percent of registered capital. The extension of domestic credit to "domestic firms with foreign capital" is subject to special provisions, as set forth in Law No. 21382 (Article 17) and Decree No. 283/77 (Article 71, as amended in 1980). Gold Residents may hold gold coin and gold in any other form in Argentina or abroad. Financial institutions, exchange houses, and exchange agencies may buy or sell gold in the form of coin or "good delivery" bars among themselves or buy such gold from their clients. Gold exports must be paid for in convertible currencies. Imports of gold by industrial users are subject to a statistical duty of 0.6 percent, and those by other users are subject in addition to sales tax. Changes During 1984 Imports and Import Payments January 2. A new import regime, established by Presidential Decree No. 319 of December 29, 1983, came into effect. The import of goods included in a long list of customs tariff items (List I) was prohibited until June 30, 1984; this list consisted primarily of consumer goods and of industrial inputs amply available in Argentina. The prohibition did not apply to temporary imports, to goods included in the border traffic scheme, ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution or to samples and prototypes. Imports covered by irrevocable letters of credit opened before December 29, 1983 or financed under agreements concluded with international organizations before that date, were also exempted, and the Secretary of Commerce was em- powered to grant other exemptions when justified for technical reasons or in view of the quality of domestic production. For goods on another long list of customs tariff items (List II), the Commerce Secretariat would issue import licenses (Certificates of Sworn Declaration of Need to Import) upon approval by the Industry Secretariat and by an Honorary Import Advisory Committee comprised of representatives of government institutions and competent commercial and industrial organizations. List II included most capital goods and certain industrial inputs. (The same review procedure was prescribed for spare parts included in List I.) The Commerce Secretariat would issue licenses for imports of inputs for the pharmaceutical industry and for medical and health services (List III) upon the prior approval of the Ministry of Health and Social Action. Licenses for imports intended for national defense and for the security and police forces required the prior approval of the Ministries of Defense or Interior. Import licenses were to be granted automatically for all goods not specifically covered by the foregoing provisions. In addition, goods imported under concessions granted by any instrument of the LAIA agreement were exempt from the prohibition applicable to goods on List I and the review requirement for goods on List II. January 5. The import licensing system administered by the Secretary of Commerce was extended to include public sector imports. For imports covered by promo- tional regimes, license applications could be set forth in global terms. Import licenses were to be valid only for goods shipped after the license was issued. Authorized entities could effect payments for up to 5 percent more than the amount specified on the import licenses; in no case could the unit value differ by more than 3 percent from that specified in the import license. Except in the case of capital goods, import licenses were only valid for goods shipped within six months of the date of issue. All import licenses issued before December 28, 1983 and not used by January 2, 1984 were canceled. Resolution SC 382 of October 20, 1983, which had established an exchange budgeting system for imports, was rescinded (Resolution ME 6). January 5. It was established that import licenses would be issued only after the importer had placed with a bank a deposit equal to the f .o .b. amount specified on the license, multiplied either by the relevant import duty rate or by 5 percent, whichever was higher. The amount of the required deposit in Argentine currency was to be calculated using the selling rate of the Banco de la Na- cion at the close of the preceding business day. These deposits were to be blocked for 90 days and thereafter returned automatically to the importer (Resolution ME 8). ARGENTINA January 18. It was clarified that advance import deposits could be drawn down before the expiration of the normal 90-day period for which such deposits were blocked if the proceeds were used to pay associated import duties (Resolution ME 29). February 15. The import du ty on certain agricultural fertilizers was reduced to zero (Resolution ME 73). February 16. The Central Bank announced that authorized entities could effect import payments auto- matically, i .e ., without prior approval by the Central Bank, when the payment had fallen due in December 1983 or January 1984 and did not exceed the equivalent of US$20,000 (Communication C 1400). February 17. The Central Bank established that the advance import deposits introduced by Resolution ME 8 of January 5, 1984 would be indexed to the U .S. dollar (Communication A 454). February 24. Minimum foreign financing terms were established for imports destined for the Special Customs Area of Tierra del Fuego (Communication A 457). Previously, such imports had been exempt from mini- mum import financing terms. The minimum financing terms of the Special Customs Area, which are lower than those applicable generally, were as follows: (i) 75 days for goods on the "negotiated list" shipped from and originating in member countries of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA); (ii) 105 days for other goods shipped from and originating in the LAIA, as well as for goods shipped from and originating in the member countries of the Central American Common Market, Cuba, Haiti, Panama, or the Dominican Republic; and (iii) 150 days for imports from all other countries. February 29. The Central Bank announced that, with respect to import payments requiring the prior approval of the Central Bank, the importer must deposit the full domestic currency equivalent of the payment at the time an application to purchase the corresponding foreign exchange is submitted. (Payments for imports shipped after October 20, 1983 did not require prior central bank approval.) During the time between the submission of the application and the authorization of the payment, such deposits would accrue interest at the regulated rate (see entry for March 16, 1984). Imports into the Special Customs Area of Tierra del Fuego were exempt from the deposit. This requirement applied to applications sub- mitted from March 1, 1984 (Communication A 459). March 8. Authorized entities could effect automati- cally import payments between US$20,000 and US$50,000 that had become due in December 1983 (Communication C 1431). March 12. The amount by which payments for imports could differ from the f .o .b. value specified on the import license was increased from 5 percent to 10 percent of the f .o .b. value, and the amount by which the unit price could vary from that specified on the license was increased from 3 percent to 10 percent (Resolutions ME 181 and ME 296). March 15. Authorized entities were empowered to effect import payments automatically for individual 67 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ARGENTINA transactions of between US$50,000 and US$150,000 that had become due in October, November, or Decem- ber 1983 (Communication C 144). March 16. The provisions governing the deposit required at the time of submitting an application to purchase foreign exchange for import payments (see entry for February 29, 1984) were modified. Instead of accruing interest at the regulated rate, such deposits were to be indexed to the U.S. dollar effective from March 1, 1984 (Communication A 466). April 4. Authorized entities were empowered to effect import payments automatically for individual transac- tions of between US$150,000 and US$300,000 that had become due in October, November, or December of 1983 (Communication C 1472). April 5. It was decided that applications to import goods valued at less than US$500, up to an annual total of US$6,000 per importer for each category of goods, could be processed directly by the intervening bank without the prior issuance of an import license by the Commerce Secretariat. In addition, applications for imports that did not require the use of foreign exchange could be processed directly by customs (Resolution ME 277). April 23. Authorized entities were empowered to effect import payments automatically for individual transactions of up to US$50,000 that had become due in January 1984 and import payments of up to US$20,000 that had fallen due in February (Communication C 1489). May 3. Authorized entities were empowered to effect import payments automatically for individual transac- tions of between US$20,000 and US$50,000 that had fallen due in February 1984 and import payments of up to US$50,000 that had fallen due in March (Communica- tion C 1506). May 15. Authorized entities were empowered to effect automatically all import payments that had fallen due in February 1984 (Communication C 1526). June 13. Authorization was granted for import pay- ments for goods originating in Brazil and negotiated under the LAI A to be settled in full or in part against shipping documents or on credit. In addition, authorized entities were empowered to effect automatically import payments of up to US$100,000 that had fallen due in March 1984, except in the case of imports financed on terms longer than one year under credits granted or guaranteed before December 9, 1983 by foreign official institutions (Communication A 494). June 22. Authorized entities were permitted to effect automatically import payments of any amount that had fallen due in March, except for imports financed on terms longer than one year under credits granted or guaranteed before December 9, 1983 by foreign official institutions (Communication C 1566). June 29. The prohibition of imports of goods incor- porated in List I of Decree 319 (see entry for January 2, 1984), which would have expired on June 30, 1984, was extended until December 31, 1984. The Secretary of 68 Commerce was empowered to reject applications for licenses for imports from countries that adopted dis- criminatory measures against Argentine exports or that may have violated international agreements in a manner prejudicial to Argentine exports (Presidential Decree No. 2045). July 2. Authorized entities were empowered to effect import payments automatically for any amount that had fallen due in April, May, or June 1984, except for imports financed on terms longer than one year under credits granted or guaranteed before December 9, 1983 by foreign official institutions (Communication C 1588). August 3. About 1,400 tariff items were transferred from the list of imports for which licenses could be granted upon approval of the Commerce Secretariat (List II) to the list of prohibited imports (List I). Items transferred included many categories of machinery and equipment, as well as chemical products, prepared foods, tires, synthetic textiles, and various paper prod- ucts (Resolution ME 712). In addition, about 100 tariff items, primarily industrial inputs and equipment, were shifted from List II to the residual category of imports for which licenses are granted automatically (Resolution ME 608). November 6. Certain imports of raw material and intermediate goods were removed from Lists I and II and thereby became eligible for automatic import licensing (Resolution ME 1006). November 13. It was announced that imports other than capital goods originating in and shipped from Mexico under trade compensation programs could be paid for in full or in part against shipping documents (Communication A 552). November 23. It was announced that imports of products negotiated under the LAIA's Partial Scope Agreement No. 6 originating in and shipped from Peru, as well as imports under a program called the Partial Scope Agreement on Economic Complementation No. 1 between Argentina and Uruguay, were exempted from the minimum foreign financing requirement, and that payments for such goods could be effected upon presen- tation of shipping documents (Communication A 556). December 6. Certain public enterprises, including the national petroleum company (YPF), were exempted from the import deposit requirement with respect to imports purchased under an accord with the U .S .S .R. (Resolution ME 1130). December 28. The import system as introduced on January 2, 1984 and extended on June 29, 1984 was revised slightly and extended until June 30, 1985. New lists of prohibited items (List I) and items for which import licensing is subject to prior approval (List II) were published, incorporating the numerous changes that had taken place during the year. While the system of prohibited items, items requiring prior approval, and automatic licensing for remaining items was maintained, certain provisions of the system were altered as follows: the maximum period during which import licenses were to remain valid was reduced from 180 days to 120 days, ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution and for goods on List II, exemptions from prior approval requirements were granted for amounts up to US$1,000 per month for any single importer in any single customs tariff classification. This monthly limit was made subject to an annual limit of US$6,000 per importer for any given customs tariff classification and an overall annual limit of US$24,000 per importer (Presidential De- cree 4070 and Resolution ME 1325). Payments for Invisibles May 18. The right for foreign investors registered in conformity with the Foreign Investment Law (Law 21.382) to transfer profits and repatriate their capital was suspended. Registered investors did, however, have the right to receive U.S. dollar-denominated Government of Argentina bonds (BONOD) equivalent to the amount of profits they wished to transfer abroad (Presidential Decree No. 1506). May 22. It was decided that payments for expenses, commissions, and interest charges related to imports could be effected automatically at the same time that the respective import payment was made. Foreign exchange was also made available automatically for these specified charges relating to imports for which payments had already been authorized and effected (Communication C 1524). June 15. The Central Bank established that, with respect to international transportation services paid for in pesos in Argentina, foreign transportation firms or their agents could transfer abroad, by means of either foreign exchange or BONOD, only amounts corresponding to pesos received with respect to travel or transportation that had already commenced and after deducting local costs, including charges pending (Communication A 498). September 7. At the request of Argentine exporters, it was decided that foreign exchange could be sold directly for the purchase of specifications for international competitive bidding. November 15. The Central Bank suspended sales of foreign exchange for outward remittances of funds received in pesos by foreign transportation enterprises or their agents in Argentina from ticket sales and charges for excess baggage or unaccompanied baggage, regard- less of the means of transportation used (air, sea, river, or land). December 6. Authorization was granted for foreign exchange payments of fees, commissions, and interest (other than interest penalties) related to public sector imports to be made automatically with payment for the related imports.

January 18. The Central Bank announced that it would consider applications to capitalize, in accordance with the provisions of the Foreign Investment Law, amounts corresponding to loans for which the domestic borrower had obtained an exchange rate guarantee from the Central Bank (Communication B 952). June 4. For exchange rate guarantee contracts in which the premium paid for the exchange insurance was set equal to the difference between domestic interest rates and one-month LIBOR, the relevant domestic rate was changed from the regulated interest rate to the prevailing rate for bankers' acceptances.

Not for Redistribution guarantee contracts that had matured by December 31, 1983 (see entry for July 4, 1984) was extended to Au- gust 31, 1984. It was further provided that, with respect to loans with an original maturity of more than one year granted or guaranteed by foreign official institutions, the appropriate forms should be submitted but the BONOD or promissory note would not be issued, pending conclusion of Argentina's intended debt rescheduling discussions with the Paris Club (Communication A 511). August 28. The Central Bank announced a 180-day extension of the compulsory rollover of Argentina's private sector foreign loans covered by swap agreements with the Central Bank.

November 28. It was announced that financial credits received after this date through transactions in the single foreign exchange market should have maturities of at least 180 days, and should always have fixed maturity dates. In addition, principal and interest payments on such instruments should be effected directly through the authorized entity involved, without prior central bank authorization; the outward transfers should be effected in accordance with the originally specified maturity when ARGENTINA the credit was contracted and not more than two working days in advance. December 6. The Central Bank announced a scheme for the conversion into 120-day certificates of deposit, of private sector arrears on interest dating from the last quarter of 1983 that were due to foreign commercial banks. The conversion, in accordance with the refinanc- ing agreement with commercial banks, was intended to permit the regularization of arrears. The certificates of deposit were to be denominated in U .S. dollars and redeemed in U.S. dollars upon maturity. Private sector entities were entitled under the scheme to purchase foreign currency equivalent to 10 percent of interest on original maturities that were in arrears and transfer this amount directly to the creditor to liquidate the obliga- tion. For the remaining 90 percent of interest on original maturities and for accrued interest on arrears, private sector entities were to pay to the Central Bank the local currency counterpart of the obligation and to designate a local commercial bank to submit a U.S. dollar-denomi- nated 120-day certificate of deposit for an equivalent amount, made out to the foreign creditor (Communica- tion A 562). December 26.

Not for Redistribution AUSTRALIA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Australia is the Australian Dollar.l The Australian authorities do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions; exchange rates are determined on the basis of demand and supply conditions in the exchange market, but the Reserve Bank of Australia retains discretionary power to intervene in the foreign exchange market. On December 28, 1984 the closing buying and selling rates in terms of the U.S. dollar were $A 1.208 = US$1 and $A 1.209 = US$1, respectively. There are no taxes or subsidies on pur- chases or sales of foreign exchange. Trading banks and authorized nonbank financial in- stitutions are allowed to engage in foreign exchange transactions and may deal among themselves and with their customers at mutually negotiated rates. Dealers may hold foreign currency balances (spot and forward) or incur foreign currency liabilities (spot and forward) within limits established by the Reserve Bank for each dealer. In addition, there is a foreign currency hedge market in which dealers match the currency hedge requirements of their customers at market-determined rates. Nonresidents may transact business in this market, although it is a nondelivery market with all settlements effected in Australian dollars. Australia formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from July 1, 1965. Administration of Control Following abolition of most exchange controls on December 12, 1983, consent of the Reserve Bank continues to be required for a range of foreign transac- tions, so as to ensure conformance with the Govern- ment's tax and foreign investment policies. Such consent is conditional on clearance by the appropriate govern- ment authority. Import and export controls are imposed on certain commodities pursuant to the Customs Act. These controls are administered by the relevant Ministers and Departments according to regulations under that Act. Prescription of Currency Both outward and inward payments may be settled in Australian currency or in any foreign currency,2 but purchases and sales of foreign currency by residents in exchange for Australian currency must be undertaken with a bank in Australia. Nonresident Accounts Financial institutions in Australia are permitted to offer accounts denominated in foreign currencies, but purchases and sales of foreign currency must be handled through authorized foreign exchange dealers in Aus- tralia. However, special rules apply to overseas foreign exchange dealers, central banks, foreign governments, foreign government agencies not similar to private sector commercial entities, and intergovernmental organiza- tions; basically, they may hold essential working bal- ances and are not permitted to invest at interest. Nonresidents may withdraw their balances without restriction. Imports and Import Payments Nearly all goods may be imported without import licenses, and no restrictions are imposed on payments for imports. Import restrictions, including quotas, are im- posed on a small range of goods, although not for exchange control purposes; the restrictions are main- tained mainly for reasons of industry assistance, health, community protection, or security, or to sustain quality standards. There is provision in the Customs Tariff Antidumping Act 1975 for action to be taken when dumped imports have caused, are causing, or are threatening material injury to Australian industries. Dumping duties may be imposed unless the exporters voluntarily raise their export prices to the level necessary to remove injury. During 1983 a total of 101 complaints of alleged dumping were received, of which 51 were pursued. A total of 67 cases were completed during the year, of which 23 resulted in the imposition of dumping duties or the acceptance of price undertakings by the overseas exporter. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles are not in general restricted. Payments for royalties and service fees for certain countries and territories3 are subject to special tax screening procedures. Travelers may take out of Australia up to $ A 5,000 in Australian notes and coins in any combination. Travelers who are not residents of Australia may take out without formality any amount in foreign currency or Australian currency instruments (other than Australian dollar notes) provided that they brought them into Australia. Exports and Export Proceeds Export permits or licenses are not required except in respect of goods covered by the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations, Wildlife Protection Regulation of Exports and Imports Act, and regulations administered 1 The Australian dollar also circulates in a number of other countries, including Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu. 2 Foreign currencies are defined as all currencies other than the Australian dollar. 3These are listed as Bahamas, Bermuda, British Channel Islands, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, Grenada, Hong Kong, Isle of Man, Liberia, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Nauru, Netherlands Antilles, Panama, Switzerland, Tonga, and Vanuatu. 72 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution by the Department of Primary Industry to provide quality controls over certain primary products. There are no formalities covering the disposal of export proceeds. Under the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations, the export of certain minerals and metals, hydrocarbons, and nuclear sensitive material is prohibited unless per- mission to export is granted by the Minister for Trade or an authorized person. The regulations apply to certain raw or semiprocessed minerals, metals, fuels, and petroleum products. Export controls serve different objectives; for exam- ple, they are used to ensure that: (a) prices negotiated by Australian suppliers are in line with the market and that other terms and conditions of sales contracts are reasonable; (b) Australia is able to meet its international obliga- tions, e.g., under the international tin agreement; (c) exports of uranium and nuclear materials are consistent with Australia's international obligations; (d) domestic requirements of petroleum and petro- leum products are met before exports occur; (e) supplies of copper scrap and copper alloy scrap are reserved for local industry; and (f) the provisions of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act and the Australian Heritage Commission Act are taken into account. Close control is exercised in respect of alumina, bauxite, coal (including lignite), iron ore, petroleum and petroleum products, primary tin, uranium, and other materials of nuclear significance. Exporters are required to consult with the Government prior to the negotiation of contracts for sale of alumina, bauxite and coal, and determinations are made in relation to the negotiation of contracts for the sale of uranium. In relation to ores, concentrates, matte and oxides of copper, lead, mangan- ese, nickel, tungsten and zinc, blister and refined copper, lead bullion and salt, exporters, on application, are given automatic approval to export expected ship- ments over a twelve-month period. With respect to mineral sands, approvals to export are feely issued except where the Commonwealth considers there are environmental reasons which would make such export undesirable. In the case of monazite and xeno- time, however, there are additional requirements to be met in relation to the Government's nuclear safeguards policy before export approval can be given. Exports of copper scrap and copper alloy scrap are embargoed, and quotas apply to secondary copper ingots and other basic shapes made from scrap material. No other minerals are subject to control. Controls are available to facilitate the observance of Australia's obligations under international commodity agreements, to complement orderly marketing arrange- ments under Australian legislation, and to provide that domestic needs for certain agricultural and industrial inputs are satisfied ahead of export demands. With respect to rural commodities, the Government follows the general principle that exporters should be the main negotiators for export contracts and that the market AUSTRALIA should determine prices. Generally, the export control power is not used but is held in reserve to be used if and when the need arises, consistent with the need to protect the national interest and to meet market access limita- tions imposed by importing countries. There are also provisions for government control over the export of defense material. Controls also exist over exports of Australian-registered ships. These controls are exercised to ensure that an adequate fleet of vessels remains available for local purposes. Proceeds from Invisibles Earnings of invisibles in foreign currencies may be retained or sold for Australian dollars. Travelers may bring in any amount in foreign or domestic bank notes for travel expenditure. Capital Apart from transfers of capital (both direct and portfolio) and repayments of loans to certain countries (see footnote 3), which are subject to special tax screening procedures, there are no restrictions on the transfer of capital funds from Australia. Borrowing agreements with nonresidents of Australia and draw- downs under such agreements do not require approval. Nonresidents, except foreign governments, govern- ment agencies which are not similar to private sector commercial entities and intergovernmental organiza- tions, may undertake interest-bearing investments in Australia without formality. Portfolio investment (other than interest-bearing investment) and direct investment in Australia by non- residents are governed by the Government's foreign investment policy. The Australian Government's foreign investment policy is based on a recognition of the significant contribution that foreign capital can make to the development of Australia's industries and resources and the scope it provides for higher rates of growth in economic activity and employment than would otherwise be the case. The Government's policy is to encourage foreign investment provided such investment is consis- tent with Australia's national interests and meets the needs of the Australian community. Australia's foreign investment policy, is concerned primarily with direct investment by foreign interests having significant impli- cations for the levels of foreign ownership and foreign control of Australian industries and resources. Certain types of proposals are subject to examination by the Foreign Investment Review Board (which is the advisory body to the Government on foreign investment proposals). Examinable proposals include those falling within the scope of the Foreign Takeovers Act, those involving the establishment of a new business or project (irrespective of size) in industries subject to special restrictions (finance, insurance, the media, civil avia- tion, uranium and activities relating to uranium), or in other sectors where the total amount of the investment is $A 5 million or more (including diversification into activities not previously undertaken directly in Australia 73 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution AUSTRALIA and new projects in mining and other natural resource industries), those involving direct investments by foreign governments or their agencies (excluding investments related to their official representation), and those to acquire real estate and real estate development projects. The Foreign Takeovers Act is concerned with the acquisition of companies or businesses operating in Australia by foreign interests. The Act requires nonresi- dents, nonresident-controlled corporations or businesses and Australian companies in which nonresidents have a substantial shareholding to notify the Government of proposals to acquire, or alter, a substantial interest in a company. A substantial foreign interest is defined for the purposes of foreign investment policy as an interest of 15 percent or more in the ownership or voting power of a corporation or business by a single foreign interest either alone or together with associates, or an interest of 40 per- cent or more in aggregate in the ownership or voting power of a corporation or business by two or more foreign interests and their associates. The foreign investment examination process centers on three broad requirements concerning economic bene- fits, the provision of opportunities for Australian partici- pation, and specific Australian equity participation guidelines for certain sectors. Foreign investment pro- posals are examined on a case-by-case basis by the Government to ensure that they demonstrate economic benefits to Australia. The economic benefits are assessed in very broad terms covering such factors as more efficient use of resources, introduction of new technol- ogy, industry rationalization, and price-cost benefits. It is recognized, however, that these economic benefits have to be balanced against continuing community concern that the degree of foreign ownership and control should be kept within acceptable bounds. Government policy, therefore, seeks to ensure that genuine endeavors are made to provide opportunities for Australians to participate in the development of Australia's industries and natural resources. Specific equity guidelines (usually 50 percent Aus- tralian equity participation) are applied in respect of new natural resource development projects. Proposals for the establishment of new businesses or projects in the mining (other than uranium), agricultural, pastoral, fishing and forestry sectors involving a total investment of $A 5 million or more which are not contrary to the national interest are, as a general rule, only allowed to proceed if there is a minimum 50 percent Australian equity together with at least 50 percent of the voting strength on the board or controlling body of the project held by Australian interests. Proposals to establish new businesses in the nonbank financial sector, to acquire rural properties, and to develop real estate area, in certain circumstances, are also subject to specific Australian equity participation requirements. Requirements for Australian equity are, however, administered in a flexible manner; the extent of Aus- tralian participation being sought is made subject to the 74 particular commercial and other circumstances of each case. In particular, there is a concern that the unavaila- bility of sufficient Australian equity capital on rea- sonable commercial terms and conditions should not unduly delay the development of Australia's resources and industries. Foreign investment policy also provides an incentive for the "naturalization" of predominantly foreign-owned companies. This process is an entirely voluntary one for those companies which choose to increase the level of Australian participation in their Australian operations. Companies that elect to participate in these arrangements are entitled to certain benefits while they are natu- ralizing. They may be accorded prior credit for achieving majority Australian ownership, thereby facilitating their participation in certain new projects and ventures, subject to Australian equity participation guidelines. In the administration of policy, every effort is made to avoid unnecessary interference in normal commercial processes. Although recognition is given to the special characteristics and circumstances that may arise in individual cases, the policy is strictly nondiscriminatory as to the country of origin of investors: Foreign-controlled companies incorporated in Aus- tralia, or operating in Australia as locally registered foreign companies, may raise funds for their local requirements in the Australian capital market. Such foreign companies proposing to borrow locally are invited to consider alternative sources of financing, including the raising of local equity by means of new share issues or other placements.4 A range of outward foreign exchange transactions is subject to procedural requirements in order to meet the Government's taxation screening policies. A taxation clearance certificate issued by the Australian taxation office must be sighted by authorized foreign exchange dealers before foreign exchange or other means of payment is made available for certain transactions with residents of designated countries (see footnote 3) and for emigrants' remittances in excess of $A 50,000 or its currency equivalent to all countries. In respect of countries that are not designated for taxation screening purposes, foreign exchange dealers are obliged to require that their customers complete declaration forms on outflows of more than $A 50,000 or its foreign currency equivalent and which relate to investments, gifts, suste- nance and trust distributions, loans or loan repayments, travel expenditure, remittances relating to future opera- tions overseas and payments of interest, dividends, service fees, or royalties. Gold There are no restrictions on residents owning, buying, or selling gold and gold coin in Australia. Residents may export and import gold, subject to normal customs procedures. However, the export of Australian gold coin 4More details of Australia's foreign investment policy are contained in a government document, Australia's Foreign Investment Policy—A Guide for Investors. ©International Monetary Fund.

Not for Redistribution AUSTRIA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Austria is the Austrian Schilling. Without assuming any formal obligations, the authorities aim at maintaining a stable relation with the currencies participating in the European Monetary System (EMS). Forward premiums and discounts are, in principle, left to the interplay of market forces. On December 31, 1984 the authorized banks' buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were S 22.000 and S 22.100, respectively, per US$1. There are no exchange taxes or subsidies. Austria formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from August 1, 1962. Administration of Control The Austrian National Bank administers exchange control and issues exchange licenses where required. Most exchange transactions are effected through Aus- trian banks authorized to implement the exchange con- trol regulations. The customs authorities issue freely and without delay licenses required for imports of liberalized goods. Licenses, if required, for other imports and for exports have to be obtained from the relevant ministry, namely, the Federal Ministry of Trade, Commerce, and Industry (Licensing Office) for industrial products or the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry for agricultural products. For products falling under monopoly, licenses are issued by the Ministry of Finance. Prescription of Currency Settlements with all countries may be made either in convertible currencies or through Free Schilling Ac- counts. The exchange control regulations generally are based on the distinction between member countries of the IMF or the OECD with which settlements take place in convertible currencies and other countries with which settlements are made in convertible currencies. Nonresident Accounts There are three categories of nonresident accounts in schillings: Free Schilling Accounts, Interim Accounts for nonresidents residing in member countries of the IMF or the OECD, and Blocked Accounts for nonresidents residing in other countries. Free Schilling Accounts may be freely opened by Austrian credit institutions on behalf of nonresidents without any formality other than a check by the credit institution of the nonresident status of the beneficiary when the schilling funds are obtained from the selling of freely convertible foreign currencies at a domestic credit institution. Such accounts may be freely credited with proceeds from the sale of convertible currencies by a nonresident to the Austrian National Bank, or to an authorized bank, as well as with payments permitted by 76 the National Bank on the basis of a general or individual authorization. The accounts may be freely debited for payments to Austrian residents, who must, however, apply for individual licenses if they are to receive loans from nonresidents. Balances may be freely converted into any foreign currency. Transfers between these accounts are free. Interim Accounts and Blocked Accounts consist of funds that are due to nonresidents. General licenses permit their use for payments for many current and some capital transactions. The transfer abroad of funds in Interim Accounts and Blocked Accounts is subject to an individual license. Usually, licenses are granted freely if the funds belong to residents of countries that are members of the IMF or the OECD. Nonresidents may also maintain nonresident accounts in convertible foreign currencies. These accounts may be debited for the same purposes as Free Schilling Accounts and are subject to the same conditions. Imports and Import Payments All commodities not included in the Annexes to the Foreign Trade Law are free of import licensing and may be imported from any country without quantitative restriction. All goods included in the Annexes require licenses but most are free of quantitative restriction. For many goods licenses are granted by the customs, at the time of clearance, irrespective of the country they are imported from .1 Nearly all imports from GATT coun- tries, their associated territories, and some other coun- tries2 are liberalized. Austria's GATT liberalization is applied worldwide, except in respect of certain textiles and clothing as defined in Article XII, Section 1, of the Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles. The importation of coffee and sugar is governed by the 1 Goods liberalized for import from a given group of countries may be freely imported from any country in the group, provided that the country of exportation and the country of production of the goods involved are in the same group. 2The fu ll list is as follows: Algeria, Andorra, Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Australia, Bahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bar- bados, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi, Cameroon, Canada, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Chile, Colombia, Congo, Cuba, Cyprus, Denmark (including Faeroe Islands and Greenland), Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Fiji, Finland, France, Gabon, The Gambia, Federal Republic of Germany, Ghana, Greece, Grenada, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Ivory Coast, Jamaica, Democratic Kampuchea, Kenya, Kiribati, Korea, Kuwait, Lesotho, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, Malta, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mozambique, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Portugal, Qatar, Rwanda, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Swazi- land, Sweden, Switzerland, Tanzania, Togo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Tuvalu, Uganda, U .S .S .R ., United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Vanuatu, Peo- ple's Democratic Republic of Yemen, Yugoslavia, Zaire, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution international agreements for these commodities. Non- liberalized imports may be obtained under various procedures: namely, state trading, global quotas, bilat- eral quotas, discretionary licensing, and compensation (barter). State trading covers tobacco in any form, ethyl alcohol, and salt. Global quotas apply to specified imports from GATT countries; such quotas apply only to potatoes, wheat, and cornstarch, preserved meat, wine, and certain medicaments. Discretionary individual licen- sing is applicable to all other private imports not covered by the procedures listed above, including imports of certain textiles from specified countries. Licenses are usually granted if the imports concerned do not adversely affect domestic industries. Grains, milk and butter, and cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, and horses for slaughter and products from these animals for human consumption are imported in accordance with a special system of controls and regulations maintained under the Agricultural Marketing Law and the law governing livestock farming and trading and the mar- keting of livestock produce (Viehwirtschaftsgesetz). Cer- tain agricultural products are subject to import levies. In some cases, import licenses are issued only to importers who have received export certificates from the countries of their trading partners. Import licenses are not transferable and are valid for six months, but this period may be extended for periods of three months at a time. Payments for imports from, and originating in, countries with which Austria makes settlements in convertible currencies do not require exchange licenses. Under the 1982 Customs Preference Act, which covers the second ten-year period of the Austrian Scheme of Generalized Preferences, special treatment is provided for imports from the 31 least developed countries as defined by the UN General Assembly; the list of products eligible for preferential treatment has also been extended under the Act. Payments for Invisibles With few exceptions, residents are permitted to conclude transactions involving current invisibles with residents of countries that are members of the IMF or the OECD. Exceptions comprise certain transactions con- cerning transport and insurance. Most transactions in current invisibles that involve payments to residents of other countries (e.g., freight, commissions, and the cost of assembly and repairs) are covered by general licenses; for the remaining transactions, individual licenses are required. Payments on account of generally authorized invis- ibles to nonresidents may be made freely, provided that no capital transfer is involved. Other payments abroad up to S 2,000 may be made freely and at any time. The remaining payments on account of invisibles to countries other than members of the IMF and the OECD with which settlements are made in convertible currencies require special licenses. Residents traveling to countries with which Austria makes settlements in convertible currencies may buy AUSTRIA exchange from authorized banks or may obtain, as short- term advances from nonresidents in multilateral coun- tries, up to the equivalent of S 26,000 for each trip. Should a resident require more foreign exchange for traveling, additional amounts may be authorized by the National Bank. In addition, Austrian residents may arrange for trips abroad through travel agents and pay in schillings to cover expenditures for accommodation and food, as well as transportation. Persons leaving Austria may take with them S 15,000 in Austrian notes and coin and any amount in foreign notes and coin. Exports and Export Proceeds Licenses for exports regulated under the Foreign Trade Law have to be obtained from the relevant ministry or, at the time of clearance, from the customs authorities. For most exports, licenses are not required. Export licenses are issued with due consideration for the provisions of relevant bilateral trade agreements and the fulfillment of quotas established in accordance with such agreements, and for the needs of the Austrian economy. Export claims exceeding the equivalent of S 50,000 must be declared. Export proceeds may either be surrendered or be deposited in accounts with authorized banks. Such deposits in convertible currencies may be used freely for authorized payments abroad. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles must be declared within eight days from the date of collection. They may either be surrendered or be deposited with an authorized bank and subsequently are used in the same way as proceeds accruing from exports. Persons entering Aus- tria may bring in Austrian or foreign bank notes and coin without limit. Capital The acquisition by nonresidents of Austrian securities, shares and participations in Austrian companies, and Austrian real estate is covered by a general license. In certain provinces, the acquisition of real estate is subject to the approval of the local authorities. Direct invest- ments by nonresidents are also permitted by general authorization, if made with convertible currencies or from free or originally owned blocked schilling balances; for investments financed in other ways, authorization is granted on the merits of each case. Loans and credits extended by nonresidents to resi- dents, including those in schillings from Free Schilling Accounts, at present require prior approval by the National Bank and, in many cases, are restricted. Approvals are granted generally, but not exclusively, for (1) investment credits for productive enterprises, (2) import and export finance, and (3) loans from nonresident relatives to residents. Import credit with a maturity customary in the trade concerned is licensed freely. The short-term foreign assets and liabilities of autho- rized banks in convertible currencies are not subject to 77 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution AUSTRIA limitation. The National Bank licenses financial loans with maturities of more than one year to nonresidents only to the extent of funds made available through the redemption of such loans outstanding at the end of December of the previous year, plus 15 percent. A number of authorized banks are permitted to accept convertible currencies from abroad for interbank on- lending abroad at maturities of up to five years. Mortgage loans, export finance credits, and loans to Austrian subsidiaries abroad are not subject to this limit. Transactions and operations mentioned in the follow- ing three paragraphs are licensed upon documentation, provided that they are concluded with residents of countries that are members of the IMF or the OECD. The National Bank permits the transfer abroad of (1) proceeds from the liquidation of various foreign investments in Austria (shares or participations in Aus- trian enterprises, Austrian securities, and real estate in Austria) and (2) repayments by residents of foreign loans and credits. The transfer of funds owned by emigrants and pay- ments due to nonresidents on account of dowries, inheritances, and settlements under certain agreements between heirs are permitted. Residents may also grant loans to nonresident relatives, provided that the lender draws on his own resources. Residents are allowed, for purposes of direct invest- ment, to acquire participation rights in foreign compa- nies, associations, and other enterprises, and to estab- lish, acquire, or extend foreign agencies or. individually owned firms; earnings accruing from such investment usually may be reinvested. Residents also are permitted to acquire real estate abroad for the purpose of establish- ing a secondary residence, that is, intended for the personal use of the buyer within one year, to grant commercial or investment credits (provided that, in the latter case, the proceeds of the credit are used within Austria), to grant direct investment loans (provided that the resident can actually exert influence on the manage- ment of the nonresident enterprise), and to grant credits secured by mortgages in Austria or abroad. Domestic insurance companies may conclude life insurance con- tracts in Austria with nonresidents. Residents are allowed to purchase from nonresidents, without restriction, foreign securities issued in member countries of the IMF or the OECD with which set- tlements take place in convertible currencies and regis- tered on stock exchanges3 and Austrian securities; for foreign securities and Austrian external bonds, the transactions must be carried out on a spot basis through authorized banks and, with certain exceptions (e.g., in the case of securities listed on the Vienna Stock 3 The general license does not apply to the purchase by residents from nonresidents of securities of a participating nature in whatever legal form (including shares) that are issued by foreign investment funds or by similar institutions of whatever kind which assemble assets for the purpose of risk spreading. Individual licenses are issued automatically when the purchase takes place on a recognized foreign stock exchange or when the issuing institution is subject to adequate surveillance. 78 Exchange), the securities purchased must be kept with such banks. Payments for these purchases to nonresi- dents may be made in convertible currencies. Residents may sell foreign securities and Austrian external bonds to nonresidents only on a spot basis against payment in convertible currencies and, for securities deposited with Austrian authorized banks, only through such banks. Gold Transactions in gold (excluding jewelry and medal- lions, which are considered jewelry) are governed by the Foreign Exchange Law. The National Bank is authorized by this law to deal in gold as defined therein; the Bank has granted a number of general permissions widely liberalizing the domestic gold trade, but does not itself buy or sell gold or gold coin, except in transactions with monetary authorities of other countries or with interna- tional financial institutions. The Bank has authorized credit institutions, exchange offices, and coin dealers to buy or sell in Austria on their own behalf or on behalf of their customers (including nonresidents) gold coin that is not legal tender; the prices are based on those for coin and unmanufactured gold in free markets abroad. A general license also permits other residents to purchase and sell among themselves, in Austria and against payment in schillings, gold coin that is not legal tender. The Mint releases certain types of gold coin (restrikes) to authorized credit institutions for resale to the public. It has also issued a commemorative gold coin with a face value of S 1,000, which is legal tender. Residents may hold gold in any form, including bars, in Austria, and they may acquire in Austria any gold coin that is not legal tender and any gold medals or medallions; further- more, domestic trading between residents in gold with a fineness of less than 0.585 is unrestricted. With the exception of coin, medals, and gold with a fineness of less than 0.585, the acquisition from residents of gold subject to the Foreign Exchange Law is reserved for the monetary authorities, authorized industrial users, den- tists, and jewelers; the Mint, gold refiners, and jewelers are permitted to trade or exchange gold in any form among themselves. Domestic sales of gold coins that are not legal tender are subject to value-added tax which is at the general rate of 32 percent and for gold coins at the rate of 20 percent, in accordance with the Gold Coin Law 1964. Where the Foreign Trade Law prescribes import licenses for gold imports (e .g ., for gold sheets), the license is issued either by the Ministry of Trade, Commerce, and Industry to industrial users or by the customs office concerned, which issues licenses automa- tically for certain gold imports within its jurisdiction. Where this law does not require an import license (e.g., for the import of gold bars), the Foreign Exchange Law prescribes a license issued by the National Bank covering the purchase of gold. Exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require authorization by the National Bank; the Bank has issued a general license ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution permitting nonresident travelers to take out coin that is not legal tender up to a weight of 200 grams a person a trip and allowing resident travelers to specified member countries to export such coin up to a value of S 2,000 a person a trip. The National Bank's imports and exports do not require import, exchange, or export licenses. Commercial imports of jewelry and of articles containing a minor amount of gold, such as watches, are liberalized, licenses being issued automatically by the customs authorities; commercial exports of a number of such articles, however, must be licensed by the Ministry of Trade, Commerce, and Industry. Changes During 1984 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. AUSTRIA 79 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BAHAMAS (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Bahamas is the Bahamian Dollar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at B$l = US$1. The U .S. dollar circulates concurrently with the Bahamian dollar. The official buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar are B$l .0025 and B$1.0040, respectively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates for the pound sterling are also officially quoted, the buying rate being based on the New York market mid-rate, and the selling rate 0.5 percent above the buying rate. The Central Bank of the Bahamas deals only with commercial banks. For transactions with the public, commercial banks are authorized to charge a commission of 0.50 percent buying and 0.75 percent selling, per US$1, and 0.50 percent buying or selling per £ stg. 1. These charges are additional to the Central Bank's charges. A stamp tax of B$0.10 is applied to all outward remittances where the amount is B$30 or less. A further tax of B$0.10 is levied on every additional B$30 or fraction thereof. There is also a market in which "investment currency"1 may be negotiated between residents through an investment currency dealer at freely determined rates, usually attracting a premium over the official market rate. On December 31, 1984 the bid and offer rates reflecting this premium were 15 percent and 20 percent, respectively. The Bahamas formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agree- ment, as from December 5, 1973. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Central Bank, which delegates to authorized dealers the authority to approve allocations of foreign exchange for certain current payments; the approval authority for import payments, travel exchange, and cash gifts is not dele- gated, except in Grand Bahama and the Family Islands. Import and export licenses are not required except for crawfish, conch, arms and ammunition, and, in certain cases, industrial gold. The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries issues export licenses for crawfish and conch, and the Police Department issues import and export licenses for arms and ammunition. Imports of industrial gold are licensed by the Central Bank. !This is foreign currency in respect of which there is a general or specific central bank permission that it may be retained and used or disposed of as investment currency. Such permission may exist in respect of foreign currency accruing to residents of the Bahamas from the sale or redemption of foreign currency securities or the sale, liquidation, redemption, or realization of property or of direct investments outside the Bahamas. The use of investment currency is prescribed for the purchase from nonresidents of foreign currency securities and the making of direct investments outside the Bahamas. 80 Prescription of Currency The exchange control system of the Bahamas makes no distinction between foreign territories. Settlements with residents of foreign countries may be made in any foreign currency2 or in Bahamian dollars through an External Account. Nonresident Accounts Authorized banks may freely open External Accounts denominated in Bahamian dollars for winter residents and for persons with residency permits but without work permits. With the prior approval of the Central Bank, authorized banks may also open External Accounts in Bahamian dollars for nonresident companies that have local expenses in the Bahamas and for nonresident investors. External Accounts in Bahamian dollars are normally funded entirely from foreign currency originat- ing outside the Bahamas, but income on registered investments may also be credited to these accounts with the Central Bank's approval. Balances may be converted freely into foreign currency and transferred abroad.3 Accounts which are credited with funds that may not be placed at the free disposal of nonresidents are designated Blocked Accounts. These are held mainly by emigrants. Where the value of an emigrant's assets exceeds B$25,000, the excess is credited to a Blocked Account. Balances on Blocked Accounts are transferable through the official exchange market after four years or through the investment currency market at any time; they may also be invested, with the Central Bank's approval, in certain resident-held assets or be spent locally for any other purpose. Imports and Import Payments The importation of certain commodities is prohibited or controlled because of health, social, or humanitarian reasons. All other goods may be imported without a license. The prior approval of the Central Bank is required for making payments for imports, irrespective of origin;4 this approval is normally given automatically upon submission of pro forma invoices or other relevant documents proving the existence of a purchase contract. Import duties vary from 0 to 200 percent, depending on the type of goods. Customs entries are subject to a stamp tax at a rate of 11/2 percent. Payments for Invisibles There are no restrictions on current payments. Autho- rized dealers can make payments to nonresidents on 2 Foreign currencies comprise all currencies other than the Bahamian dollar. 3 Persons of foreign nationality who have been granted "temporary resident" status are treated in some respects as nonresidents but are not permitted to hold External Accounts. 4Except in Grand Bahama and the Family Islands, where this authority is delegated to clearing bank branches. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution behalf of residents for certain services and other invis- ibles within specified limits. Such payments include freight, ships' disbursements, commissions, royalties, and insurance payments. Residents are entitled, on application to the Central Bank, to a foreign currency travel allowance of the equivalent of B$l ,000 a person a year for tourist travel and of B$5,000 a person a year for genuine business or professional travel. The allowance of B$ 1,000 for tourist travel excludes the cost of fares and travel services, which are normally obtained against payment in Bahamian dollars to a travel agent in the Bahamas. Applications for foreign exchange in excess of these amounts must be referred to the Central Bank, which approves bona fide applications. Foreign ex- change facilities obtained for travel may not be retained abroad or be used abroad for purposes other than travel; any unused balance must be surrendered within a week of issue or, if the traveler is still abroad, within one week of his return to the Bahamas. Subject to adequate documentary evidence, an education allowance of up to B$6,000 a person an academic year is normally granted upon application. Applications for facilities in excess of this amount are referred to the Central Bank. Temporary residents may remit up to 50 percent of their wages and salaries, but where commitments outside the Bahamas are larger than 50 percent of wages and salaries, additional amounts may be remitted. A traveler may take out Bahamian bank notes not exceeding B$70 in value and notes of any other country not exceeding US$1,000 in value. Exports and Export Proceeds Export licenses are not required except for crawfish, conch, and arms and ammunition. The proceeds of exports must be offered for sale to an authorized dealer as soon as the goods have reached their destination or within six months of shipment; alternatively, export proceeds may be used in any manner acceptable to the Central Bank. Proceeds from Invisibles Residents are obliged to collect without delay all amounts due to them from nonresidents and to offer the foreign currency proceeds for sale to an authorized dealer without delay, but these requirements are seldom enforced. There are no restrictions on the import of foreign bank notes. The import of domestic bank notes is subject to the approval of the Central Bank. Capital All capital transfers to countries outside the Bahamas require exchange control approval and outflows of resident-owned capital are restricted. Inward transfers do not require exchange control approval, although the subsequent utilization of the funds in the Bahamas may require authorization. The permission of the Central Bank is required in respect of any action whereby nonresidents acquire control of an incorporated company BAHAMAS controlled by residents. Resident individuals and compa- nies require the specific permission of the Central Bank to maintain bank accounts outside the Bahamas.5 The use of official exchange for direct investment abroad is limited to B$100,000 or 30 percent of the total cost of the investment, whichever is greater, for invest- ments from which the additional benefits expected to accrue to the balance of payments from export receipts, profits, or other earnings within 18 months of the investment will at least equal the total amount of investment and will continue thereafter. Investments abroad that do not meet the above criteria may be financed by foreign currency borrowed on suitable terms subject to individual approval by the Central Bank, the purchase of foreign currency in the investment currency market, or the use of retained profits of foreign sub- sidiary companies. Permission is not given for invest- ments that are likely to have adverse effects on the balance of payments. In principle, inward investment by nonresidents is unrestricted. However, the consent of the Central Bank is required for the issue or transfer of shares in a Bahamian company to a nonresident and for the transfer of control of a Bahamian company to a nonresident. Special procedures apply to investments in the form of purchase of real property, as specified under the Immov- able Property (Acquisition by Foreign Persons) Act, 1981, which came into effect on November 1, 1983: foreigners intending to purchase land must make applica- tion to the Foreign Investments Board, a group of seven designated ministers of the Government. If such applica- tion is approved, payment for the purchase may be made either in Bahamian dollars from an External Account or in foreign currency. For all investments with approved status, permission is given upon application for the transfer of profits and dividends, representing earned trading profits and invest- ment income. In the event of a sale or liquidation, nonresident investors are permitted to repatriate the proceeds, including any capital appreciation, through the official foreign exchange market. Residents require the specific approval of the Central Bank to buy property outside the Bahamas; such pur- chases, if for personal use, can be made only with investment currency, and approval is limited to one property for each family. Any incidental expenses connected with the purchase of property for personal use may normally be met with investment currency; expendi- tures necessary for the maintenance of the property or arising directly from its ownership may, with permis- sion, be met with foreign currency bought at the current market rate in the official foreign exchange market. The transfer of legacies and inheritances due to nonresident beneficiaries under wills or intestacies of persons who were Bahamian residents at the time of their 5 Banks and trusts established in the Bahamas are exempt from certain exchange control regulations, particularly with regard to their offshore operations. 81 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BAHAMAS death is permitted. However, permission is not normally given for Bahamian residents to settle any property, other than by will, for the benefit of nonresidents. A resident may make cash gifts to nonresidents not exceeding a total of B$ 1,000 a donor each year. This amount may be exceeded, with permission, in special circumstances. Foreign nationals domiciled in the Bahamas, even if considered resident for exchange control purposes, may be eligible for a measure of exemption from certain exchange control obligations, notably with respect to the mandatory deposit of foreign currency securities and the surrender of certain other foreign capital assets. Nonresident buyers of Bahamian securities must pay for such purchases in Bahamian dollars from an External Account, in funds eligible for credit to an External Account, or in Bahamian dollars arising from the sale of foreign currency in the official foreign exchange market; interest, dividends, and capital payments on such securi- ties may not be remitted outside the Bahamas unless the holdings have been properly acquired by nonresidents. Bahamian residents are not permitted to purchase foreign currency securities with official exchange or out of export proceeds or other current earnings; payment must be made with investment currency. All purchases, sales, and switches of foreign currency securities in the Bahamas and all switches in foreign currency securities by Bahamian residents, wherever the switch takes place, require permission from the Central Bank, and all transactions must take place through authorized agents.6 All foreign securities purchased by residents of the Bahamas must be held to the order of an authorized agent. Securities of other former Sterling Area countries are considered foreign currency securities, and sales proceeds of such securities held by residents, if regis- tered at the Central Bank by December 31, 1972, are eligible for sale in the investment currency market; securities not so registered may be offered for sale at the official rate of exchange. Residents leaving the country with the intention of residing permanently outside the Bahamas are redesig- nated upon departure as nonresidents. Under normal rules persons leaving the Bahamas to take up residence elsewhere may transfer, at the current market rate in the official foreign exchange market, up to B$25,000 of their Bahamian dollar assets to the new country of residence, and may also take normal household and personal effects with them. When the total value of their Bahamian dollar assets is over B$25,000, the excess is transferable through the official exchange market after four years, or through the investment currency market at any time. After a person's redesignation as a nonresi- dent, income accruing from his assets remaining in the Bahamas is normally remittable at the current market rate in the official foreign exchange market. 6 These are 11 banks and trust companies authorized to deal in Bahamian and foreign currency securities and to receive securities in deposit. 82 Residents other than authorized banks require permis- sion to borrow foreign currency from nonresidents, and authorized dealers are subject to exchange control directions with regard to their lending of foreign cur- rency to residents. Residents also require permission to pay interest on, and to repay the principal of, foreign currency loans by conversion of Bahamian dollars. When permission is granted for residents to accept foreign currency loans, such permission is normally conditional upon the currency being offered for sale without delay to an authorized dealer, unless the funds are required to meet payments to nonresidents for which permission has been specifically given. A resident company that is wholly owned by nonresi- dents is not normally allowed to raise working capital in Bahamian dollars unless such funds are a small propor- tion of the total investment. If the company is partly owned by residents, the amount of such local currency borrowing is normally determined in relation to the nonresident interest in the equity of the company. Banks and other lenders resident in the Bahamas require permission before they extend loans in domestic cur- rency to any corporate body (other than a bank), which is resident in the Bahamas and is by any means controlled, whether directly or indirectly, by nonresidents. How- ever, companies that are set up by nonresidents primarily to import and distribute products manufactured outside the Bahamas are not normally allowed to borrow Bahamian dollars from residents either for fixed or working capital but must provide all their finance in foreign currency; borrowings in a foreign currency normally are permitted on application. Gold Residents of the Bahamas other than authorized dealers are not permitted to hold or deal in gold bullion. Those residents, however, who are known users of gold for industrial purposes may, with the approval of the Central Bank, meet their current industrial requirements. Import licenses are freely issued by the Central Bank to industrial users. Authorized dealers are not required to obtain licenses for bullion or coin. Commercial imports of gold jewelry do not require a license. There is no import duty on gold bullion or gold coin; however, an import duty of 32.5 percent is imposed on imports of gold jewelry from all sources. A 1.5 percent stamp tax payable to the customs is also payable on commercial shipments of gold jewelry from any source. There is no restriction on the acquisition or retention by residents of gold coin. The Bahamas has issued commemorative coins in denominations of B$10, B$20, B$50, B$100, B$150, B$200, B$250, B$l,000, and B$2,500 in gold, and B$10 and B$25 in silver; these are legal tender but do not circulate. Changes During 1984 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BAHRAIN (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Bahrain is the Bahrain Dinar, which is pegged to the SDR at the rate of BD 0.476190 = SDR 1. Bahrain sets exchange rates for the Bahrain dinar within margins of plus or minus 7.25 percent of the fixed relationship between the Bahrain dinar and the SDR; in practice, the Bahrain dinar maintains a relatively stable relationship with the U .S. dollar, the intervention cur- rency. Since December 1980, the exchange rate has remained unchanged at BD 1 = US$2.6596. With the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies, the exchange rate of the dinar in terms of the SDR has been outside the 7.25 percent margin since May 1981. The middle rate of the Bahrain dinar for the U .S. dollar quoted by the Bahrain Monetary Agency is adjusted from time to time. The Agency also quotes daily rates for the pound sterling and the deutsche mark based on the latest available rates for the U .S. dollar against those currencies. On December 31, 1984 the Agency's buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were BD 0.375 and BD 0.377, respectively, per US$1. The Agency does not deal with the public. In their dealings with the public, commercial banks are required to use the Agency's rates for U.S. dollars, pounds sterling, and deutsche mark, but they are authorized to charge an exchange commission of 2 per mill (special rates of commission apply for transactions up to BD 1,000). The banks' rates for other currencies are based on the Agency's rates for the U .S. dollar and the New York market rate for the currency concerned against the U .S. dollar. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Bahrain formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from March 20, 1973. Administration of Control The Agency is the exchange control authority, but there is no exchange control legislation in Bahrain. No import or export licenses are required (except for arms and ammunition, television cameras, and alcoholic beverages). However, importers and exporters must be registered with the commercial registry maintained by the Ministry of Commerce and Agriculture and must be members of the Bahrain Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Prescription of Currency All settlements with Israel are prohibited. Otherwise, no requirements are imposed on exchange payments or receipts. Nonresident Accounts A distinction is made between accounts held by residents and those held by nonresidents. Offshore banking units are not normally permitted to hold resident accounts. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Israel are prohibited, as are products manufactured by foreign companies that are blacklisted by the League of Arab States. Imports of a few commodities are prohibited from all sources for reasons of health, public policy, or security. Imports of cultured pearls also are prohibited. Import licenses are required for arms and ammunition, television cameras, and alcoholic beverages. Rice and sugar are, in practice, imported only by the Bahrain Import-Export Company. Exchange for payments in respect of permitted imports may be obtained freely. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Israel are prohibited, and exports of certain refined petroleum products to South Africa have been suspended. Otherwise, all commodities may be exported freely. There are no requirements attached to receipts from exports or re-exports; the proceeds need not be repatriated or surrendered, and they may be disposed of freely, regardless of the currency involved. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments for and proceeds from invisibles are not restricted, except that payments must not be made to or received from Israel. Travelers may bring in or take out of Bahrain any amount in domestic or foreign bank notes. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or payments by residents or nonresidents, but payments may not be made to or received from Israel. Profits from foreign investments in Bahrain may be transferred abroad freely, with the exception that under Article 72 of the Monetary Agency Law the banks are subject to special rules regarding the payment of dividends and the remittance of their profits. Licensed offshore banking units may freely engage in transactions with nonresidents; transactions with residents are not normally permitted. The Ministry of Commerce and Agriculture operates a center for the dissemination of information on the stock exchange. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form are freely permitted and do not require a license. Imports of gold jewelry are subject to a 10 per- cent customs duty but gold ingots are exempt. Brokerage business in gold (as well as other commodities) requires approval from the Bahrain Monetary Agency before 83 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BAHRAIN registering with the Ministry of Commerce and Agricul- ture; such business is subject to a minimum deposit requirement equivalent in the case of gold to BD 3,000 or 10 percent of the contract value, whichever is higher. Changes During 1984 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 84 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BANGLADESH (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Bangladesh is the Bangladesh Taka. The value of the taka in terms of the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, is determined on the basis of a weighted basket of currencies. Changes in the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar are generally made when fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U .S. dollar and the currencies in the basket exceed 1 percent in either direction. On December 31, 1984 the official (spot) middle rate of the taka in terms of the U.S. dollar was Tk 26.00 = US$1. On December 31, 1984 the spot buying and selling rates of the Bangladesh Bank (the central bank) for authorized dealers were Tk 25.97 and Tk 26.03, respectively, per US$1. On the same date the spot buying and selling rates (telegraphic transfers) of authorized dealers were Tk 25.9387 and Tk 26.0613, respectively, per US$1. Exchange rates for currencies other than the U .S. dollar are based on the U .S. dollar closing rates in New York for the currencies concerned. A different effective exchange rate arises through the operation of the Wage Earners' Scheme and the Export Performance Licensing Scheme. Under the former scheme, exchange earnings remitted by workers abroad are auctioned or sold by the wage earners or their representatives to eligible users or banks on a bilateral basis at rates established by a Wage Earners' Rates Committee constituted by the Bangladesh Bank; foreign exchange purchased under this scheme may be used for specified imports, expenditure on foreign travel, and other approved purposes. Under the Export Performance Licensing Scheme, exporters of nontraditional products receive freely negotiable import entitlement certificates that may be used for the same purposes; and certificates may also be sold in the secondary exchange markets. On December 31, 1984 the middle exchange rate in the secondary market was Tk 29.525 per US$1 and Tk 34.495 per £ stg. 1. Forward transactions of the Bangladesh Bank are confined to purchases and sales of deutsche mark, French francs, Japanese yen, pounds sterling, U .S. dollars, and currencies of the member countries of the Asian Clearing Un ion .l Forward facilities at authorized banks covering periods of up to six months are available in all approved foreign currencies for export proceeds and for import payments. Forward exchange facilities for three months are available for remittances of surplus collection of foreign shipping companies and foreign airlines. For settlement of transactions under the Asian Clearing Union, the Bangladesh Bank also purchases, both spot and forward, the Asian Monetary Unit (AMU);2 it also sells the AMU for spot delivery. Members of the Asian Clearing Union are Bangladesh, Burma, India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. 2 The AMU is equivalent in value to the SDR and is used for recording the value of transactions passing through the Union. Upon payment of an annual premium of 2.5 percent, the exchange risk on public or private foreign currency loans that will be fully or partly disbursed by June 30, 1988 may be given forward exchange cover by the Bangladesh Bank under the Exchange Rate Fluctuation Burden Absorption Scheme. The full amount of the exchange risk may be covered in respect of loans disbursed after July 1, 1983, but the scheme applies to only a specified proportion of loans fully disbursed prior to that date. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Bangladesh Bank in accordance with general policy formulated in consultation with the Ministry of Finance. The seven foreign and ten domestic commercial banks (of which six are nationalized), together with two joint-venture banks and three specialized financial institutions, have been appointed authorized dealers (authorized banks) in foreign exchange. The Chief Controller of Imports and Exports of the Ministry of Commerce is responsible for the issuance of import licenses. Certain trade transac- tions are conducted through state-trading agencies, in- cluding the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB). Prescription of Currency Settlements with all countries are subject to exchange control. Settlements with countries with which Bangla- desh has commodity exchange agreements3 normally must be effected through nonconvertible U.S. dollar or pound sterling accounts for goods and services specified in the agreements; settlement with these countries can be made in convertible currencies for goods and services not specified in the agreements. Payments to, and receipts from, the other member countries of the Asian Clearing Union in respect of current transactions (other than those relating to petroleum and natural gas and their products) must be effected in Asian Monetary Units through the Clearing Union.4 Settlements with other countries normally take place in sterling and other convertible currencies, and in few cases, through Non- resident Taka Accounts. Payments for imports may be made to the country of origin of the goods or to any other country (with the exception of those countries from which importation is prohibited); they may be made (1) in taka for credit to a nonresident bank account in Bangladesh of the country concerned; (2) in the currency of the country concerned; or (3) in any freely convertible currency. Export proceeds must be received in freely 3Bulgaria, People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Poland, Romania, U .S .S .R ., and Yugoslavia. 4The Bangladesh Bank announces exchange rates between the Asian Monetary Unit and the member countries' currencies thrice a month. 85 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BANGLADESH convertible foreign exchange or in taka from a Nonresi- dent Taka Account. All settlements with Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts The accounts of individuals, firms, or companies resident in countries outside Bangladesh are designated Nonresident Accounts. All such accounts are regarded for exchange control purposes as accounts related to the country in which the account holder is a permanent resident.5 Nonresident Accounts may be opened only with the prior approval of the Bangladesh Bank. Specified debits and credits to Nonresident Accounts may be made by authorized dealers without the prior approval of the Bangladesh Bank during the absence of the account holder from Bangladesh. Certain other debits and credits may be made without the prior approval of the Bangladesh Bank but are subject to reporting ex post. Convertible Taka Accounts. All diplomatic missions operating in Bangladesh, their diplomatic officers, home-based members of the mission staffs, international nonprofit humanitarian organizations functioning in Bangladesh and their expatriate employees, foreign contractors and consultants engaged in specific projects, and foreign nationals residing in Bangladesh regardless of their status are allowed to maintain Convertible Taka Accounts. These accounts may be credited freely with the proceeds of inward remittances in convertible foreign exchange and may be debited freely and at any time for local disbursements in taka, as well as for remittances abroad in convertible currencies. Transfers between Convertible Taka Accounts are freely permitted. Foreign missions and embassies may open interest-bearing ac- counts, but the interest earned thereon can be disbursed only in local currency. Wage Earners' Scheme. Under the Wage Earners' Scheme, Bangladesh nationals and persons of Bangla- desh origin who are working abroad are permitted to open Foreign Currency Accounts denominated in pounds sterling or U.S. dollars. These accounts may be credited with (1) remittances in convertible currencies received from abroad through normal banking and postal chan- nels; (2) proceeds of convertible currencies (currency notes, traveler's checks, drafts, etc.) brought into Ban- gladesh by the account holders, provided they were declared to the customs upon arrival in Bangladesh; (3) transfers from other Foreign Currency Accounts opened under the Wage Earners' Scheme; and (4) trans- fers from nonresident foreign currency deposit accounts. The accounts may be debited, without restriction, but subject to reporting to the Bangladesh Bank, for the following purposes: (1) all local disbursements; (2) transfers to other Foreign Currency Accounts opened under the Wage Earners' Scheme; (3) payment for imports of specified goods against letters of credit; (4) payment of bank commissions and other bank 5 The accounts of the United Nations and its agencies are treated as resident accounts. 86 charges connected with the handling of the accounts; and (5) travel expenditures abroad for business or private purposes up to the equivalent of US$200 a year (regard- less of the number of visits annually) for travel by air to Burma, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, up to an overall annual travel allocation of US$1,800 a person and a maximum of US$1,000 a trip for travel to other countries, and up to US$150 a year for overland travel to India. Nonresident Foreign Currency Deposit Accounts. Bangladesh nationals and persons of Bangladesh origin may also open Nonresident Foreign Currency Deposit Accounts, denominated in pounds sterling or U .S. dollars. These accounts, which range in term from one month to one year, may be credited, in initial m in imum amounts of US$1,000 or £ stg. 500, with (1) remittances in convertible currencies and (2) transfers from existing Foreign Currency Accounts maintained under the Wage Earners' Scheme. The banks pay interest on balances in these accounts at Eurocurrency deposit rates. The bal- ance, including interest earned, may be transferred in foreign exchange by the account holder to his country of residence or anywhere he chooses; the account holder, if he is not otherwise ineligible under the Wage Earners' Scheme, may also transfer the balance to any Foreign Currency Account maintained under the Wage Earners' Scheme. The balances in the accounts, which are freely convertible into taka at the official rate, must be reported monthly to the Bangladesh Bank and the accounts must be closed within six months or on maturity of the deposit, whichever is later, upon the taking up of permanent residence by the account holder in Bangladesh. Imports and Import Payments Imports are financed either from Bangladesh's own resources or with foreign aid, loans, and barter arrange- ments. Imports other than foodgrains, fertilizers, and items financed by project aid are licensed within the framework of an annual import policy (import budget). Under the Import Policy Order for the fiscal year 1984/85 (July to June), items that may be imported were classified into three broad categories: (1) goods imported by "commercial importers"; (2) items that are exclu- sively importable under the Wage Earners' Scheme, or the Export Performance Licensing Scheme; and (3) in- dustrial raw and packing materials imported by different industrial sectors. The Import Policy Order prohibits or restricts imports of some raw materials or inputs, certain textiles, factory rejects, goods of substandard quality, used items, and materials inimical to public order or religious beliefs. With the exception of imports by government depart- ments, letter of credit authorization forms are required of all registered importers for all imports. For imports under the Wage Earners' Scheme, an importer is required to have a valid import registration certificate either as a commercial importer or individual consumer or under the Wage Earners' Scheme. These documents ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution are issued by a licensing office of the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports. Single country licenses or letter of credit authorization forms are issued for imports under bilateral trade or payments agreements and for imports under aid programs. Letter of credit authorization forms are valid worldwide, except that imports from Israel and South Africa and imports transported on the flag vessels of Taiwan,! Israel, and South Africa are prohibited. For shipment of imports under cash and the Export Perfor- mance Licensing Scheme, the validity of letter of credit authorization forms is as follows: ( 1 ) 11 months from the date of registration of a letter of credit authorization form for commercial items and industrial raw and packing materials; and (2) 17 months from the date of registration of letter of credit authorization form for the importation of capital machinery and spare parts. If these documents lapse for reasons beyond the control of the importer they may be revalidated by the licensing authority. Autho- rized dealers may, subsequent to the month of registra- tion of the above documents, allow remittances within a period of 12 months for the importation of commercial items and industrial raw materials and packing materials and up to 18 months for the importation of capital machinery and spare parts. If the importers require further time to make remittances, then authorized dealers may allow such remittances only under the Wage Earners' Scheme or, if applicable, against the surrender of licenses issued under the Export Performance Licens- ing Scheme, whichever the importer chooses. The validity period of licenses and letter of credit authoriza- tion forms issued for imports under aid, loans, and barter is announced from time to time. Payment against imports is generally permissible only under cover of irrevocable letters of credit. Under the Wage Earners' Scheme a provision exists for the importation of a large number of items against letters of credit opened on a deferred payment basis. The same provision is also available for the importation of all raw materials, spare parts, and consumer goods against letter of credit authorization forms issued against the cash foreign exchange resources of the country or under the Export Performance Licensing Scheme. The deferred payment period is usually up to a maximum of 120 days, except for recognized organizations under the special- ized hosiery un it in the textile industry and ready-made garment companies engaged in export and operating under a bonded warehouse system in which the deferred payment period may be up to 180 days. The opening of import letters of credit is subject to margin requirements ranging from a minimum of 5 percent to a maximum of 25 percent for industrial and commercial imports by the private sector. Imports of books and periodicals up to specified limits are permissible on a consignment basis. Public sector importers, however, may import on a cash- against-documents basis. tSee Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part Two, page 54. BANGLADESH Imports of specified raw materials and packing mate- rials by industrial consumers is, subject to the availabil- ity of funds, governed by an entitlement system, based on the requirements for various industries during each import program period as established by the Director- General of Industries. Firms in the industrial sector are given an entitlement for importation of specified raw materials and packing materials, and licenses are issued on the basis of the entitlement. The entitlement system does not apply, however, to raw materials and packing materials that are imported under either the Wage Earners' Scheme or the Export Performance Licensing Scheme. Separately, industrial consumers may be granted import licenses for parts and accessories of machinery. Goods imported against licenses issued to industrial consumers must be used in the industry concerned and must not be sold or transferred without prior approval. Under the Export Performance Licensing Scheme all registered exporters (other than those of ju te, ju te goods excluding carpets, and loose tea) are entitled to apply to the Bangladesh Bank for issuance of Import Entitlement Certificates. These certificates, which are freely negoti- able and have a validity period of three months, may be converted into letter of credit authorization forms for the importation of goods eligible under the system. The entitlements are 100 percent, 80 percent and 60 percent of the f.o.b. value of exports, depending on the domestic value added in the export product. Any new product entering the export market will automatically be granted a 40 percent entitlement rate pending determination of the actual percentage of entitlement. Foreign exchange for licensed imports is provided automatically by authorized dealers when payments are due. Advance payments for imports require approval by the Bangladesh Bank, which normally is given only for specialized or capital goods. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles connected with authorized trade transactions generally are not restricted. Payments for most other invisibles require prior approval and are restricted. Applications for foreign exchange for busi- ness travel, medical treatment, and education abroad are considered on an individual basis; as a rule, business travel exporters with export earnings of Tk 2.5 million or more during the preceding year are entitled to 1 percent of the f .o .b. value of their exports, subject to a maximum of US$10,000 a year; those with export earnings of less than Tk 2.5 million ( i .e ., newcomers) during the preceding year are entitled to an allowance of US$80 a day for a maximum of 30 days a year; for medical treatment the amount granted is US$1,000 at the official rate, and up to actual requirement under the Wage Earners' Scheme, subject to the consent of the Bangladesh Bank. A Bangladesh national proceeding abroad by air is allowed to purchase foreign exchange from a Foreign Currency Account under the Wage Earners' Scheme, subject to certain limits (see section on 87 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BANGLADESH Nonresident Accounts, above). Foreign nationals work- ing in Bangladesh must obtain approval before making remittances abroad for family maintenance; such ap- proval is usually granted for up to 50 percent of wages or salaries, subject to a maximum of £ stg. 200 a month (net of tax) for nationals of countries other than India, and up to Tk 1,500 for Indian nationals, if the terms of employment have been approved by the Government. Nonresident travelers may take out the foreign cur- rency and traveler's checks they declared on entry less the amount sold to authorized dealers or money chan- gers; they may also, without obtaining the approval of the Bangladesh Bank, reconvert taka notes up to Tk 1,000 into convertible foreign currencies at the time of their exit. Resident travelers may take out foreign currency and traveler's checks up to the amount of any travel allocation they have been granted. Bangladesh nationals may take out Tk 100 in domestic currency; otherwise, the export of Bangladesh currency notes and coin is prohibited. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Israel and South Africa and exports transported on the flag vessels of Taiwant are pro- hibited. The proceeds from exports must be received within four months of shipment. Exports of jute and jute goods must be registered with the Bangladesh Jute Export Corporation. Proceeds from Invisibles All proceeds from invisibles must be surrendered, but Bangladesh nationals working abroad may retain their earnings in Foreign Currency Accounts or in Nonresi- dent Foreign Currency Deposit Accounts. All Bangla- desh nationals who are resident in Bangladesh must surrender any foreign exchange coming into their posses- sion, whether held in Bangladesh or abroad, to an authorized dealer within one month of the date of acquisition. Foreign nationals residing in Bangladesh continuously for more than six months are required to surrender any foreign exchange representing their earn- ings abroad in respect of business conducted in Bangla- desh or services rendered, within one month of the date of acquisition. The import of Bangladesh currency notes and coin exceeding Tk 100 is prohibited. Foreign currency traveler's checks and foreign currency notes may be brought in by nonresident travelers without limit, provided that the total amount brought in is declared to the customs authorities upon arrival. Foreign currency notes may be brought in without limit by any person, provided that the total amount brought in is declared upon arrival. No declaration is required for import of foreign exchange not exceeding US$1,000 by nonresi- dents or US$750 by residents. tSee Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part Two, page 54. 88 Capital All outward transfers of capital require approval; such approval is not normally granted in respect of resident- owned capital. Inward capital transfers also require approval. Movable and immovable assets, including foreign exchange, owned in any country other than Bangladesh have to be declared to the Bangladesh Bank by resident Bangladeshis. There is no restriction on the importation of securities into Bangladesh, but the trans- fer of securities in favor of a person resident outside Bangladesh requires approval. This requirement applies to all Bangladesh securities, whether held by residents or not, and to all foreign securities held by residents. Authorized dealers may obtain short-term loans and overdrafts from overseas branches and correspondents for a period not exceeding seven days at a time. Borrowing abroad by resident nonbank firms of Bangla- desh origin requires approval. Borrowing by nonresi- dent-owned or nonresident-controlled enterprises from commercial banks in Bangladesh beyond specified ceil- ings, as well as any borrowing from abroad, requires approval, and loans by authorized dealers in local currency against overseas guarantees or collateral out- side Bangladesh also require approval. Authorized deal- ers may, however, approve loans, overdrafts, or credit facilities against goods intended for export from Bangla- desh to companies controlled by persons resident outside Bangladesh. Authorized dealers must obtain approval before making any loans in foreign currencies to resi- dents or nonresidents, whether secured or unsecured. They are not normally permitted to hold short-term foreign assets other than small working balances. The permission of the Bangladesh Bank is required for nonresidents other than banks to establish or continue a business in Bangladesh. Foreign private investment is governed by the Foreign Private Investment (Promotion and Protection) Act of 1980 and is permitted in collab- oration with both the Government and private entrepre- neurs. The Act provides, inter alia, for protection and equitable treatment of foreign private investment, indemnification, protection against expropriation and nationalization, and guarantee for repatriation of invest- ment. In the private sector, however, foreign partici- pation is limited to those industries where technical know-how is not locally available, where the technology involved is very complicated, or where capital outlay is high, and to industries that are either based on local raw materials or that are wholly export oriented. For a new investment, foreign investors generally are required to provide as equity capital the entire amount of the project's foreign exchange component. There is no ceiling on private investment, but investment above Tk 100 million needs special approval. Tax holidays are granted for periods of up to nine years, depending on location. All foreign investments require approval by the Investment Board.

Gold The import and export of gold or silver in any form are prohibited without special permission, which is not normally granted. There are no restrictions on the internal sale, purchase, or possession of gold or silver ornaments (including coin) and jewelry, but there is a prohibition on the holding of gold and silver in any other form except by licensed industrialists or dentists. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement March 25. The Bangladesh Bank initiated a practice of forward sales of the currencies of member countries of the Asian Clearing Union. July 7. It was announced that the exchange rate for transactions under the Wage Earners' Scheme, which had previously been negotiated freely among transactors, would henceforth be established by a committee of authorized dealers set up by the Bangladesh Bank. In addition, authorized dealers were allowed to buy Wage Earners' Funds from wage earners, their beneficiaries, and the nominees of foreign currency accounts. Prescription of Currency March 28. Payments for imports from India under the Wage Earners' Scheme were allowed to be made outside the framework of the Asian Clearing Union.

Not for Redistribution BARBADOS (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Barbados is the Barbados Dollar, which is pegged to the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, at BDS$2 = US$1. On December 31, 1984 the official buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were BDS$1.9975 and BDS$2.0350, respectively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates for the Canadian dollar, the deutsche mark, and the pound sterling are also officially quoted. These rates include commission charges of 0.1875 percent buying and 1.8125 percent selling. On December 31, 1984 the buying and selling rates of the Central Bank of Barbados for the Canadian dollar were BDS$1.5116 and BDS$1.5140, respec- tively, per Can$l; those for the deutsche mark were BDS$0.6350 and BDS$0.6478, respectively, per DM 1; and those for sterling were BDS$2.3226 and BDS$2.3692, respectively, per £ stg. 1. Under clearing arrangements with regional monetary authorities, the Central Bank sells currencies of the Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM) countries1 at fixed rates (including a commission of 0.125 percent) but purchases only East Caribbean and Trinidad and Tobago dollar notes. The rate applied mutually for the purchase of currency notes is the parity rate between each pair of currencies determined on the basis of the U .S. dollar rate. The Central Bank regulates the com- mission that may be charged by the commercial banks in dealings with their customers in CARICOM currencies. Purchases of foreign exchange for private sector remit- tances abroad (except for remittances for payment of imports, travel allowances, education, and nontrade payments up to BDS$500 and certain other specified items) are subject to a levy collected in the approval process by the Central Bank at the rate of 1 percent of the value of the transaction. Administration of Control Exchange control applies to all countries and is administered by the Central Bank. The Central Bank delegates to authorized dealers the authority to approve normal import payments and the allocation of foreign exchange for certain other current payments and for cash gifts. The exchange control system provides that foreign exchange should normally be surrendered to an autho- rized dealer. The normal exchange control directives do not apply to transactions between residents and persons resident in South Africa. Trade controls are administered by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Consumer Affairs. !The CARICOM countries are Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Chris- topher and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. 90 Prescription of Currency Settlements with residents of countries outside the CARICOM area other than South Africa may be made in any foreign currency,2 or through an External Account in Barbados dollars. Settlements with residents of CARICOM countries must be made either through External Accounts (in Barbados dollars) or in the currency of the CARICOM country concerned, except that commercial banks may issue CARICOM traveler's checks denominated in Trinidad and Tobago dollars to Barbadian residents traveling to other CARICOM countries, within the ap- proved limits for travel allowances. Nonresident Accounts With the permission of the Central Bank, authorized dealers may maintain in foreign currencies Foreign Currency Accounts in the names of residents of Bar- bados and of other countries. Approval for opening these accounts is given on the basis of the anticipated frequency of receipts and payments in foreign currency. Certain receipts and payments may be credited and debited to Foreign Currency Accounts, under the condi- tions of approval established at the time the account was opened. Other credits and debits require individual approval. External Accounts may be opened for nonresidents by authorized dealers without reference to the Central Bank. These accounts are maintained in Barbados dollars. They may be credited with proceeds from the sale of foreign currencies, with transfers from other External Accounts, with bank interest (payable on External Accounts or Blocked Accounts), and with payments by residents for which general or specific permission has been given by the Central Bank. They may be debited for payments to residents of Barbados, for the cost of foreign exchange required for travel or business purposes, and for any other payments covered by delegated authority to autho- rized dealers. Other debits and any overdrafts require individual approval. The Exchange Control Act of 1967 (as amended) empowers the Central Bank to require certain payments in favor of nonresidents that are ineligible for transfer to be credited to Blocked Accounts. Balances in Blocked Accounts may not be withdrawn without approval, other than for the purchase of approved securities. Imports and Import Payments All imports from South Africa are prohibited, and certain imports originating in non-CARicOM countries require individual licenses. The use of import licensing requirements and quantitative restrictions are the chief tools of Barbadian external commercial policy, since 2 Foreign currencies comprise all currencies other than the Barbados dollar. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution tariff policy is pre-empted by the CARICOM. The list of products subject to licensing is extensive. However, not all goods that are subject to import licensing are subject to quantitative restriction. Some items on the import licensing list may be freely imported throughout the year, while some others are subject to temporary restriction (particularly agricultural products, which tend to be subject to seasonal restriction). Certain imports are prohibited; these include various foodstuffs, blue jeans, and beer not produced within the CARICOM area. There is also a "Negative List" for certain garments, the importa- tion of which is totally prohibited if the product is below a minimum c . i .f. value. Individual licenses are also required for imports of commodities that are subject to the provisions of the Oils and Fats Agreement between the Governments of Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago, whether the goods are being imported from CARICOM countries or from elsewhere. Special licensing arrangements have been made for the regulation of trade between Barbados and other CARICOM countries in 22 agricultural commodities. Payments for authorized imports are permitted upon application and submission of documentary evidence (invoices and customs warrants) to authorized dealers; payments for imports of crude oil and derivatives are subject to the prior approval of the Central Bank. Advance payments for imports require prior approval by the Central Bank. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles require exchange control approval. Except for transactions involving residents of South Africa, payments for all commercial transactions are permitted freely when the application is supported by appropriate documentary evidence. Authority has been delegated to authorized dealers to provide basic alloca- tions of foreign exchange for certain payments of a personal nature and for sundry payments. These include foreign travel (for which up to BDS$1,500 a person a calendar year may be allocated for private travel within or outside the CARICOM area, and BDS$200 a day, up to BDS$4,000 a person a calendar year, for business travel within the CARICOM area, and BDS$6,000 outside the CARICOM area), expenses of education abroad (BDS$5,000 a person a year), remittances of cash gifts not exceeding BDS$100 a donor a year, subscriptions to newspapers and magazines, income tax refunds, official payments, and life insurance premiums. Applications for additional amounts or for purposes for which there is no basic allocation are approved by the authorities, provided that no unauthorized transfer of capital appears to be involved. The cost of transportation to any destination may be settled in domestic currency and is not deducted from the travel allocation. Residents traveling to any destination outside Bar- bados may take out foreign currency notes and coin up to the value of BDS$500 and Barbados notes up to BDS$200. Nonresident visitors are not permitted to take BARBADOS out any Barbados currency but may freely export any foreign currency they had previously brought in. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to South Africa are prohibited. Specific licenses are required for the export of certain goods to any country; these include rice, cane sugar, rum, molasses, and certain other food products, sewing machines, portland cement, and petroleum products. All other goods may be exported without license. The collection of export proceeds is supervised by the Central Bank to ensure that proceeds in foreign currencies are surrendered within six months from the date of ship- ment. Exports of sugar to the United Kingdom and the United States are subject to bilateral export quotas, as are exports of rum to the European Community. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign currency proceeds from invisibles must be sold to an authorized dealer. Travelers to Barbados may bring in freely notes and coin denominated in Barbados dollars or in any foreign currency. Residents are required to sell their holdings of foreign currencies to an autho- rized dealer upon return to Barbados. Capital All outward capital transfers, including direct invest- ments by residents and the purchase by residents of foreign currency securities and of real estate situated abroad, require exchange control approval. Certificates of title to foreign currency securities held by residents must be lodged with an authorized depository in Bar- bados, and earnings on these securities must be repatri- ated and surrendered to an authorized dealer. Personal capital transfers, such as inheritances due to nonresidents, require exchange control approval. Trans- fers in respect of inheritances are restricted to BDS$20,000 annually for each nonresident beneficiary. Dowries in the form of settlements and cash gifts may be transferred to nonresidents with exchange control ap- proval, normally up to BDSS500 a donor a year. Emigrating Barbadian nationals are granted settling-in allowances from their declared assets at the rate of BDS$20,000 a family unit a year. The Central Bank also considers applications from foreign nationals who have resided in Barbados and are proceeding to take up permanent residence abroad, provided that they declare their assets held in Barbados. Direct investment by nonresidents may be made with exchange control approval. The remittance of earnings on, and liquidation proceeds from, such investment is permitted, subject to the submission of documentary evidence as to the validity of the remittance, the discharge of any liabilities related to the investment, and the registration of the original investment with the Central Bank. The issuance and transfer to nonresidents of securities registered in Barbados require exchange control ap- proval, which is freely given on condition that an 91 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BARBADOS adequate amount of foreign currency is brought in for their purchase. Proceeds from the realization of these securities may be remitted when it is established that the original investment was financed from foreign currency sources. Nonresidents may acquire real estate in Bar- bados for private purposes with funds from foreign currency sources; local currency financing is not ordinar- ily permitted. Proceeds from the realization of such investments equivalent to the amount of foreign currency brought in may be repatriated freely. Capital sums realized in excess of this amount may be repatriated freely on the basis of a calculated rate of return on the original foreign investment, as follows: for the last five years at 8 percent a year; for the five years immediately preceding the last five years at 5 percent; and for any period preceding the last ten years at 4 percent. Amounts in excess of the sum so derived are restricted to the remittance of BDS$24,000 a year. The approval of the Central Bank is required for residents to borrow abroad or for nonresidents to borrow in Barbados. Authorized dealers may assume short-term liability positions in foreign currencies for the financing of approved transfers in respect of both trade and nontrade transactions. They may also freely accept deposits from nonresidents. Any borrowing abroad by authorized dealers to finance their domestic operations requires the approval of the Central Bank. Gold Gold coins with face values of BDS$100, BDS$150, and BDS$200 are legal tender and are in limited circulation. Residents who are private persons are permitted to acquire and hold gold coins for numismatic purposes only. Otherwise, any gold acquired in Bar- bados must be surrendered to an authorized dealer unless exchange control approval is obtained for its retention. Residents other than the monetary authorities, authorized dealers, and industrial users are not permitted to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry or coins for numismatic purposes. Imports of gold by residents are permitted for industrial purposes and are subject to customs duties and charges. Licenses to import gold are issued by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Consumer Affairs; no license is required to export gold, but exchange control permission is required to do so. Changes During 1984 Imports and Import Payments January 22. Barbed wire was added to the list of items requiring import licenses. March 12. The Central Bank of Barbados withdrew the authority delegated to authorized dealers to approve payments for imports from Jamaica and, instead, re- quired direct application for such approval to the Central Bank at least 15 working days prior to the contractual value date. April 19. Cement, nails, ball-point stick pens, and flavoring preparations for making beverages were added to the list of items subject to import licensing. May 7. Chain-linked fencing of iron, steel, or wire was added to the list of items subject to import licensing. July 1. The authority for approving payments for imports from Jamaica was redelegated to the authorized dealers. July 19. Structures and parts of structures were added to the list of items subject to import licensing. September 13. Lead alloy grids for electric ac- cumulators and pasted plates for electric accumulators were added to the list of items subject to import licensing. October 4. Oil and air filters for motor vehicles were added to the list of items subject to import licensing. Payments for Invisibles October 1. The Exchange Control (Travellers) Order 1984 was enacted, limiting the amount of foreign currency notes and Barbados dollar notes that a person could lawfu l ly take out of Barbados to the equivalent of BDS$500 and BDS$200, respectively. Gold April 1. The Central Bank of Barbados issued a gold coin with a face value of BDS$100. 92 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BELGIUM AND LUXEMBOURG (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Belgium is the Belgian Franc. The currency of Luxembourg is the Luxembourg Franc, which, in accordance with a Luxembourg decree, is at par with the Belgian franc. Luxembourg is linked to Belgium in a monetary association. Belgium and Lux- embourg participate with Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland, Italy, and the Nether- lands in the exchange rate and intervention mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS). In accordance with this agreement, Belgium and Luxembourg maintain the spot exchange rates between the Belgian franc and the Luxembourg franc and the currencies of the other participants within margins of 2.25 percent (in the case of the Italian lira, 6 percent) above or below the bilateral central rates. The agreement implies that the National Bank of Belgium stands ready to buy or sell the currencies of the other participating states in unlimited amounts at speci- fied intervention rates. On December 31, 1984 these rates were as follows: Specified Intervention Rates Per: Belgian Francs or Luxembourg Francs Upper limit Lower limit 100 Danish kroner 564.1000 539.300 100 French francs 668.0000 638.600 100 deutsche mark 2,048.3500 1,958.500 60.4965 1 Irish pound 63.2810 1,000 Italian lire 33.9700 30.1300 100 Netherlands guilders 1,818.0000 1,738.0000 The participants in the EMS do not maintain exchange rates for other currencies within fixed limits. However, in order to ensure a proper functioning of the system, they intervene in concert to smooth out fluctuations in exchange rates, the intervention currencies being each other's and the U.S. dollar. In Belgium-Luxembourg there are two spot exchange markets, the official (reglemente, or regulated) market and the free market. Most current transactions are settled in the official market; only authorized banks may carry out exchange transactions permitted in that market. Most capital transactions take place in the free market. In a few cases, however, there is freedom of choice as to the exchange market in which conversion is to be effected. Authorized banks may sell on the official market currencies acquired on the free market. In the official market most convertible currencies are dealt. * However, although Zairian currency (the zaire) is 'Currencies dealt in the official market are Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Irish pounds, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Nether- lands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, South African rand, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. The European Currency Unit (ECU) is treated on an equal footing with the other currencies traded in the official market. The Australian dollar and the South African rand are not officially quoted. officially quoted, the Belgian-Luxembourg Economic Union (BLEU) does not permit the use of the zai're in settlements with countries other than Zaire, or the exchange of the zai're for convertible Belgian francs or other convertible currencies. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Nonbank residents may not acquire or surrender convertible currencies in the official spot market until a foreign payment is due. Nonbank residents may make forward purchases and sales of convertible currencies in the official market through authorized banks, provided that any foreign currency purchased is used for the authorized settlement of obligations within 15 working days from delivery (on the delivery date itself if the maturity of the forward contract is less than 15 days); exchange not used within that period must be resold in the official market. Profits resulting from forward contracts not used to cover authorized inward or outward payments through the official market must be surren- dered to the Treasury. On December 28, 1984 the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar in the official market were BF 62.79 and BF 63.01, respectively, per US$1. In the free exchange market, all currencies (including domestic and foreign bank notes) may be bought and sold at freely fluctuating rates. On December 28, 1984 the free market rates between banks for the U.S. dollar were BF 63.07 buy ing and BF 63.17 selling, per US$1. Any resident or nonresident, including banks, may deal in the free market. Forward transactions, whether by banks or nonbanks, are uncontrolled and do not require a permitted underlying transaction. There is normally no intervention in forward exchange in either exchange market. Belgium and Luxembourg formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from February 15, 1961. Exchange Control Territory There is no exchange control between Belgium and Luxembourg; the two countries constitute a single exchange control territory in relation to other countries. Banks in Luxembourg may not accept deposits in Luxembourg francs from nonresidents in Luxembourg or term deposits in excess of Lux F 1 million for 12 months or less from residents in Luxembourg. Administration of Control The ultimate responsibility for the administration of exchange control in the Belgian-Luxembourg Economic Union is exercised by the Belgo-Luxembourg Exchange Institute (IBLC). Exchange control powers for most payments and transfers are delegated to authorized banks. The Belgo-Luxembourg Administrative Commis- sion has authority to license trade transactions; it determines import and export policy, but has delegated 93 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BELGIUM AND LUXEMBOURG the issuance of import and export licenses to the licensing offices of the BLEU, one of which is located in each country. Bank supervision in Belgium is exercised by the Bank Commission, and in Luxembourg by the Luxembourg Monetary Institute. Prescription of Currency The prescription of currency requirements operate mainly to ensure that settlements with foreign co.untries are made through the appropriate exchange market or, where payments in Belgian or Luxembourg francs are involved, through the appropriate category of nonresi- dent account. Foreign countries are divided into two groups: the bilateral countries (comprising Burundi, Rwanda, and Zaire, although the BLEU is not a party to any bilateral payments agreement) and the convertible area (all other countries). All inward and outward transactions are classified in four groups, which may be summarized as follows. List A covers merchandise, transport expenses, industrial expenses (e.g., costs of processing), and other commer- cial expenses, including insurance, administrative ex- penses of sales agencies, and sharing in administrative expenses of central offices by branches and affiliates. List B covers settlements of travel agencies, salaries, pensions, fees, subscriptions, taxes, and public adminis- tration payments. It also includes family support pay- ments by emigrant workers of foreign nationality. List C covers (1) income on securities, loans, etc., rents, and operating profits; and (2) repatriation of certain foreign long-term investments. List D covers gifts, life insurance payments, family maintenance payments, capital invest- ments, liquidation of long-term investments and trans- fers by emigrants of foreign nationality, dealings in gold, transfers by emigrants of Belgian or Luxembourg nation- ality, transfers by immigrants, inheritances, forward covering of merchandise, private travel expenses (except when settled through travel agencies), and all transac- tions not in any of the other three lists. The permissible methods of settlement for foreign payments are as summarized in the table below. In addition to the general methods of settlement described below, individual licenses are granted in order to allow transfers through the official market for some of the transactions mentioned in List D. These cover essentially direct investment by enterprises and some capital transfers by individuals. Conversely, import and export of diamonds, including related costs, may only be paid for in foreign currencies through the free market, or in Belgian or Luxembourg francs by means of nonresi- SUMMARY OF PERMISSIBLE METHODS OF SETTLEMENT FOR FOREIGN PAYMENTS TRANSACTION LIST COUNTRY GROUP FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE MARKET Outward Payments Convertible Convertible NONRESIDENT ACCOUNT IN FRANCS Convertible Convertible or Financial Financial Bilateral* Convertible Convertible Bilateral Convertible Convertible A ,B C D A ,B ,C ,D A ,B C D A ,B C D Any Any Official Official or Free Free Inward Payments Convertible Convertible Other Official Official or Free 1 Free J Convertible Any Free Bilateral Convertible Official Bilateral Convertible Other Official or Free Bilateral Any — — dent Financial Accounts, or in domestic or foreign bank notes. Payments for goods of Egyptian origin (other than rice, raw cotton, and crude petroleum) are subject to special rules. Nonresident Accounts Belgian or Luxembourg franc accounts of nonresi- dents are classified as follows: 1. Convertible Accounts. Balances on these accounts are equivalent to currencies negotiated on the official market, and accounts may be opened freely in the name of any nonresident.2 They are not related to any country or monetary area. They may be used freely for set- tlements with residents, which either must or may be made through the official market and for retransfer abroad through the official market, and they may be credited freely with proceeds from the sale by a nonresident of convertible currencies in the official market to authorized banks in Belgium and Luxem- bourg. Balances on Convertible Accounts may be trans- ferred freely to other Convertible Accounts or be converted into any currency in the official market. Advances on Convertible Accounts other than mail- credit advances are subject to authorization by the IBLC. A minimum debtor interest rate may be prescribed during certain periods for mail-credit advances in Con- vertible Accounts of banks, with the exception of those for developing countries. Convertible Accounts may be held in the form of sight accounts (demand deposits), prior notice accounts, and time deposits. 2. Financial Accounts. These accounts may be opened only for residents in convertible area countries.3 They may be used freely for settlements, which either must or may be made through the free market and for retransfer abroad through the free market, and they may be credited with proceeds from the sale by a nonresident of gold or any currency in the free market. Domestic bank notes and proceeds from the sale in the free market of foreign bank notes, when deposited with authorized banks by foreign travelers in Belgium and Luxembourg or by persons residing abroad, may be credited to Financial Accounts. Transfers between Financial Accounts are free. Balances on these accounts may be used to purchase gold or any currency negotiated in the free market. 3. Bilateral Accounts. These accounts may be opened for residents of bilateral countries and are related to the country of residence of the account holder. They are 2 International organizations and foreign diplomatic representations established in the BLEU maintain Special Accounts, which are equivalent to Convertible Accounts but are not subject to the restrictions applicable to the latter. Foreign employees of these organizations and representations may maintain Special Convertible Accounts which may be credited with their remuneration in Belgian francs, provided they agree in writing not to arbitrage between both exchange markets to cover their current expenses in the BLEU. 3 Foreign diplomats, foreign nationals employed by diplomatic representations accredited in the BLEU and by specified international organizations situated in the BLEU, individuals residing in Burund i, Rwanda, or Zaire, and BLEU nationals residing abroad temporarily for professional reasons are authorized to maintain Assimilated Resident Accounts. BELGIUM AND LUXEMBOURG used for settlements with bilateral countries and may be credited with proceeds from the sale of convertible currencies by a nonresident in the official market. Balances on Bilateral Accounts may be transferred to other Bilateral Accounts related to the same country. Transfers may also be made freely between Bilateral Accounts related to Bu rund i, Rwanda, and Zaire. In practice, the authorities permit the conversion of bal- ances on Bilateral Accounts of the central banks of these three countries into foreign currencies in the official market. Interest, charges, and commissions relating to any nonresident account must be credited or debited either to the account in question or to another of the same category. Imports and Import Payments Individual licenses are required for (1) all imports from Albania, Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, the U .S .S .R ., and Viet Nam ,4 and (2) a number of imports from all other countries outside the BLEU .5 The com- modities for which individual licenses are required include many textile and steel products, certain agricul- tural products and foodstuffs, coal and petroleum prod- ucts, diamonds, and weapons. All other commodities are free of license; the sole requirement is a form completed by the importer giving notification of the payment (payment declaration—model A), which must be pre- sented to an authorized bank. No exchange control documentation is required for imports not exceeding BF 100,000 in value. Many commodities subject to individual licensing are also admitted without quantita- tive restriction. Along with other EC countries, the BLEU applies quotas on a number of textile products from non-EC countries; the BLEU also applies a system of m in imum import prices to foreign steel products. Imports from non-EC countries of most products covered by the Common Agricultural Policy of the EC are subject to import levies, which have replaced all previous barriers to imports; common EC regulations are also applied to imports from non-EC countries of most other agricultural and livestock products. An authorized bank is required to make certain that payment is made by one of the methods laid down in the regulations (see section on Prescription of Currency, above) and that foreign exchange is not acquired until the import payment is due. Exchange control approval is required for payments for imports more than three months before or six months after the date of customs clearance; prior examination of supporting documents by 4Import licenses are issued freely for a large number of commodities when originating in and shipped from Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, German Democratic Repub l ic, Hungary, Poland, Roman ia, and U .S .S .R. 5 Most imports in the latter group do not require an import license when imported from the Netherlands or from other EC countries. 95 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BELGIUM AND LUXEMBOURG the IBLC is required for payments exceeding BF 25 million and for payments made more than 30 days before the date of customs clearance. However, in the latter case, prior examination is not required if payment takes place either under a documentary credit or on a docu- mentary collection basis, provided that documents are submitted to the authorized bank showing that the goods have already been shipped to the BLEU. Payments for transit transactions must be made not later than three months from the date of any advance payment collected from the foreign buyer, and may not be made earlier than three months before the date on which such payment is expected to be received. Payments for Invisibles Payments to convertible area countries for transactions included in Lists A and B must be made through the official exchange market or by crediting Belgian or Luxembourg francs to a Convertible Account. For payments exceeding BF 25 million and in other excep- tional cases, prior examination of supporting documents by the IBLC is required. Payments to convertible area countries for items in List C may be made through either the official market (alternatively, by crediting Belgian or Luxembourg francs to a Convertible Account) or the free market (alternatively, by crediting Belgian or Luxem- bourg francs to a Financial Account, or in foreign or domestic bank notes); payments for items in List D must be made through the free market (alternatively, by crediting Belgian or Luxembourg francs to a Financial Account, or in foreign or domestic bank notes); pay- ments to bilateral countries must be made by crediting Belgian or Luxembourg francs to a Bilateral Account related to the country concerned; payments to Zaire, however, may also be made in zaires through a convert- ible account in Zaire. Foreign and domestic bank notes may be exported freely. Exports and Export Proceeds Individual licenses are required for exports of specified commodities to all countries outside the BLEU, such as weapons, strategic products, and agricul- tural products. Individual licenses are also required for steel products exported to the United States.6 All other exports are free of license; only a form (notice of export—model B) completed by the exporter and giving notification of the export must be presented to an authorized bank. Exchange control documentation is not required for exports of less than BF 100,000 in value. The authorized bank is required to verify that export proceeds are received in accordance with the regulations (see section on Prescription of Currency, above).

A holder of a Regulated Account is required to use holdings in these accounts by priority whenever an authorized payment through the official exchange market is made. The IBLC may order the holder to sell part or all of the holdings in the official exchange market, to abstain temporarily from making new deposits, and to surrender to the Treasury all gains from exchange rate appreciation. Advance collection of export proceeds more than three months before the expected date of exportation requires prior authorization by the IBLC. Proceeds from transit transactions must be collected within three months from the date of payment to the foreign supplier. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts in convertible currencies from invisibles connected with commercial transactions (Lists A and B—see section on Prescription of Currency, above) must be surrendered (i .e ., sold in the official exchange market) within eight days of receipt or, alternatively, be credited to a Regulated Resident Account in Foreign Currency with an authorized bank if they are to be used later for authorized current payments. A holder of a Regulated Account is required to use holdings in these accounts by priority whenever an authorized payment through the official exchange market is made. The IBLC may order the holder to sell part or all of the holdings in the official market, to abstain temporarily from making new deposits, and to surrender to the Treasury all gains from exchange rate appreciation. Receipts in convertible currencies from transactions included in List C may be retained or sold in the official or the free market. Receipts from other transactions (List D) and receipts in all other currencies may be retained or sold in the free market. Proceeds from transactions included in Lists C and D may also be collected in domestic or foreign bank notes. Foreign and domestic bank notes may be imported freely. Capital All capital transactions with convertible area countries may be carried out through the free market, by set- tlement in Belgian or Luxembourg francs through the Financial Account of a nonresident, or in domestic or foreign bank notes. Direct investments by enterprises and some capital transfers by individuals, including gifts, family maintenance payments, remittances by emigrants of Belgian or Luxembourg nationality, and inheritances, may also be made through the official market, subject to individual license. The exchange control authorities may guarantee the repatriation of approved foreign investments made in Belgium and Luxembourg. In that case, capital brought in through the official market (under special license and as an exception ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution to the standard prescription of currency set out above) may be repatriated through that market. Also eligible for outward transfer through the official market are the amortization and redemption proceeds of bonds denominated in Belgian or Luxembourg francs, quoted on a stock exchange in the BLEU, and owned by residents of convertible area countries, provided that such securities have been held at least 18 months prior to the maturity date. All transactions in securities by residents or nonresidents are free, but the financial settle- ment of such transactions must conform to the general regulations for capital transactions. The prior approval of the Ministry of Finance is required for issues of securities on the Belgian capital market by nonresidents; most of the Belgian franc bond issues on the domestic capital market have, in practice, been made by interna- tional organizations, while issues of Eurobonds denomi- nated in Belgian francs are not normally permitted. The Luxembourg Monetary Institute (LMI) regulates the issue of franc-denominated bonds on the Luxem- bourg capital market: for public bond issues, an official calendar is established and priority is given to domestic public sector borrowing and to enterprises utilizing the funds for domestic investment; for private bond issues, no official calendar exists, but the LMI monitors the overall volume and frequency of issues. Public bids by foreign companies or individuals for the purchase or exchange of shares issued by Belgian companies require the prior approval of the Ministry'of Finance. Outward payments for capital transactions with bilateral countries may be made only in Belgian or Luxembourg francs through Bilateral Accounts or, in the case of Zaire, in zai'res; inward payments for capital transactions with bilateral countries may be made in Belgian or Luxem- bourg francs through Bilateral Accounts, in any currency through the free market or, in the case of Zaire, in zaires. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in coins or bars, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of BELGIUM AND LUXEMBOURG gold in these forms by residents and nonresidents are unrestricted and free of license; settlements in respect of gold transactions in coins or bars with convertible area countries may be made only through the free market, through Financial Accounts in Belgian or Luxembourg francs, or in domestic or foreign bank notes. Imports and transactions in monetary gold are subject to a value- added tax in Belgium at a rate of 1 percent. Licenses are required for imports of semiprocessed gold. Imports of gold for industrial, artistic, or medical use may be paid through the official market. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement February 16. Following persistent tension in the foreign exchange market, the National Bank of Belgium raised its discount and advance interest rates by 1 per- cent, to 11 percent and 12 percent, respectively. September 3. The Belgo-Luxembourg Exchange Insti- tute decided to give the ECU equal operational status with the convertible foreign currencies traded at the official exchange market; beginning from this date, the ECU began to be officially quoted on the Brussels exchange market. Imports and Import Payments February 24. Following the conclusion of the seventh session of the Joint Intergovernmental Bulgaro-Belgian Commission for Economic Cooperation, a protocol was signed, aimed at the expansion of trade and industrial, scientific, and technological cooperation between the two countries and establishing the priority subjects and projects in manufacturing and commercial exchanges. May 18. Agreement was reached within the context of Article 115 of the Treaty of Rome for the Benelux countries to suspend through November 30, 1984 the application of EC regulations ("EC treatment") for imports of trousers, shirts, and separated skirts originat- ing in the Philippines. 97 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BELIZE (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Belize is the Belize Dollar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at a rate of BZ$1 = US$0.50. The buying and selling rates for transactions between the Central Bank and the commercial banks are BZ$ 1.9937 and BZ$2.0063 per US$1, respectively. On December 31, 1984 the buying and selling rates in transactions between the banks and members of the public were BZ$ 1.9825 and BZ$2.0175 per US$1, respectively. The Central Bank quotes daily rates for the pound sterling, the Canadian dollar, and a number of currencies of member countries of the Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM).1 A stamp duty of 1.25 percent is levied on all conversions from the Belize dollar to foreign currency. Belize acccepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2 , 3, and 4 of the Fund Agreement on June 14, 1983. Administration of Control The Central Bank is responsible for the administration of exchange control, which is applicable to all countries. Authority covering a wide range of operations is dele- gated to the commercial banks in their capacity as authorized dealers. Only in exceptional cases or in applications involving substantial amounts is reference made directly to the Central Bank. However, all applica- tions for foreign exchange processed by authorized dealers are regularly forwarded to the Central Bank for audit and record keeping. Trade controls are adminis- tered by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Prescription of Currency The only prescription of currency requirement relates to a specified list of currencies2 in which authorized intermediaries are permitted to deal with the public. Payments to a CARICOM member country must be made in the currency of that country. Nonresident Accounts Permission of the Central Bank is needed for banks to open external or foreign currency accounts. The Central Bank may direct also that sums to be credited or paid to foreign residents be credited to a blocked account. Imports and Import Payments Payments for imports require authorization by the Central Bank; in most cases such authorization is delegated to the commercial banks. For reasons of !The CARICOM countries are Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Christopher and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. 2Canadian dollars, pounds sterling, U.S. dollars, and the currencies of the member countries of the CARICOM. 98 health, standardization, and protection of domestic in- dustries, import licenses from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry are required for a number of goods, mostly food and agricultural products, and certain household and construction products; such licenses are liberally administered. There are no quota limits nor other quantitative restrictions for balance of payments reasons. Goods imported into the country are subject to import duties, ad valorem, in many cases, and specific, in others. Imports by the public sector and certain nonprofit entities, imports of an emergency or humanitarian nature, and goods for re-export are exempt from import duties; goods originating from the CARICOM area are also exempt. All imports are subject to a stamp duty of 8 percent of the c . i .f. value. Payments for Invisibles There are no restrictions on payments for invisibles. Authorized dealers have the power to provide foreign exchange for such payments below certain limits. The following limits are applied to purchases of foreign exchange: (a) nonbusiness travel by residents, up to BZ$ 1,500 a person a calendar year; (b) business travel by residents, BZ$200 a day a person, up to BZ$6,000 a year; (c) business or nonbusiness travel by nonresidents, BZ$500 a person a year, except where payment is made from an external account or from proceeds of foreign currency; (d) educational allowance, BZ$500 a course a year (apart from a once-only allowance of BZ$ 1,000 for educational expenses and maintenance); and (e) gifts, BZ$100 a donor. Requests in excess of these amounts are referred to the Central Bank; all bona fide requests are granted. Exports of foreign and domestic bank notes and currency are subject to limits as follows: each traveler may carry domestic bank notes up to BZ$100 and the equivalent of BZ$400 in foreign currency, except that a visitor may take out such notes up to the amount imported. Amounts beyond these limits require approval of the Central Bank, which is liberally granted when justified. Exports and Export Proceeds Export licenses are required for most of the export products. Export proceeds must be surrendered to autho- rized dealers not later than six months after the date of shipment, unless determined otherwise by the Central Bank. A small number of items3 are subject to an ad valorem export duty of 5 percent. Re-exports and transshipments are subject to a 2 percent administrative fee. 3Lobster, shrimp, conch, fish, turtles, mahogany, and wild animals. For sugar, the export duty is 2 percent. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BELIZE Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign currency proceeds from invisibles must be sold to an authorized dealer. Travelers to Belize are free to bring in notes and coins denominated in Belize dollars up to BZ$100 a person, but there are no restrictions on imports of foreign currency. Resident travelers are required to sell their excess holdings of foreign curren- cies to an authorized dealer upon return to Belize. Capital All capital transfers require approval of the Central Bank but control is liberally administered. Gold Residents may not hold gold except by specific authorization from the Central Bank. Gold may neither be imported nor exported without the approval of the Central Bank. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement March 16. A stamp duty of 1.25 percent was imposed on conversion of Belize dollars to foreign currency. Administration of Control December 31. The Ministry of Trade and Industry was redesignated as the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. 99 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BENIN (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Benin is the CFA Franc,1 which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. The official buying and selling rates are CFAF 50 = F 1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market and the fixed rate between the French franc and the CFA franc. They include a bank commission. The BCEAO levies a commission of 0.10 per mill for transfers from countries outside the West African Monetary Union and one of 2.50 per mill for transfers to such countries.2 Banks levy a commission on transfers to all countries outside the West African Monetary Union, part of which must be surrendered to the Treasury. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of those relating to gold and the repatriation of export proceeds, Benin's exchange con- trol measures do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign countries but, for purposes of certain controls relating to the repatriation of export proceeds and to capital flows, the countries specified in this paragraph are also regarded as foreign countries. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Directorate of Currency and Credit in the Ministry of Finance, in conjunction with the Directorate of External Commerce in the Ministry of Commerce. The Ministry of Finance, however, has the main responsibility for drawing up the exchange control regulations, in collaboration with the BCEAO. The BCEAO is authorized to collect, either directly or through banks, financial institutions, the Postal Administration, and notaries public, any informa- tion necessary to compile balance of payments statistics. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be carried out by authorized intermediaries. Import licenses are issued by the Directorate of External Commerce. Exports of diamonds and other precious or semiprecious materials require prior approval in the form of a decree issued by the Council of Ministers. !The CFA franc is issued by the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de 1'Quest (BCEAO) and is the common currency in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Niger, Senegal, and Togo. 2 Transfers between member countries of the Union are subject to a flat commission of CFAF 100 levied on settlements between agencies of the BCEAO. 100 Prescription of Currency Since Benin is linked to the French Treasury through an Operations Account, settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and other countries with such Operations Accounts are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other Operations Account country. Current payments to or from The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are normally made through the West African Clearing House. Settlements with all other countries are usually effected through correspondent banks in France, in any of the currencies of those countries, or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. Certain settlements with the People's Re- public of China, however, are made through special accounts.3 All settlements with South Africa are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. The crediting to nonresident accounts of CFA bank notes, French bank notes, or bank notes issued by any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury is not permitted, except for BCEAO bank notes mailed direct to the BCEAO agency in Cotonou by an authorized bank's foreign correspondent for credit to a Foreign Account in Francs opened by the latter with an authorized bank. Foreign Accounts in Francs may be debited, without prior authorization, with the value of BCEAO bank notes mailed by authorized intermediaries direct to their foreign correspondents. Imports and Import Payments All imports originating in or proceeding from South Africa are prohibited. Certain imports, such as narcotics, are prohibited from all sources. The Societe de 1'Alimen- tation Generate du Benin (AGB) has a monopoly over the importation of sugar, rice, wheat, wheat flour, condensed milk, alcoholic beverages, and tobacco. Certain other agencies have an import monopoly for other specified commodities. Imports of all other goods originating in countries in the French Franc Area may be made freely without an import license. Imports of all other goods originating in EC countries other than France may also be made freely; these goods require a license, which is issued automatically. Certain imports are liberalized when originating in member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Devel- opment (OECD) other than Japan and require only an import certificate made out by the importer himself. Imports of nonliberalized commodities originating in 3There is an inoperative payments agreement with Hungary. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution OECD countries, all imports originating in Japan, and all imports originating in non-OECD countries are subject to licensing; they are admitted in accordance with an annual import program. Under this program, a global quota is established for imports from all countries outside the French Franc Area except EC countries. Certain French textiles processed in foreign countries are licensed separately. All imports originating in foreign countries, when valued at more than CFAF 500,000, must be domiciled with an authorized bank. The import licenses or import certificates entitle importers to purchase the necessary exchange, but not earlier than eight days before shipment if a documentary credit is opened, or on the due date of payment if the commodities have already been imported. Payments for Invisibles Payments to South Africa are prohibited. Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and other countries with such Operations Accounts are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to the approval of the Directorate of External Commerce, but for many types of invisibles the approval authority has been delegated to authorized banks. Authorized banks and the Postal Administration have been em- powered to make payments abroad freely on behalf of residents, up to CFAF 50,000 a transfer. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted. For tourist travel, residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may obtain an exchange allocation of an amount equivalent to CFAF 175,000 a trip for each person (CFAF 87,500 for children under ten) for any number of trips a year; any foreign exchange in excess of the equivalent of CFAF 5,000 remaining after return to Benin must be surrendered. For business travel, there is a special allocation of the equivalent of CFAF 20,000 a day, subject to a maximum of CFAF 400,000 a trip. The transfer of the entire net salary of a foreigner working in Benin is permitted upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher, provided that the transfer takes place within three months of the pay period. Travelers to foreign countries may take out up to a maximum of CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, and bank notes issued by other countries maintain- ing Operations Accounts. Residents traveling to coun- tries of the French Franc Area may take out any amount in BCEAO bank notes, but if proceeding to a country that is not a member of the West African Monetary Union, they must declare to the customs the amount taken out if it exceeds CFAF 150,000. Nonresident travelers may take out any unutilized foreign bank notes and coin up to the amount declared by them on entry, subject to adjustment for amounts BENIN exchanged for CFA francs or obtained by exchange of foreign currency. Nonresident travelers may take out freely the equivalent of CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, or bank notes issued by the countries maintaining Operations Accounts; a maximum amount equivalent to CFAF 25,000 in foreign bank notes; and any amount in other foreign means of payment (traveler's checks, etc.) established abroad and in their name. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. Exports to all foreign countries, including the French Franc Area, must be domiciled with an authorized bank when valued at more than CFAF 500,000. All exports, except gold and diamonds, are free of license but require an export application visaed by the Directorate of External Com- merce. The due date of payment for exports to foreign countries may not be later than 180 days after the arrival of the commodities at their destination; export proceeds must be repatriated by the exporter w i th in 30 days of payment due date. Irrespective of currency of payment, prior authorization is required for the retention, sale, import, or export of raw diamonds and of precious and semiprecious materials. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and countries maintaining Operations Accounts with the French Treasury may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be collected and surrendered. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BCEAO, the Bank of France, or a bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) of countries outside the French Franc Area; residents bringing in foreign bank notes and foreign currency traveler's checks in excess of CFAF 5,000 must declare them to the customs upon entry and sell them to an authorized bank within eight days. Capital Transfers of capital between Benin and South Africa are prohibited. Capital movements between Benin and France (as defined above), Monaco, and countries maintaining Operations Accounts are free of exchange control; most capital transfers to all other countries require prior approval by the Ministry of Finance and are restricted, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. Special controls (additional to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable) are maintained over borrowing abroad, over inward foreign direct investment and all outward investment in foreign coun- tries, and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for 101 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BENIN sale of foreign securities in Benin. Such operations require prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. Exempt from authorization, however, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Beninese Government and (2) shares that are similar to or may be substituted for securities whose issuance or sale in Benin has already been authorized. With the exception of controls over foreign securities, these measures do not apply to France (as defined above), Monaco, member countries of the West African Mone- tary Union, and the Operations Account countries. Special controls are maintained also over imports and exports of gold, over the soliciting of funds for deposit or investment with foreign private persons and foreign firms and institutions, and over publicity aimed at placing funds abroad or at subscribing to real estate and building operations abroad; these special controls also apply to France (as defined above), Monaco, and countries maintaining Operations Accounts. All investments abroad by residents of Benin require prior authorization by the Minister of Finance; at least 75 percent of such investments must be financed from foreign borrowing.4 Foreign direct investments in Be- nin5 must be declared to the Minister before they are made. The Minister may request the postponement of the operations, within a period of two months. The full or partial liquidation of either type of investment also requires declaration. Both the making and the liquidation of investments, whether these are Beninese investments abroad or foreign investments in Benin, must be reported to the Minister and to the BCEAO within 20 days following each operation. Direct investments are defined as investments implying control of a company or enterprise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. Borrowing by residents from nonresidents requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans constituting a direct investment, which are subject to prior declaration, as indicated above; (2) loans taken up by industrial firms to finance operations abroad, by international merchanting and export-import firms (approved by the Minister of Finance) to finance transit trade, or by any type of firm to finance imports and exports; (3) loans contracted by authorized banks; and (4) subject to certain conditions, loans other than those mentioned above, when the total amount outstanding of these loans, including the new borrowing, does not 4 Including those made through foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in Benin and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Benin. 5 Including those made by companies in Benin that are directly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in Benin of foreign companies. 102 exceed CFAF 50 million for any one borrower. The repayment of loans not constituting a direct investment requires the special authorization of the Minister of Finance if the loan itself was subject to such approval, but is exempt if the loan was exempt from special authorization. Lending abroad is subject to prior authori- zation by the Minister of Finance. The Investment Code (Law No. 82-005 of May 20, 1982) provides for preferential status that may be granted to foreign and domestic investments in industry, mining, fisheries, agriculture, and tourism, when such invest- ments are deemed to be of value to national devel- opment. Four preferential regimes are established. Plan A is intended for public and mixed enterprises operating at the national and provincial levels and provides, during a period of up to 5 years, for exemption from import duties and taxes on materials necessary for the produc- tion of the proposed item and from certain other taxation. Plan B, for domestic and foreign private enterprises, is granted for a maximum exemption period of 5 years and provides, in addition to the benefits of Plan A, certain other tax privileges. Plan C is intended for very large enterprises wishing to conclude incorporation agree- ments with Benin, and is granted for a period of up to 10 years. In addition to the benefits of Plan B, Plan C guarantees stability of tax status, free choice of sup- pliers, and certain other advantages. For Plans A, B, and C up to two years for installation time can be added to the period of the agreement. Plan D provides certain benefits for small and medium-size domestic enterprises and cooperatives for up to 5 years. The method of application of the Investment Code is set out in Decree No. 28-254 of July 13, 1983. Gold Prior authorization in the form of a decree issued by the Council of Ministers, acting on the advice of the Minister in Charge of Mines, is required to hold, sell, import, export, or deal in, raw diamonds and precious or semiprecious materials. In practice, residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Benin. Imports and exports of gold from or to any other country require prior authorization by the Minister of Commerce, which is seldom granted. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the Treasury or the BCEAO; (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles); and (3) imports and exports by travelers of gold articles up to a maximum weight to be determined by an Order of the Minister. Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Changes During 1984 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BHUTAN (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Bhutan is the Ngultrum. Since its introduction in 1974 it has been pegged to the Indian rupee, which also circulates in Bhu tan, at a rate of Nu 1 = Re 1. The rates for currencies other than the Indian rupee are determined daily on the basis of the prevailing quotations by the Reserve Bank of India for those currencies. In the absence of large transactions, exchange rates for other currencies may be determined on the basis of the most recent quotations by the Reserve Bank of India. No other exchange rates apply to international transactions, and there are no subsidies or taxes on exchange transactions. On December 31, 1984 the buying and selling rates of the ngultrum for the U .S. dollar were Nu 12.417 and Nu 12.486 per US$1, respectively. Administration of Control The Ministry of Finance controls external transactions and provides foreign exchange for most current and capital transactions. The Royal Monetary Authority is in charge of implementation of the surrender requirements for proceeds from merchandise. of Finance.

Not for Redistribution BOLIVIA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Bolivia is the Bolivian Peso. The official buying rate is $b 8,571 per US$1. Sales of foreign exchange are subject to a central bank handling charge of 0.15 percent, or $b 13, and a National Treasury tax of 4.8 percent, or $b 411. Thus, the Central Bank sells foreign exchange to the public sector as well as to commercial banks and exchange houses at $b 8,995 per US$1. A banking commission of $b 5 is charged for sales to the public, bringing the effective selling rate of authorized commercial banks and exchange houses to $b 9,000 per US$1. In addition, two other exchange rates apply: for airline tickets paid for in local currency ($b 15,300 per US$1) and for the liquidation of mining sector earnings ($b 17,500 per US$1). Banks, exchange houses, hotels, and travel agencies are allowed to purchase foreign exchange at the official rate from sources such as the tourist industry for surrender to the Central Bank during the first hour of the business day following the transaction. Buying and selling rates for certain other currencies1 are also officially quoted, with daily quotations based on the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar in markets abroad. Bolivia formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from June 5, 1967. Administration of Control All receipts and expenditure of foreign exchange are subject to state control. They are regulated by the Ministry of Finance and the Exchange Policy Board which is chaired by a representative of the Ministry of Finance and includes in addition representatives of the Ministry of Planning and Coordination; the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism; the Confederation of Private Entrepreneurs; and the Confederation of Labor Unions. The Exchange Policy Board is responsible for approving or rejecting all applications for the purchase of currency for import purposes, in accordance with the Government's general guidelines, rules, and priorities. The Board also enforces, supervises, and evaluates the mandatory surrender of exchange from all exports of goods and services. The Board is also responsible for the publication, in the official gazette, of the lists of individuals and entities to which foreign exchange has been allocated. All applications for the purchase of foreign exchange for import purposes must be submitted to the Central Bank of Bolivia through the banks. The Secretariat of the Exchange Policy Board then considers applications in accordance with the applicable rules and 'Argentine pesos, Belgian francs, Brazilian cruzeiros, Canadian dollars, Chilean pesos, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Mexican pesos, Netherlands guilders, Peruvian soles, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. 104 forwards them for approval or rejection to the Exchange Policy Board. All public sector institutions must present an annual foreign exchange budget to the Ministry of Finance before applications for the purchase of foreign exchange can be approved by the Board. Exchange allocations approved by the Board are administered by the Central Bank. Prescription of Currency There are no prescription of currency requirements. Settlements are usually made in U .S. dollars or other convertible currencies. Payments between Bolivia and Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela must be made through accounts maintained with each other by the Central Bank of Bolivia and the central bank of the country concerned, within the framework of the multila- teral clearing system of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA). Imports and Import Payments All public sector imports and all private sector imports involving use of official foreign exchange are subject to prior authorization by the Exchange Policy Board. Imports by public sector agencies require in addition authorization by the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Health is authorized to draw up regulations governing the allocation of foreign exchange for the import of medical supplies. Import applications by public sector agencies must be consistent with the official foreign exchange budget. Private sector imports of non- prohibited items financed by importers with their own foreign exchange require authorization by the Exchange Policy Board. Importation of some 600 products, which are considered nonessential or produced domestically, is temporarily prohibited unless such items are covered by the agreements signed between Bolivia and the Latin American Integration Association. All imports in excess of US$5,000 (US$15,000 in the case of mining compa- nies) must be covered by letters of credit drawn on foreign banks. Applicants for import authorization must present photocopies of import documents, such as the invoice, description of the articles purchased, and a clearance from the Bolivian tax administration that the applicant is not in arrears on taxes. Most private sector imports are subject to a customs surcharge of 5 percent ad valorem. Most imports also are subject to a tax on services rendered of 2 percent.

Residents of Bolivian or foreign national- ity must present a certificate of tax settlement (cer- tificado de solvencia tributaria) when leaving the coun- try. The fee for the certificate is $b 500 for air travel to neighboring countries, $b 250 for overland travel to such countries, $b 1,000 for air travel to other Latin American countries, and $b 1,500 for air travel to countries outside Latin America. Outward remittances of profit are gov- erned by the provisions of Decision Nos. 24 and 80 of the Cartagena Agreement. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports are not normally subject to licensing, al- though certain exports may be prohibited or restricted from time to time owing to domestic demand and supply factors. All proceeds from exports of the public and private sectors must be sold to the Central Bank at the official exchange rate within three days of receipt, with the exception of reasonable amounts deducted for foreign exchange expenditures undertaken to effect the export. As regards minerals, COMIBOL and the medium- size mines export their own production, and the Mining Bank that of the small private mines. All exports of goods and services must be effected through documen- tary letters of credit drawn on domestic banks. Proceeds from Invisibles Banks, exchange houses, hotels, and travel agencies are required to surrender during the first hour of the business day following the transaction, and at the buying rate established by the Central Bank, all their foreign exchange purchases from invisible transactions, includ- ing those from tourism. Capital Foreign exchange for outward capital transfers by residents or nonresidents can be purchased from the banks only upon approval by the Central Bank. Inward capital transfers may be made freely, but government receipts of transfers and grants and all proceeds of borrowings from foreign public sector agencies must be surrendered to the Central Bank. All foreign credits, including suppliers' credits, to government agencies and autonomous entities, and credits to the private sector with official guarantees, are subject to prior authoriza- tion by the Ministry of Finance and to control by the Central Bank. All foreign borrowing by the private sector involving use of official foreign exchange for debt servicing requires prior approval by the Exchange Policy Board in cases of individual amounts not exceeding US$100,000, and by the Ministry of Finance for larger amounts. Under Supreme Decree No. 19732 of Aug- ust 11, 1983 financial institutions in Bolivia may make BOLIVIA loans in the form of credits denominated in foreign currency for imports of capital goods and inputs for the external sector with resources from international finan- cial institutions, foreign government agencies, or exter- nal lines of credit. Foreign investments in Bolivia, except those involv- ing petroleum and mining, are governed by the provi- sions of the Investment Law (Decree-Law No. 18751) of December 14, 1981. The law is administered by the National Investment Institute. Investments in petroleum and mining are governed by the General Hydrocarbons Law and the Mining Code. Certain foreign investments are subject to Decision Nos. 24 and 103 of the Cartagena Agreement. Gold Imports and exports of gold and domestic trading in gold are regulated by the Central Bank. The Central Bank also purchases, for its use or for export in the form of gold bars, the total national production of gold. Without affecting these powers of the Central Bank, the Mining Bank may purchase at home and sell abroad, in unworked form, the output of gold, silver, and platinum. The Mining Bank also sells gold, silver, and platinum on the domestic market subject to conditions that it estab- lishes jointly with the Central Bank. The Central Bank is empowered to purchase its full requirements of gold from the Mining Bank. Cooperatives and other produc- ers must sell the gold they produce to the Central Bank. The Mining Bank is authorized to sell a specified quantity of gold annually to domestic jewelers and dentists and is obliged to sell the remainder to the Central Bank. Residents may freely purchase, retain, hold, and sell gold in any form other than bars. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement April 13. The exchange rate of the Bolivian peso was changed from $b 500 (buying) and $b 510.2 (selling) per US$1 to $b 2,000 (buying) and $b 2,039 (selling) per US$1, representing a devaluation of 75 percent on a midpoint basis. A banking commission of $b 1 charged for the sales to the public resulted in an effective selling rate of $b 2,040 (Supreme Decree No. 20170). June 11. The tax on the sale of foreign exchange was increased from 1.8 percent to 4.8 percent of the buying rate of the respective foreign currency. As a conse- quence, the Central Bank's selling rate for the U.S. dollar changed to $b 2,099 per US$1 (or $b 2,100 including the banking commission). The Central Bank's buying rate for the U .S. dollar remained unchanged at $b 2,000 (Resolution 102/84 of the Board of Directors of the Central Bank). August 17. Under newly issued decrees, the unitary exchange rate system for the Bolivian peso was replaced by a system involving five exchange rates. (In the absence of implementing regulations, import aspects of the provisions of the relevant decrees—notably those 105 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BOLIVIA concerning export exchange credit certificates (CER- CEX), gold savings certificates, and U.S. dollar savings certificates—were not put in place in the period before the subsequent change in the exchange arrangement.) Supreme Decree No. 20422 established an "essential" and a "complementary" exchange market. Foreign ex- change was to be allocated for essential imports at preferential rates of $b 2,000 (buying) and $b 2,100 (selling) per US$1. The imports designated as essential were those of which domestic production was considered to be insufficient —including essential mass consumption goods, Pharmaceuticals, construction materials, medical equipment, and educational materials and equipment, as well as imports required for transportation and for the generation and distribution of energy resources, and inputs and capital goods for the export sector. Sales and purchases of foreign exchange other than for essential imports were to take place at ("complementary") rates of $b 5,000 (buying) and $b 5,250 (selling) per US$1. Supreme Decree No. 20421 stated that 100 percent of the foreign exchange value of exports would continue to be subject to surrender to the Central Bank: 30 percent of the net value of receipts from exports of goods and services could be used by the exporter to pay for imports of inputs and capital goods; the remainder were to be settled at the essential exchange rate. A third "parity" exchange rate was to be set on a fortnightly basis by the Ministry of Finance. The difference between the value of exports at the parity rate and at the essential rate was to be remitted to the exporter in the form of CERCEX expressed in Bolivian pesos, which after 90 days could be converted into gold savings certificates. CERCEX could be used in payment of all tax liabilities except departmental royalties. The gold savings certificates, authorized by Supreme Decree No. 20419, were to be expressed in terms of gold but would be sold and redeemed in local currency at the gold price paid by the Mining Bank for the acquisition of domestically mined gold. (Based on the gold price in the London Metal Exchange, this price had been following the U.S. dollar quotations in the parallel market so as to attract domestically mined gold to official channels.) The certificates would have a redemption period of four years, with interest earnings at LIBOR, payable every six months in local currency. They were to be freely negotiable and transferable but could not be used to pay liabilities to the Treasury, departmental royalties, or the public debt. Supreme Decree No. 20419 also authorized the Central Bank to issue negotiable and transferable savings certificates in U.S. dollars for an amount of US$20 mill- ion. These certificates were to be sold initially at a price of $b 5,000 per U.S. dollar (the prevailing buying exchange rate in the "complementary" market), but the rate could be changed by Supreme Decree. Supreme Decree No. 20431 provided that U .S. dollar certificates would be redeemed in U.S. dollars with a maturity of six years and interest at LIBOR, payable every six months in U.S. dollars; the certificates could be freely negotiated but could not be used in settling liabilities to the Treasury or in repayment of public debt. November 20. Ministerial Resolution No. 0296 of the Ministry of Aviation established an adjustment factor of 2.2 over the official exchange rate (in terms of Bolivian pesos per U.S. dollar) to determine the price for all airplane tickets paid for in Bolivian pesos. (The adjust- ment factor was modified to 1.7 on November 23, 1984—see below.) November 23. A single exchange rate for the Bolivian peso of $b 8,571 (buying) and $b 9,000 (selling to the general public) per U.S. dollar replaced the five-tier exchange system introduced on August 17. At the same time, the Central Bank advised the Ministry of Aviation to cancel the adjustment factor introduced on November 20; however, the Ministry of Aviation did not implement the instruction, but instead modified the adjustment factor to 1.7 to account for movements in the parallel exchange market; with the new official exchange rate, the Ministry of Aviation action resulted in an exchange rate of $b 15,300 per U.S. dollar for airplane tickets paid for in Bolivian pesos. December 5. As a result of an agreement between the Government and the Bolivian Confederation of Labor, a special exchange rate of $b 17,500 per U.S. dollar was established to liquidate mining sector earnings. Payments for Invisibles August 17. Permission for residents to buy tickets directly for travel abroad was terminated; instead they were required to use U.S. dollar checks (purchased at the complementary exchange rate) made out to the order of the airline. August 17. Foreign exchange allowances for travel abroad were reduced to US$300 for travel to neighboring countries, US$500 for other Latin American and Carib- bean countries, and US$800 for the rest of the world (previously US$500, US$800, and US$1,500, respec- tively). These amounts could not be cumulated. For medical expenses abroad, the foreign exchange limits were raised from US$1,500 to US$10,000 for treatment not available domestically. Foreign exchange for travel and medical treatment abroad would be sold at the complementary exchange rate. 106 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BOTSWANA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement1 The currency of Botswana is the Botswana Pula, which is pegged to a basket of currencies consisting of equal amounts for the SDR and the South African rand. On December 31, 1984 the official buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, were P 1.5562 and P 1.5601, respectively, per US$1; on the same date, the middle rate for the SDR was P 1.5279 per SDR 1. Exchange rates for certain other currencies2 are quoted on the basis of their rates against the U.S. dollar in international markets. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Exchange control is applicable to transactions with all countries. The Minister of Finance and Development Planning has delegated most of the administration of exchange controls to the Bank of Botswana (the central bank). The latter, in turn, has delegated certain powers to banks appointed as authorized dealers. Prescription of Currency Payments to or from residents of foreign countries must normally be made or received in a foreign currency or through a nonresident-held pula account in Botswana. There are no bilateral payments agreements. Imports and Import Payments Botswana is a member of a customs union with Lesotho, South Africa, and Swaziland, and there are generally no import restrictions on goods moving be- tween the four countries. Import permits are required, however, for most goods imported directly into Bots- wana from outside the customs union. Certain imported goods, including firearms, ammunition, fresh meat, and some agricultural and horticultural products, require permits regardless of the country of supply. There are no restrictions or delays on payments for authorized im- ports. Goods of domestic origin may move freely between Botswana, Malawi, and Zimbabwe by virtue of a customs agreement of 1956, provided they are not intended for re-export. 1On January 9, 1985, the pula was devalued by 15 percent against the currency basket used for determining its exchange rate, and the weight of the South African rand in the basket was increased from 50 percent to 75 percent, with an offsetting decline (to 25 percent) in the weight of the SDR. 2Deutsche mark, pounds sterling, South African rand, and Zim- babwe dollars. Exports and Export Proceeds Certain exports are subject to licensing, mainly for revenue reasons. Proceeds from exports must be re- ceived in a foreign currency or from a nonresident pula account. For a few items, such as precious and semipre- cious stones, permits are required before export is allowed. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments to nonresidents for current transactions, while subject to control, are not restricted. Authority to approve some types of current payments is delegated to commercial banks up to established limits—such as the basic exchange allowance for tourist travel, which is the equivalent of P 3,000 a calendar year for an adult (P 1,000 for a child). The allowance for business travel is P 130 a day, up to a maximum of P 5,000 a calendar year. The annual limit on outward remittances by temporary residents is P 6,000 or 50 percent of eligible salary, whichever is greater. Separately, travelers may freely bring in any amount of domestic bank notes and coin and take out P 75 in such bank notes and coin. The Bank of Botswana may authorize the maintenance of "Retained Accounts" at banks abroad for residents who make frequent foreign payments; these accounts are subject to ceilings. Capital Applications for outward transfers of capital are decided according to their merits but are generally granted favorable consideration. The rulings on applica- tions for inward and outward capital transfers may depend on whether the applicant is temporarily a resident foreign national, a nonresident, or a resident. There is a terminal allowance of P 6,000 for departing temporary residents. Local borrowing by nonresident-controlled companies in Botswana is limited to (a) an initial maximum of P 100,000 without matching nonresident funds, and (b) full matching with inflows of external funds for amounts in excess of P 100,000. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement July 7. The Botswana pula was devalued by 5.07 per- cent vis-a-vis the existing value in terms of its basket of currencies. August 1. The currency weights in the basket for the pula were restructured to restore the weight of the South African rand to 50 percent. 107 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BRAZIL (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Brazil is the Cruzeiro. Since August 1968 Brazil has followed a flexible exchange rate policy under which the exchange rate for the cruzeiro is adjusted at relatively short intervals in terms of its intervention currency, the U.S. dollar. Exchange transactions are carried out by the Central Bank of Brazil, the Banco do Brasil S.A., and by banks and tourist agencies authorized to deal in foreign exchange; the tourist agencies deal only in bank notes and traveler's checks in a "manual market." Uniformity between the rates quoted by the monetary authorities and the effective rates of the authorized banks is ensured by the practice of the monetary authorities of standing ready to purchase exchange from the banks and to sell it to the banks at the official rate for approved transactions. On December 31, 1984 the buying and selling rates quoted by the monetary authorities to the public were Cr$3,168.00 and Cr$3,184.00, respectively, per US$1. The same exchange rates are applicable to "agreement dollars" used for settlements with bilateral agreement countries. Rates for other currencies are based on the U.S. dollar rates in Brazil and the rates for the respective currencies in New York and Europe. With specified exceptions, foreign exchange transactions are subject to brokerage fees, calculated on a sliding scale, which result in effective rates of up to 3/i6 of 1 percent on either side of the rates set by the monetary authorities. On the buying side, other effective rates result from arrangements involving the collection of levies in foreign exchange or at the point of exchange settlement at the banks. Such an export tax was imposed on coffee.l In addition, tax credits are granted on indirect federal and state value-added taxes at a rate of 7 percent2 of f.o.b. value for exports of manufactured goods (certain manu- factured exports to the United States and the European Community are subject to export taxes at rates equal to or larger than the tax credits). On the selling side, a different effective rate arises from the application of a financial transactions tax (imposto sobre operates de credito, cdmbio e seguro, e sobre operates relativas a titulos e valores mobiliarios) of 25 percent to purchases of foreign exchange for imports of goods and services, with specified exemptions. Global daily limits are fixed for the authorized banks' bought and sold positions in foreign exchange. The limits are fixed in relation to the registered capital of each bank: a bank having registered capital of up to Cr$500 million may maintain a bought or sold position 1 On January 2, 1985, this tax was converted from an exchange tax to a trade tax. 2The tax credit was reduced to 5 percent on January 1, 1985 and to 4 percent on February 1, 1985; it was scheduled to be eliminated by end-April 1985. 108 of up to US$750,000; over and above that financial base, a bank is allowed a bought position of US$1.5 million and a sold position of up to US$7.5 million. Banks that are authorized to operate exclusively in the manual market and tourist agencies are permitted to maintain a bought position of up to US$25,000 for each authorized branch, but may not maintain a sold position. The Central Bank supplies foreign exchange to authorized banks in amounts not exceeding those needed to elimi- nate an oversold position, and limited to 90 percent of the exchange sold by the bank concerned to its customers during the same day or on the previous day; included in this limit is their manual market position (bank notes and traveler's checks). The banks are permitted to sell foreign exchange to each other, and transfers between branches of the same bank are allowed, subject to certain conditions; such transactions may be carried out either on a spot basis by cable or on a forward basis, and must be executed within two working days for spot transac- tions or not later than 180 days for forward transactions. Administration of Control The National Monetary Council is responsible for the formulation of overall foreign exchange policy. In accordance with the guidelines established by the Coun- cil, exchange controls, regulations affecting foreign capital, and the management of international reserves are under the jurisdiction of the Central Bank. Limits on international borrowing by the public sector are applied by the Secretariat for Control of State-Owned Enter- prises (SEST) in the Planning Secretariat of the Presidency of the Republic. The National Council of Foreign Trade (CoNCEX), a board headed by the Minister of Finance, formulates foreign trade policy. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is the Council's executive organ for dealing with foreign countries, while the Foreign Trade Department of the Banco do Brasil S.A. (CACEX) implements the Council's decisions within Brazil. CACEX issues export and import certificates (guias de exporta^do or declara^oes de exportagdo and guias de importagao). Coffee exports are regulated by the Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC). The Customs Policy Commission (CPA), established within the Ministry of Finance, is responsible for formulating guidelines for tariff policy. The CPA also decides on changes in customs duties under the provisions of existing legislation. The import policy of the public sector is coordinated by the SEST. Prescription of Currency In principle, prescription of currency is related to the country of origin of imports or the country of final destination of exports, unless otherwise prescribed or authorized. Settlements with bilateral payments agree- ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ment countries3 are made in clearing dollars through the relevant agreement account. Payments between Brazil and Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, the Domini- can Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela must be made through accounts maintained with each other by the Central Bank of Brazil and the other central banks concerned, within the framework of the multilateral clearing system of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA). Settlements with coun- tries with which Brazil has no payments agreements or special payments arrangements are made in U.S. dollars or other freely usable currencies. Imports and Import Payments The import of commodities originating in or shipped from Cuba is prohibited. CACEX has suspended the issuance of import licenses for a substantial number of imports for reasons of security, health, or morals; issuance of licenses is also suspended for a number of items for reasons of industrial policy. The importation of a small number of commodities is prohibited. There is also a limitation on the direct import of consumer goods (and on the purchase on the domestic market of any imported consumer goods) by the public and semipublic sector (direct organs of the Government, autonomous agencies, public enterprises, and companies with mixed public and private participation). All other imports may be grouped into the following two broad categories: (1) imports that are free of any requirement to secure prior administrative documenta- tion, including samples without commercial value and certain educational materials, and (2) imports that require an import certificate, which is issued auto- matically if it conforms to a previously submitted indicative annual import plan; revisions in the annual import plan are permitted automatically upon request for bona fide import payments. Import certificates are issued on an f.o.b. basis. CACEX is authorized to make a processing charge of up to 0.9 percent on the value of import certificates; as a rule, certificates are valid for 60 days, 90 days, or 180 days, depending on the commod- ity. For special bonded warehouse importers, CACEX establishes half-yearly foreign currency quotas and is- sues clearance certificates for certain groups of com- modities. For a number of specified imports, the import certificate may be obtained after the commodity has been landed but before customs clearance. For most imports the prior approval of CACEX is required; these include goods imported by public bodies,4 imports for which tariff concessions are being 3 Bilateral payments agreements are maintained with Bulgaria, the German Democratic Republic, and Poland. Bilateral accounts are also maintained with Hungary and Romania, but settlements are made in third country currencies every 90 days, and interest rates payable on balances are based on the international capital market. 4Under instructions issued by the Economic Development Council, federal ministries and subordinate agencies and public enterprises are required to submit, for approval by the President, an annual investment program incorporating their expected import requirements. In 1984 these imports were limited to US$1,900 million, excluding imports of wheat, oil, and oil products. BRAZIL sought, certain imports without exchange cover, goods for use in fairs and trade exhibitions, certain types of used capital goods, and goods to be brought in with foreign financing on a deferred payment basis. For the last-mentioned category, it is a prior condition for the granting of import certificates for specified groups of commodities that importers must arrange external financing with specified minimum maturities in line with normal financing terms in international markets for the type of commodity and the amount of financing in- volved.5 The specified terms are revised periodically by the Central Bank to ensure that they conform to prevailing conditions in international financial markets. Imports on a cash basis are not approved automatically but CACEX grants exceptions from the specified financ- ing terms for imports for projects aimed at import substitution or export production, imports with payment terms equivalent to those provided by foreign govern- ments and bilateral or multilateral agencies, and imports by small or medium-size firms. All importers must be registered with CACEX, and imports can be effected only by registered firms or persons. Importers are required to submit to CACEX an annual indicative import program as a basis for requesting import licenses; this program is revised automatically upon request for bona fide import payments. The Minister of Finance may, on a temporary basis, and in accordance with the directives of the Economic Development Council (EDC) and without prejudice to commitments under LAI A, authorize CACEX to reject applications for import certificates where (1) imports are for speculative stock building purposes; (2) imports are causing or are threatening to cause serious damage to the national economy for reasons other than those related to the balance of payments; or (3) imports originate in or are shipped from countries that impede Brazilian exports. Goods imported into the Manaus free zone are subject to an annual quota. The transfer to other parts of Brazil (as a passenger's baggage) of foreign goods originally imported into the Manaus free zone is restricted to the equivalent of US$600 free of import taxes. As a general rule, imports may not be cleared through customs before an exchange contract is closed. How- ever, CACEX may approve applications for the payment of imports of any goods at terms of up to 360 days from the date of shipment, provided that no import duty concessions or other tax concessions are involved. External financing at terms in excess of 360 days for imports, regardless of the classification of the importer and the purpose of the merchandise, must be authorized by the Central Bank, which will evaluate them in the light of foreign debt policy. Payment of the amount financed, and the interest thereon, may be made only upon presentation of a certificate of authorization and the related scheme of payments issued by the Department of Foreign Capital Supervision and Registration (FiRCE). 5Certain specified imports, including direct imports by public administrative bodies, are exempt from this requirement. 109 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BRAZIL Prior to shipment of the goods, total payments to suppliers for the nonfinanced amount may not exceed 10 percent of the import value. Spot exchange contracts may be closed if the contract is intended to settle drafts, at sight or on maturity, and the appropriate shipping documents are presented. Spot exchange contracts must be settled on maturity of the draft; settlement may take place 2 working days in advance of the maturity date. Forward contracts, for up to 360 days, may be closed when a letter of credit is being opened. A deposit requirement equivalent to 100 percent of the value of the exchange operation is applied, with some exceptions,6 to the contracting of exchange for the opening of letters of credit. Such deposits must be transferred to the Central Bank as of the working day following the contracting of the exchange operation and are released on the date of settlement or the date of cancellation of the contract. Letters of credit must be opened within 5 working days from the date of the exchange contract. Letters of credit for more than 360 days may be opened without prior closing of an exchange contract. Commercial banks ordinarily require a guarantee deposit for their own protection for forward exchange contracts; the amount of the deposit varies with the credit standing of the customer. When the contracts are liquidated, guarantee deposits may be used in payment for the foreign exchange. Special procedures are applica- ble to certain imports of petroleum and petroleum pro- ducts and of wheat. For petroleum and specified petro- leum by-products, PETROBRAS concludes for each import transaction an individual foreign exchange contract. For some commodities, eligibility for exemption from import duties may be precluded by the existence of satisfactory domestic equivalents (similares Purchasers of foreign exchange for a number of current invisibles are subject to the financial transactions tax (IOF) of 25 percent. Travelers may take out domestic and foreign bank notes freely. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports are free of licensing requirements but require an export certificate (guia de exportaqao or declara$oes de exportafdo) issued by CACEX to ensure compliance with exchange and trade regulations. Some exports are free of controls, but exports of many commodities require prior approval of CACEX, while exports of specified commodities, including certain primary prod- ucts and raw materials required for domestic consump- tion, are prohibited or suspended, and exports of certain other commodities are conditional on prior domestic sales. Exports requiring approval include those effected through bilateral accounts, exports without exchange cover, exports on consignment, re-exports, commodities for which minimum export prices are fixed by CACEX, and exports requiring prior authorization by government agencies. Exports of certain commodities are subject to an annual quota. Exports of coffee are subject to authorization by the IBC. The IBC does not grant an authorization to export coffee unless the sales contract is based on a price that is at least equal to the minimum registration price (in U.S. dollars a pound, f.o.b.) fixed periodically by the IBC for the various types of coffee, although discounts are also authorized. Exporters of coffee are required to surrender, without compensation, a portion of their foreign ex- change proceeds in the form of a contribution quota which varies according to the type of coffee (see, however, footnote 1). The cruzeiro proceeds from the contribution quota are transferred to the Treasury. The contribution quotas also are set periodically by the IBC and are fixed in terms of foreign currency; on Decem- ber 31, 1984 they were US$99.50 for green or decaf- feinated raw-hulled coffee (a bag of 60.5 kilograms) and for green or ground-roasted coffee (a bag of 48 kilo- grams), US$1.26 a pound for spray-dried soluble coffee, and US$1.58 a pound for freeze-dried soluble coffee. Exporters of coffee convert foreign exchange proceeds, after deduction of the contribution quotas, at the official market rate prevailing on the date of the exchange contract. Thus, the proceeds received by coffee export- ers depend on (1) the amount of the contribution quota, (2) the actual price received (f.o.b. Brazil, in U.S. dollars), and (3) the official market rate of exchange. During 1984, the IBC continued to make periodic announcements of minimum registration prices, as well as contribution quotas for exports of soluble coffee and green, ground-roasted, and decaffeinated coffee, al- though not necessarily changing them. The foreign exchange proceeds from all other exports are sold at freely negotiated rates within the limits of the official market. Foreign exchange contracts covering such transactions may be closed either prior to the BRAZIL shipment of goods or within ten working days after shipment. The export of hides of wild animals in any form is suspended. A number of export incentives are in operation, principally for manufactured commodities. Exporters of manufactured goods are eligible for a tax credit on indirect federal and state value-added taxes; on Decem- ber 31, 1984, the credit amounted to 7 percent of the f.o.b. value of exports (see, however, footnote 2). However, for a number of exports to the United States (primarily textiles, leatherwares, footwear, and certain steel products), export taxes of 11-27 percent are levied. For exports of ladies' footwear to all destinations, a tax of 19 percent is levied. In 1984, export taxes at different rates were levied on a number of other products, irrespective of destination. Various financing programs for exporters, some at preferential rates of interest, are provided by the Banco do Brasil S.A. and the commer- cial banks. These financing facilities include both export financing and the financing of production and warehous- ing for export, particularly for manufactures. In addi- tion, assistance is provided to exporters in the field of export credit insurance and by way of guarantees. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange proceeds from current invisibles must be sold through the Banco do Brasil S.A. or the authorized banks at the prevailing market rate. Traveler's checks and foreign bank notes are sold in the manual market. Brazilian enterprises rendering services to tourists (e.g., hotels, restaurants, travel agencies) may receive income tax rebates in proportion to their earnings from tourism, provided that the service is paid for in foreign exchange and that the tourist enterprise converts the exchange into cruzeiros at the official rate.7 Travelers may bring in domestic and foreign currency notes freely. Capital Capital inflows in the form of financial loans under National Monetary Council Resolution No. 63, as amended, or under the provision of the Foreign Invest- ment Law (Law No. 4131) are subject to ceilings and require the prior approval of the Central Bank. The prior approval of the Central Bank is required for borrowing by the private or public sector when the foreign funds originate from official financial institutions abroad, when the transaction is to be guaranteed by the National Treasury or, on its behalf, by any official credit institution, and for other foreign borrowing by the public and semipublic sector (i.e., direct organs of the Govern- ment, autonomous agencies, public enterprises, and companies with mixed public and private participation). Besides, prior approval by the Central Bank is required for borrowing by the private sector when the foreign funds originate from financial institutions abroad.

Not for Redistribution BRAZIL control, although the subsequent utilization of the pro- ceeds for the acquisition of certain domestic assets may be subject to control. There is a separate regime for inward portfolio investment. For the purpose of repatria- tion and the remittance of income, however, inward transfers of foreign capital and the reinvestment of profits on foreign capital must be registered with FIRCE. Foreign capital is defined for this purpose as (1) goods, machinery, and equipment to be used to produce goods or to render services that have entered the country without an initial corresponding expenditure of foreign exchange and (2) financial and monetary resources brought into the country for investment in economic pursuits, provided that, in either case, the owner is a person or firm resident or domiciled abroad or with headquarters abroad. Foreign capital other than capital invested in Brazilian securities is classified, for purposes of registration, as direct investments or loans, whether imported in the form of money or of goods, and it includes reinvested profits from foreign capital. Direct investment is defined as that foreign capital which constitutes part of the corporate capital and participates directly in the risk inherent in an economic undertaking. Foreign capital that is not part of the corporate capital of any enterprise is considered to be a loan. Any loan obtained to purchase capital goods abroad, whether contracted by the manu- facturer himself or by a third party, is considered to be financing (mostly suppliers' credit). Persons domiciled or resident abroad may make portfolio investments in Brazilian commercial and indus- trial securities only indirectly by acquiring shares in a Brazilian "investment company" quoted on Brazilian stock exchanges. Such capital is subject to registration with the Central Bank and must remain in the country for at least three months. The minimum participation in portfolio investment companies by foreign firms or individuals is US$1,000. Portfolio investments are ex- empted from the capital gains tax. For financial imports and for investments made in the form of goods, the registration is in the currency of the country of domicile of the creditor or investor (or of its head office) or, in special circumstances, in the currency of the country of origin of the goods or of the credit. To register loans that are made in foreign currency, it is necessary to certify that the interest rate corresponds to that prevailing in the original market of the loan, that the amortization schedule is not disproportionately heavy in the early stages of repayment, and, in the case of import financing loans, that the prices of the imported goods correspond to the prices of comparable goods in the country of origin. If the terms of financing are approved, CACEX examines the applications for some foreign borrowing in the light of the price of the proposed import. Capital entering Brazil is registered in foreign cur- rency. Reinvestments are defined as profits of companies established in Brazil and accruing to persons or compa- nies resident or domiciled abroad. Such profits must 112 have been reinvested in the same companies that pro- duced them or in another sector of the Brazilian economy. The registration of reinvested profits is made simultaneously in Brazilian currency and in the currency of the country to which the profits could have been remitted. The conversion is calculated at the average exchange rate prevailing between the date on which the profits appeared on the balance sheet of a company and the date of their reinvestment. A progressive supplemen- tary income tax is levied on distributions of profits and dividends to nonresidents in excess of 12 percent of registered capital over a three-year period; the tax is applied whether or not the profits are remitted abroad, but reinvested earnings are exempt. Special regulations govern borrowing abroad. Under National Monetary Council Resolution No. 63, as amended, private commercial, investment, and devel- opment banks and the Banco Nacional de Desenvol- vimento Economico e Social (BNDES) may be autho- rized to take up foreign currency credits abroad for domestic relending for purposes of financing working capital. Safeguards against excessive use of such credits include limitations on the foreign obligations that each bank may assume (related to the terms of the credit and the size of the bank) and the provision that the ultimate borrower must agree to bear the exchange risk. The risk can be mitigated for 90-180 days through monetary correction fixed by the indexed government bonds (ORTNS). The Central Bank assures the availability of cover for the repatriation of the loan at maturity. All other financial loans in foreign currency are effected under the general provisions of the Foreign Investment Law (Law No. 4131). Loans under this law also require prior central bank authorization, but the Central Bank does not undertake to provide specific exchange cover for them. Loans under Resolution No. 63, as well as those under Law No. 4131, must have a minimum term of nine years but no maximum term is set. Foreign loans are subject to mandatory deposit at the Central Bank. In the case of private enterprises, the deposit is applicable to 75 percent of the loan proceeds converted into cruzeiros and it is released as follows: one third after 60 days from the deposit date, another one third after 90 days, and the balance after 120 days; for public enter- prises, the deposit is applicable to 100 percent of the loan proceeds converted into cruzeiros and is released as follows: 20 percent after 150 days from the deposit date, an additional fraction of 40 percent after 180 days, and the balance after 210 days. In addition to these mandatory deposit regulations, on June 23, 1977 the Central Bank authorized voluntary deposits at the Central Bank by financial and nonfinan- cial institutions of the outstanding balances of their foreign loans; these deposits may be released only on the maturity dates for payment of principal, interest, and commissions. For as long as the deposit remains with the Central Bank, the Central Bank covers all costs on these loans, including the exchange cost. As part of the measures announced on September 12, 1984, these ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution provisions were modified as follows: (1) voluntary deposits at the Central Bank in respect of nonfinancial loans (under Law No. 4131) were frozen for an indefi- nite period, except for (a) funds required for interest and amortization payments on the deposited loan funds, (b) transformation of such loans into direct investment, or (c) certain special cases, upon the prior approval of the Central Bank; and (2) 80 percent of the balance of voluntary deposits at the Central Bank in respect of financial loans (under Resolution No. 63), which could be released until December 31, 1984, were frozen for an indefinite period—the balance of 20 percent as well as similar deposits made after this date could be withdrawn within an initial period of 60 days, and subsequently within 180 days from deposit dates; where the funds are for use in the rollover of loans to domestic enterprises, prior notice of 15 days is required. Under a program for the management of external debt, the National Monetary Council imposes quantitative limits on the amount of financial loans for which authorization may be given by the Central Bank. Loans are authorized only if maturities conform with minimum requirements established from time to time by the Central Bank, which permits the total of loans outstand- ing to rise only to the extent that the servicing commit- ments on Brazil's total external indebtedness do not depart from the guidelines set by the National Monetary Council. At the end of 1984 the Central Bank's mini- mum acceptable maturity was nine years. However, provided that the full amount of the foreign exchange remains committed to Brazil for the minimum specified maturity, loans to the final borrower in Brazil, as well as loans to banks under Resolution No. 63, may be made at terms shorter than the final maturity of the debt abroad, and these funds may subsequently be re-lent to the same or a second borrower. Under the provisions of debt- rescheduling agreements, a similar mechanism applies to the foreign exchange equivalent of affected principal repayments originally falling due during 1983-84. Outward capital transfers not mentioned above require authorization by DECAM and FIRCE, which consider applications on their merits. Approved exchange transac- tions involving outward transfers of private capital are effected through authorized banks at the prevailing official market rate. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold coin in Brazil. Gold mining is conducted under Law No. 4425 of October 8, 1964. The domestic negotiation of newly mined gold is subject to a mining tax of 1 percent, which may be offset against other tax liabilities if and when the gold is manufactured. The Central Bank is empowered to buy and sell gold on the domestic market at international prices. In practice, purchases of gold in the domestic market are made at current domestic prices; the international price is consid- ered as a price goal. Imports of gold are subject to the BRAZIL issuance of an import certificate by CACEX; imports of native gold and of gold in the form of powder are free of customs duty. Imports of rough gold fall within the zero range of import duties but are subject to the tax on financial transactions. Exports of gold are subject to approval by the Central Bank, which is always the alternative buyer. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement In continuation of existing practice, the cruzeiro was depreciated on 72 occasions during 1984, for a cumula- tive depreciation of 69.1 percent against the U.S. dollar (in terms of U .S. dollars per unit of local currency). April 4. The exchange tax on cocoa exports was converted to a trade tax. April 4. The financial transactions tax on sales of foreign exchange for imports of beans and cotton and a limited amount of unhusked corn was reduced to zero for a three-month period. April 5. The suspension of the financial transactions tax was continued for an additional period of three months on sales of foreign exchange for imports of cattle hides and leather. May 14. The financial transactions tax was reduced to zero on sales of foreign exchange for imports of refined soyoil. August 1. Norms were established for the application of a zero rate of the financial transactions tax on sales of foreign exchange for imports of beans, eggs, beef, and certain unrefined oils. August 15. The fraction of the cruzeiro designated as the centavo was abolished. August 21. Investment banks were permitted to deal in foreign exchange, provided that they met specified standards. September 12. A schedule was adopted for phasing out the export tax credit. (Under the schedule, the tax credit rate was reduced from 11 percent of the value of eligible exports to 9 percent on November 1, to 7 percent on December 1, and was scheduled to be eliminated by end-April 1985.) September 12. The financial transactions tax was reduced to zero on sales of foreign exchange for imports of crude oil by PETROBRAS, the state oil monopoly. September 17. The financial transactions tax was reduced to zero on sales of foreign exchange for imports of zinc, lead, copper, aluminum, sponge iron, and scrap iron. Administration of Control March 19. The system of comprehensive foreign exchange controls was abolished. Imports and Import Payments April 5. The requirement that import payments should be financed on certain credit terms ranging between three years and eight years was permitted to be waived in cases 113 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BRAZIL involving financing or guarantees by foreign govern- ments, bilateral agencies, or multilateral agencies. September 12. The following changes were made in import regulations: (a) the requirement that CACEX should provide a statement confirming that Brazilian firms were unable to supply a similar product from domestic sources was abolished for imports financed abroad; (b) the National Monetary Council was autho- rized to review periodically the specified minimum financing terms for imports, with a view to ensuring that they were in line with prevailing conditions in interna- tional financial markets. In addition, exemptions from the specified terms were announced for items financed on terms equivalent to those offered by foreign govern- ments, bilateral agencies, or multilateral agencies, for imports for projects aimed at import substitution or ex- port production, and for imports by small and medium- size firms; (c) a revised tariff schedule was adopted, replacing the existing two surcharges of 30 percent and 100 percent on imports with additions of 10-30 percent to the basic tariff rates, thereby lowering substantially the average nominal rate of tariff; and (d) the authority of CACEX to restrict imports for balance of payments reasons was abolished. September 19. The maximum tariff increase permitted to be implemented by the Customs Policy Council was raised from 30 percent to 60 percent, ad valorem. September 20. A total of 2,359 items were removed from the list of items subject to suspension of import licenses, thereby reducing to 2,081 the number of items remaining on the list. October 18. New operating instructions were issued to importers in implementation of the decision to make the annual import programs indicative only. Payments for Invisibles December 13. The limit on sales of foreign exchange for travel abroad was raised to US$1,000 a person 12 years of age or older; and for trips to or initial stopover in Central or South America, the limit was raised to US$500 a person. Exports and Export Proceeds March 13. Export taxes of 27.4 percent were imposed on certain steel exports to the United States. August 21. The administration of export preshipment financing at preferential interest rates that had been handled by the Bank of Brazil was extended to commer- cial banks, and the rate of interest on such credits was increased from 3 percentage points above the rate of inflation to the market interest rate less 10 percentage points; however, a higher subsidy of 15 percentage points was permitted in respect of loans issued during January —July 1984. September 12. A schedule was adopted for phasing out the export tax credit. (Under the schedule, the tax credit rate was reduced from 11 percent of the value of eligible exports to 9 percent on November 1, to 7 percent on December 1, and was scheduled to be eliminated by end-April 1985.) Capital September 12. The timing of release of voluntary deposits at the Central Bank in respect of foreign loan obligations was restricted to the dates of the maturity of payment of principal, interest, and commissions. 114 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BURKINA FASO (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Burkina Faso is the CFA Franc,1 which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. The official buying and selling rates are CFAF 50 = F 1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market and the fixed rate between the French franc and the CFA franc. The BCEAO levies a commission of 0.10 per mill for transfers from countries outside the West African Monetary Union and one of 2.50 per mill for transfers to such countries.2 Banks levy a commission of 2.50 per mill on transfers to all countries outside the West African Monetary Union, part of which must be surrendered to the Treasury. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of measures relating to gold and to the repatriation of export proceeds, Burkina Faso's exchange controls do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Directorate of the Treasury in the Directorate-General of the Treasury and of Public Accounts in the Ministry of Financial Resources. The approval authority in respect of ex- change control (except for imports and exports of gold, forward exchange cover, opening of external accounts in foreign currency, and business travel allocations in excess of CFAF 400,000) has been delegated to the BCEAO and, within limits specified in the exchange control regulations, to authorized intermediaries. The BCEAO also is authorized to collect, either directly or through banks, financial institutions, the Postal Admin- istration, and notaries public, any information necessary to compile balance of payments statistics. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be ef- fected through authorized banks, the Postal Administra- tion, or the BCEAO. Import and export licenses are issued by the Directorate-General of Commerce in the Ministry of Commerce and Supply. Import certificates for liberalized commodities and export attestations are l rThe CFA franc is issued by the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de 1'Quest (BCEAO) and is the common currency in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo. 2 Transfers between member countries of the Union are subject to a flat commission of CFAF 100 levied on settlements between agencies of the BCEAO. made out by the importer or exporter himself and, when settlement takes place with a country outside the French Franc Area, are visaed by the customs administration. Prescription of Currency Since Burkina Faso is an Operations Account country, settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any Operations Account country. Current transactions with The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are normally settled through the West African Clearing House. Cer- tain settlements with the People's Republic of China, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Ghana3 are chan- neled through special accounts. Settlements with all other countries are usually effected either through corre- spondent banks in France, or the country concerned, in any of the currencies of those countries, or in French francs (or in other currencies of the French Franc Area) through Foreign Accounts in Francs. All settlements with South Africa are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. BCEAO bank notes may be credited to Foreign Accounts in Francs when they have been mailed to the BCEAO agency in Ouagadougou by an authorized bank's foreign corre- spondent. Otherwise, the crediting to nonresident ac- counts of BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, or bank notes issued by any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Trea- sury is prohibited. Foreign Accounts in Francs may be debited, without prior authorization, with the value of BCEAO bank notes mailed directly by authorized inter- mediaries to their foreign correspondents. Imports and Import Payments Imports of goods originating in or shipped from any country for commercial purposes and under any customs regulations may be made freely; however, for the purpose of monitoring, prior acquisition of an official import document may be necessary for imports exceed- ing an amount specified by the Minister of Commerce: an import license for products subject to quota and a prior import authorization for all other products. For imports subject to quota, a special commission {Commission des Importations) fixes the quota and allocates them among importers. All other imports may require prior authorization, depending on the circum- stances. Noncommercial imports require a special 3 A bilateral agreement was negotiated with Ghana in 1970 but is inoperative. 115 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BURKINA FASO authorization, to be obtained in advance from the Ministry of Commerce. Imports of goods subject to special controls require the prior approval of the compe- tent ministry. On the other hand, imports of certain products, a list of which is established by decree, may be freed from the import document requirement. The Minister of Commerce may, on the basis of criteria established by his Ministry, waive the prescribed for- malities for imports from countries with which Burkina Faso has concluded a customs union or free trade area agreement. Most imports are subject to a customs stamp tax of 6 percent, an import surcharge of 6 percent, and a statistical duty of 3 percent. All import transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value exceeds CFAF 500,000. Import licenses or import certificates entitle importers to purchase the necessary exchange not earlier than eight days before shipment, if a documentary credit is opened, on the due date for payment, if the commodities have already been im- ported, or at the time of the payment on account, if such a payment has to be made prior to the import. Payments for Invisibles All payments to South Africa are prohibited. Pay- ments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to exchange control approval, which for many invisibles has been delegated to the authorized banks. Authorized banks and the Postal Administration are empowered to make payments up to CFAF 50,000 a transfer to foreign countries on behalf of residents without requiring justifi- cation. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Trans- fers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted. Residents traveling for tourism to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may purchase exchange equivalent to CFAF 175,000 a person a trip (CFAF 87,500 for children under ten years) for any number of trips a year; any foreign exchange in excess of CFAF 5,000 remain- ing after return to Burkina Faso must be surrendered. The basic allocation for travel abroad for business purposes is the equivalent of CFAF 20,000 a day, with a maximum of CFAF 400,000 a trip. Residents traveling to foreign countries may take out up to a maximum of CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, and bank notes of other Operations Account countries. Residents traveling to other countries of the French Franc Area may take out any amount in BCEAO bank notes, but if proceeding to a country that is not a member of the West African Monetary Union, they must declare to the customs the amount taken out if it exceeds CFAF 150,000. Nonresident travelers may freely take out foreign bank notes up to the equivalent of CFAF 175,000 or any larger 116 amount, if declared upon entry or acquired by drawing on a Foreign Account in Francs, or an Account in Foreign Currency, or by exchange of foreign traveler's checks, etc. They may also take out any foreign means of payment other than bank notes acquired in Burkina Faso by debit to a Foreign Account in Francs or an Account in Foreign Currency, subject to submission of documentation. Finally, they may take out freely up to CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, and bank notes of Operations Account countries. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports and re-exports from Burkina Faso may be made freely. However, for the purpose of monitoring, exports or re-exports of certain products may require prior official authorization by the competent services of the Ministry of Commerce, except in the case of certain goods, a list of which is established by decree. In accordance with criteria defined by the Minister of Commerce, exports of certain products may be subject to special regulations. Exports of any product may require prior special authorization from the competent services of the Ministry of Commerce, depending on circum- stances. Exports to Ghana are subject to special regula- tions. Export proceeds must be surrendered within one month of the date on which the payment falls due (the due date stipulated in the commercial contract, which must not, in principle, be later than 180 days after arrival of the goods at their destination). All export transactions relating to foreign countries, including countries in the French Franc Area, must be domiciled with an autho- rized bank when their value exceeds CFAF 500,000, and the exporter must sign a foreign exchange commitment and submit a customs certification. Most exports are subject to a customs stamp tax of 6 percent and a statistical duty of 3 percent. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Ac- count countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be collected and surrendered within two months of the due date. Such proceeds and earnings may not be received in or from South Africa. Resident and nonresi- dent travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BCEAO, the Bank of France, or any bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) of countries outside the French Franc Area. Resident travelers must declare to the customs any foreign means of payment in excess of CFAF 5,000 that they bring in and must surrender these to an authorized bank within eight days after return. Capital All capital movements between Burkina Faso and South Africa are prohibited. Capital movements between ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Burkina Faso and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are free of ex- change control; capital transfers to all other countries require exchange control approval and are restricted, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. Special controls (additional to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable) are maintained over borrowing abroad, over inward direct investment and all outward investment, and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Burkina Faso. Such operations require prior authoriza- tion by the Minister of Financial Resources. Exempt from authorization, however, are operations in connec- tion with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Burkinabe Government and (2) shares that are similar to or may be substituted for securities whose issue, adver- tising, or sale in Burkina Faso has already been autho- rized. With the exception of controls over foreign securities, these measures do not apply to France (as defined above), Monaco, member countries of the West African Monetary Union, and the Operations Account countries. Special controls are maintained also over imports and exports of gold, over the soliciting of funds for deposit with foreign private persons and foreign firms and institutions, and over publicity aimed at placing funds abroad or at subscribing to real estate and building operations abroad; these special controls also apply to France, Monaco, and the Operations Account countries. All the special provisions described in this paragraph apply only to transactions and not to the associated payments or collections. All investments abroad by residents of Burkina Faso require prior authorization by the Minister of Financial Resources4 and unless specifically exempted by the Minister of Financial Resources, 75 percent of such investments must be financed from foreign currency borrowings abroad. Foreign direct investments in Bur- kina Faso5 must be declared to the Minister of Financial Resources before they are made. The Minister has a period of two months from receipt of the declaration during which he may request postponement of the project. The full or partial liquidation of either type of investment also requires prior declaration to the Minis- ter. Both the making and the liquidation of investments, whether these are Burkinabe investments abroad or foreign investments in Burkina Faso, must be reported to the Minister of Financial Resources. Direct investments constitute investments implying control of a company or enterprise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a 4 Including those made through foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in Burkina Faso and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Burkina Faso. 5 Including those made by companies operating in Burkina Faso that are directly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in Burkina Faso of foreign companies. BURKINA FASO stock exchange. Foreign firms operating in Burkina Faso in vital or priority sectors are required to have Burkinabe participation in their capital of at least 51 percent and of at least 35 percent in all other sectors. The sale to residents of Burkina Faso of securities of foreign companies operating in Burkina Faso requires prior authorization by the Minister of Financial Resources who establishes the sale value. Borrowing by residents from nonresidents requires prior authorization by the Minister of Financial Re- sources. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans constituting a direct investment, which are subject to prior declaration, as indicated above; (2) loans taken up by industrial firms to finance transactions abroad, by any type of firm to finance imports into or exports from Burkina Faso, or by international trading houses previously approved by the Minister of Financial Resources to finance international merchanting transactions; (3) loans contracted by autho- rized banks; (4) loans other than those mentioned above, when the total amount outstanding of these loans, including the new borrowing, does not exceed CFAF 100 million for any one borrower, provided that the annual interest rate does not exceed the normal market rate and that the proceeds are immediately surrendered by the sale of foreign currency on the exchange market or debited to a Foreign Account in Francs. The repayment of loans not constituting a direct investment requires the special authorization of the Minister if the loan itself was subject to such approval but is exempt if the loan was exempt from special authorization. Lending abroad is subject only to ex- change control authorization by the BCEAO, acting on behalf of the Minister of Financial Resources. The Investment Code provides preferential treatment for foreign investment in Burkina Faso, except for enterprises whose capital stock belongs entirely to foreigners. Three preferential categories (A, B, and C) are established, in accordance with which special guarantees and tax and customs incentives may be granted for up to 8 years to any enterprise that undertakes to create or considerably expand activities likely to contribute to the country's economic and social devel- opment. Enterprises that the Government deems to be of a priority nature may also be given privileged treatment. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Burkina Faso. Imports and exports of gold from or to any other country require prior authoriza- tion by the Minister of Financial Resources. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the Treasury or the BCEAO; (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles); and (3) imports and exports of gold objects up to a combined weight of 500 grams by travelers.

Not for Redistribution BURMA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Burma is the Burmese Kyat, which is pegged to the SDR at K 8.50847 = SDR 1. Burma applies margins of 2 percent in respect of spot exchange transactions, based on the fixed kyat-SDR rate. The buying and selling rates of the kyat for the deutsche mark, the French franc, the Japanese yen, the pound sterling, the Swiss franc, and the U.S. dollar, quoted by the Myanma Foreign Trade Bank, are determined on the basis of the daily calculations of the value of these currencies against the SDR. On December 31, 1984 the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were K 8.6646 and K 8.8378, respectively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates for the Belgian franc, the Italian lira, and the Netherlands guilder are determined on the basis of appropriate cross rates in the New York market; buying and selling rates for the Hong Kong dollar, the Malaysian ringgit, and the Singapore dollar are deter- mined weekly on the basis of appropriate cross rates in the Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore markets, respectively; and buying and selling rates for other currencies are based on appropriate cross rates in local markets (e.g., Bombay, for the Indian rupee). There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Exchange Control Board, through the Myanma Foreign Trade Bank, in accordance with instructions from the Ministry of Planning and Finance. A Foreign Exchange Control Committee headed by the Minister of Planning and Finance is in charge of the allocation of foreign exchange. Prescription of Currency Burma has no bilateral payments agreements. Certain settlements with Bangladesh are channeled through a nonresident bank account at the Myanma Foreign Trade Bank, and certain settlements with India are channeled through special rupee accounts in that country. Payments to other countries may be made in any foreign currency or by crediting kyats to an External Account in Burma. Receipts must be collected in convertible currencies or to the debit of an External Account in Burma. Nonresident Accounts Foreign exchange accounts may be kept with the Myanma Foreign Trade Bank by international organiza- tions, diplomatic personnel, or other foreign residents, subject to approval by the Exchange Control Board. Such accounts are normally held in deutsche mark, Indian rupees, pounds sterling, or U .S. dollars. They may be credited and debited freely, but no interest is payable on them. Foreign nationals temporarily resident in Burma are entitled to hold foreign exchange utilization cards for use in diplomatic shops. Nonresidents may be authorized to hold external accounts in kyats; all debits and credits to such accounts require prior authorization. Burmese nationals working abroad under permission from the Government may open accounts in U .S. dollars with the Myanma Foreign Trade Bank, Rangoon, out of their savings; with exchange control approval, withdraw- als from such accounts can be used for payment of personal imports and petty expenses. Imports and Import Payments All imports from South Africa are prohibited. Also prohibited are imports of a few commodities from any source—principally opium and other narcotics, mon- keys, playing cards, and gold and silver bullion. An import program is prepared annually as part of the foreign exchange budget drawn up by the Ministry of Planning and Finance. All imports involving use of official foreign exchange are made by the public sector through the Ministries. The Myanma Export-Import Corporation (MEIC) imports goods for the use of the private sector, whose requirements are estimated by the Central Trade Council. In general, state economic enterprises and departments import goods for their own use, including imports under loan and aid agreements, partly in their own names and partly in the name of the MEIC. Licenses are not required. A licensing fee of 5 percent of the c . i . f. value is levied on imports which are meant for resale, but imports for departmental use are exempted. Most imports are purchased on an f .o .b. basis, and shipments are made on vessels owned or chartered by the Burma Five Star Shipping Corporation whenever possible. All payments for imports are made through the Myanma Foreign Trade Bank. State eco- nomic enterprises obtain foreign exchange directly from the Myanma Foreign Trade Bank within the approved foreign exchange budget on endorsement by the respec- tive ministries. Foreign exchange allocations can be transferred by a ministry from one enterprise to another; transfers among ministries require cabinet approval. Imports not involving use of official foreign exchange do not require exchange control approval. Such imports for personal use generally do not require permits, but imports of certain durable items which are imported for personal use, such as cars, require specific permits. Burmese nationals working abroad as well as Burmese seamen are, however, permitted to import one vehicle every year. Seamen and other travelers may bring in a reasonable amount of personal goods when they enter the country. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles outside the public sector are subject to licensing. Since virtually all trade is 119 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BURMA exclusively handled by the state, there is no licensing for payments connected with foreign trade. Payments for most other purposes, including transfers of profits, interest, and dividends, are considered on a case-by-case basis. Payments for membership fees to educational or technical institutions abroad and payments for subscrip- tions to certain foreign periodicals are, as a rule, allowed freely. Family remittances are permitted only for foreign technicians employed under contract by the Govern- ment, the limit being one half of the net salary if the wife is living abroad, and one third of the net salary if the wife is living in Burma. Outward remittances of insurance premium payments other than for the Myanma Insurance Corporation are not permitted. The remittance of pension payments to retired government employees is not per- mitted, irrespective of their citizenship status. Most personal money order remittances to neighboring coun- tries through post offices are not permitted. Foreign exchange allocations for tourist travel by residents have been suspended, except for religious pilgrimage to India. However, residents who have been granted an official permit to travel abroad for any other purpose may take out freely the equivalent of K 100 in the currency of the country of destination or, if that currency is not available, in U .S. dollar notes. Travel for medical reasons is authorized on a case-by-case basis. Travel for educational purposes is authorized only in connection with state scholarships. Otherwise, Burmese nationals are not allowed to travel abroad except on official missions or to take up employment offers abroad. On leaving, nonresident travelers who have stayed in the country for less than six months may take out any foreign currency they still hold and may also reconvert the remaining balance of the kyats obtained by conversion of foreign currency. Those who stay longer than six months must surrender all foreign currency in their possession but may be authorized by the Exchange Control Board to keep foreign currencies in foreign exchange accounts. The export of Burmese currency is prohibited. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. There is also a list of prohibited exports comprising iron and steel, brass, copper, and aluminum and scrap thereof, foreign manufactures, and commodities of domestic origin which need to be conserved for domestic require- ments. In practice, state agencies responsible for produc- tion may export any product in excess of the need for domestic consumption. Special permits are required for exports of antiques. Exports are generally effected by the MEIC, although timber, rubber, ju te, fish and fish products, coffee, hides and skins, minerals, and petro- leum and petroleum products may be exported directly by the respective state economic enterprises. Rice is exported by the Agriculture and Farm Produce Trade Corporation in the name of the MEIC. Export proceeds must be obtained in a manner satisfactory to the exchange control authorities, i .e ., in approved convert- 120 ible currencies or debits from the kyat account of banks in the importing country, and surrendered to the My- anma Foreign Trade Bank within six months from the date of shipment. Certain exports are subsidized through the Export Price Equalization Fund Account. When exports are made on an f .o .b. basis, buyers are free to choose the carrier, but exports on a c . i . f. basis are usually shipped by the Burma Five Star Shipping Corporation or on vessels chartered or nominated by it. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles must be surrendered unless otherwise specified by special permission from the exchange control authorities, which may grant such permission to foreign nationals residing in Burma in connection with official business. Travelers may bring in, subject to declaration, any amount in foreign cur- rency; foreign nationals who intend to stay for more than six months must surrender all foreign exchange in their possession unless special permission is given to the contrary. The import of Burmese currency is prohibited. Burmese nationals working abroad under permission from the Government are required to repatriate a part of their gross earnings in foreign exchange. In the case of Burmese seamen serving abroad, the repatriation re- quirement is 50 percent of basic pay, and it is credited to their bank accounts in kyat equivalent. Burmese nation- als working abroad in international organizations and not subject to income tax are required to repatriate 10 per- cent of their gross earnings in foreign exchange; the kyat equivalent is credited to the accounts of such nationals or their families. Burmese nationals working abroad in private organizations are required to remit as tax 10 per- cent of their gross earnings in foreign exchange through embassies in their country of residence. Capital There is no foreign investment code as such; in principle, investment proposals are considered by an Investment Committee to ascertain whether the proposed enterprise will utilize domestic raw materials, increase domestic employment, conserve foreign exchange, and generally conform to the economic plans of the Govern- ment. However, permission has not been granted for any foreign private investment in Burma since 1963. All outward transfers of capital require prior approval. Residents are not permitted to remit funds abroad for investment. The repatriation of personal assets and the making of family remittances have been suspended, with minor exceptions, for foreign nationals employed in the private sector; those employed in the public sector may remit their personal savings when leaving the service. When the transfer abroad of payments in favor of nonresidents is not permitted, the authorities can allow such payments to be credited to external accounts in kyats. All debits and credits to these accounts require prior permission. Individual licenses are required for the import, export, and transfer of securities involving nonresident interests. ©International Monetary Fund.

Not for Redistribution BURUNDI (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Burundi is the Burundi Franc, which is pegged to the SDR at FBu 122.70 = SDR 1. The official buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar on December 31, 1984 were FBu 124.32 and FBu 125.59, respectively, per US$1. Exchange rates for 19 curren- cies l are quoted by the Bank of the Republic of Burundi (the central bank) on the basis of its fixed rate for the SDR and the transaction value of these currencies in terms of the SDR. Authorized banks must carry out permitted exchange transactions at the buying and selling rates established by the Bank of the Republic of Burundi for currencies quoted by that Bank. An exchange fee of 2 per mill is collected on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Control over foreign exchange transactions and foreign trade is vested in the Bank of the Republic of Burundi; authority to carry out some transactions is delegated to three authorized banks. Prescription of Currency Settlements relating to trade with Rwanda and Zaire in products specified in the commercial agreements be- tween these countries are effected through convertible currency accounts maintained with the central bank and authorized banks of each signatory country. With these exceptions, outgoing payments may be made and re- ceipts may be obtained in any currency quoted by the Bank of the Republic of Burundi. Nonresident Accounts Nonresident Accounts in Burundi francs may be maintained, subject to the approval of the Bank of the Republic of Burundi, by (1) physical persons of foreign nationality, such as diplomats, who are temporarily established in Burundi and are not considered as resi- dents, and (2) juridical persons of foreign nationality with special status, such as foreign embassies and international organizations. These accounts may be credited freely with the proceeds of foreign currencies quoted by the Bank of the Republic of Burundi, and they may be debited freely for withdrawals of Burundi francs for any normal current payments in Burundi and for conversion into foreign exchange (except bank notes). All other debits and credits require the prior approval of the Bank of the Republic of Burundi. These accounts do not bear interest and must not be overdrawn. Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Kenya shillings, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Rwanda francs, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, Tanzania shillings, Uganda shillings, U .S. dollars, and zaires. 122 Certain nonresidents may maintain Nonresident Ac- counts in Foreign Currencies with an authorized bank. The opening of such accounts requires the approval of the Bank of the Republic of Burundi and is restricted to (1) physical persons of foreign nationality who are resident abroad and (2) juridical persons having branches or subsidiaries abroad. These accounts may be credited freely with any foreign currency quoted by the Bank of the Republic of Burundi which is received from abroad. They may be debited freely for (1) conversion into Burundi francs for any payments in Burundi and (2) payments abroad for travel and representation or for the purchase of foreign goods. These accounts cannot bear interest and must not be overdrawn; the related bank charges and commissions may be settled in Burundi francs. Imports and Import Payments All imports originating in or shipped from South Africa are prohibited. All imports require licenses, except trade samples without commercial value and merchandise not intended for sale whose declared con- sumer value c. & f. Bujumbura is FBu 50,000 or less. Authorization to import goods for sale using the import- er's own foreign exchange is subject to prior payment of customs duties in foreign exchange. Such authorization is granted to approved importers in the form of licenses not involving purchase of official foreign exchange. Imports of certain Pharmaceuticals are suspended, namely: conditioned ampicillin, capsules of 250 and 500 milligrams; bactrim in tablets of 400 and 800 milligrams; meprobamate in tablets of 400 milli- grams; and phenobarbital in tablets. Importers have been instructed not to order abroad certain goods of which domestic stocks are adequate or that are produced locally. Applications for licenses must be submitted to the Bank of the Republic of Burundi through an authorized bank. The approval of such an application constitutes an authorization also to obtain foreign exchange. With specified exceptions, authorized banks approve applications for licenses with a value not exceeding FBu 500,000 f .o .b. for transactions involving surface transportation; applications for amounts in ex- cess of FBu 500,000 require the approval of the Bank of the Republic of Burundi. A license is valid for 12 months starting on the first day of the month following its validation, but extensions may be granted by the Bank of the Republic of Burundi. An administrative tax amount- ing to 1 percent of the f .o .b. value of the goods is collected at the time of validation of the license. All goods imported into Burundi must be insured by ap- proved Burundi insurers, and premiums must be paid in Burundi francs. All consignments of imports exceeding FBu 500,000 in value are subject to preshipment inspection with regard to quality, quantity, packaging, ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution and price comparison by the Societe Generate de Surveillance (SGS) of Geneva acting for the Burundi authorities. In principle, foreign exchange is made available at the time of shipment of the goods. For goods under global licenses, foreign exchange is not made available until after customs clearance. All imports are subject to a statistical tax of 4 percent ad valorem, in addition to any applicable customs duties and fiscal duties. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require approval. Shipping insurance on coffee exports normally must be taken out in Burundi francs with a Burundi insurer. Upon presenta- tion of evidence of payment of taxes, foreign nationals residing and working in Burundi are permitted to transfer freely up to 30 percent of their net annual income. The permitted annual transfer is 60 percent of income for experts working for the Government under individual employment contracts containing a transfer clause and receiving remuneration entirely in Burundi francs. Pri- vate joint-stock companies may freely and immediately transfer a portion of the return on foreign capital and of the share allocated to foreign directors, not exceeding 40 percent of the distributed profits for industrial and agricultural enterprises and 30 percent for commercial and service enterprises, net of corporation tax and the tax on capital income. Up to 30 percent of emoluments paid to foreign directors and auditors are transferable if the recipients are residents and up to 100 percent if they are nonresidents. Transfer of the balance of the profits may be authorized subsequently as follows: 50 percent after three years of saving, 60 percent after four years, and 100 percent after five years. Profits awaiting remittance may be invested or saved at the Treasury, public agencies, public authorities or financial institutions that manage savings; and interest earned on such deposits is eligible for transfer. However, these provisions are without prejudice to any larger transfer guarantees granted by the Investment Code to enterprises that have been accorded special preferential status. Persons leaving Burundi permanently are authorized to transfer abroad their holdings of Burundi francs that consist of unremitted savings or the sale proceeds of their personal effects. Transfer of rental income from foreign owners of new commercial, industrial, and office build- ings is permitted up to 50 percent of net rental income (after payment of taxes and deduction of 20 percent for maintenance expenses); the remainder, plus any accrued interest, may be transferred three years later, provided that the funds have been held on deposit with a domestic financial institution. For old buildings and new residen- tial buildings, transfer of 100 percent of rental income is permitted after placement of such income for at least 5 years in investment or savings bonds. Residents may apply for exchange needed for foreign travel. There is no fixed limit on the amount that may be allocated, which depends on the nature of the travel. All travelers may take out up to FBu 2,000 in Burundi bank BURUNDI notes. In addition, residents may freely purchase foreign travel tickets, up to reasonable amounts, against pay- ment in Burundi francs. Nonresidents staying in a hotel or guest house in Burundi must pay their hotel bills by selling foreign currencies quoted by the Bank of the Republic of Burundi or by using a credit card. Payment in Burundi francs is, however, acceptable in the case of guests for whom a resident company or individual has assumed responsibility and in the case of nationals of Zaire or Rwanda who produce declarations of means of payment issued under the auspices of the Economic Community of the Great Lake Countries (CEPGL). Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. All exports valued above FBu 10,000 require a prior declaration in each case, which must be presented for certification by the Bank of the Republic of Burundi through an authorized bank. Declarations are valid for six months, but extensions may be granted by the Bank of the Republic of Burundi. Payments must be collected within 90 days of the date of export declaration at the customs. All exchange proceeds from exports must be surrendered to an authorized bank within 8 days of their collection. Exports of arabica and robusta coffee from the Rumonge region are the monopoly of the Burundi Coffee Com- pany. Virtually all exports, including coffee in some cases, are subject to export taxes and a statistical tax. Exports of manufactured goods may receive a refund of duties paid, provided that they incorporate raw materials on which import duty has been paid. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles must be surrendered to authorized banks. Travelers may bring in any amount of foreign bank notes and up to FBu 2,000 in Burundi bank notes. Capital The Investment Code of August 25, 1967 provides tax and other benefits for domestic and foreign private investors. A new Investment Law, adopted on April 4, 1979, revised some of the investment procedures. Under the Investment Code new investments that fulfill specified conditions as to amount and economic import- ance may be granted priority status to which specified privileges are attached, mainly in the form of exemptions from import duties and from taxes on income from the investment. Import duties and taxes may be reduced or suspended for goods and equipment needed for starting a particular project and, during a period of 5 years, for other merchandise needed for the manufacturing opera- tion or for the upkeep of the original investment. Taxes on profits and real estate may likewise be reduced or suspended. Enterprises accorded priority status may be granted a degree of protection against foreign competi- tion, priority in the allocation of government contracts, and a guarantee from the Bank of the Republic of 123 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BURUNDI Burundi for the free transfer of profits and dividends and the repatriation of the invested capital. In addition to these privileges, companies undertaking investments that are considered to be of prime importance to Burundi's economic development may be granted, under a separate agreement, a guarantee that direct taxes on their activi- ties will not be increased for 15 years. An investment commission under the Planning Secretariat is responsible for examining requests for priority status and granting the necessary authorization. In addition, under the new law, Burundi guarantees each foreign investor the right to move into the country; foreign investors are also assured an allocation of foreign exchange for the pur- chase of raw materials abroad as well as for the repay- ment of loans taken out under the investment agreement. Capital transfers by residents require individual authorization, as does foreign capital on which a repatri- ation guarantee has been granted. The guarantee is furnished for foreign exchange imported by resident enterprises to provide working capital in foreign ex- change; it applies to any of the currencies quoted by the Bank of the Republic of Burundi and is valid for a one- year period and is renewable. The guarantee provides for the transfer of the original amount surrendered at the official rate ruling on the day of transfer. Under the new law, Burundi also guarantees the repatriation of invested capital in the event of sale or shutdown of the business. Gold All physical or juridical persons holding gold mining permits issued by the Ministers responsible for Mining and Customs may open purchasing houses for gold mined by artisans in Burundi. Gold produced by artisans may be sold only to approved houses. Exports of gold must be declared in Burundi francs at the average monthly rates communicated by the Bank of the Re- public of Burundi. Gold exports are authorized jointly by the Mining and Customs Departments. Changes During 1984 Following a review of the system in the context of the country's balance of payments situation, a number of changes in exchange and trade regulations were put in place in Burundi on various occasions during 1984. The tightening of regulations related mainly to imports and import payments and payments for invisibles. 124 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CAMEROON (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Cameroon is the CFA Franc,l which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. Exchange transactions in French francs between the BEAC and commercial banks take place at the rate of CFAF 50 = F 1. Buying and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also officially posted, with quotations based on the fixed rate for the French franc and the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market. A commission of 0.50 percent is levied on transfers to countries that are not members of the BEAC, except transfers in respect of central and local government operations, payments for imports covered by a duly issued license domiciled with a bank, scheduled repay- ments on loans properly obtained abroad, travel allow- ances paid by the Government and its agencies for official missions, and payments of reinsurance pre- miums. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of those relating to gold, Came- roon's exchange control measures generally do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Terri- tories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely, but all financial transfers in excess of CFAF 500,000 to countries of the French Franc Area must be declared to the authorities for statistical purposes. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Directorate of Economic Controls and External Finance in the Ministry of Finance. Exchange transactions relating to all coun- tries must be effected through authorized intermediaries, that is, the Postal Administration and authorized banks. Import licenses are issued by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and export licenses are issued by the Ministry of Finance. Prescription of Currency Since Cameroon is an Operations Account country, settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other Operations Account country. Settlements with all other 1 The CFA franc circulating in Cameroon is issued by the Banque des Etats de I'Afrique Centrale (BEAC) and is legal tender also in the Central African Republic, Chad, the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon. countries are usually made through correspondent banks in France in any of the currencies of those countries or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. All settlements between Cameroon and South Africa are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. BEAC bank notes may be credited to Foreign Accounts in Francs when mailed to the National Directorate of the BEAC in Yaounde by the foreign correspondents of authorized banks. Imports and Import Payments Imports from South Africa are prohibited. The import from all sources of certain "controlled" goods requires a special authorization (autorisation speciale d'importa- tion) y in addition to an import license. All other imports, irrespective of origin, are subject to licensing when valued at CFAF 500,000 or more (CFAF 1 million or more in the case of large retail stores), but licenses are issued freely. All import transactions must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value exceeds CFAF 50,000. Import transactions by residents involving goods for use outside Cameroon must be domiciled with a bank in the country of final destination. Settlements for imports effected under an import license benefit from the authorization of uninterrupted transfer given to the authorized banks by the Ministry of Finance. Payments for Invisibles Payments in excess of CFAF 500,000 for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries require prior declaration but are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to the approval of the Ministry of Finance. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted freely, subject to declaration, when the basic transaction has been approved. For tourist travel, residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may obtain an exchange allocation of an amount equivalent to CFAF 200,000 a person a year; any foreign exchange remaining after return to Came- roon must be surrendered. For business travel, the corresponding allocation is the equivalent of CFAF 15,000 a day, subject to a maximum of CFAF 450,000 a trip. In practice, additional allocations may be allowed. The transfer of rent from real property owned in Cameroon by foreign nationals is limited, in principle, to 50 percent of the income declared for taxation purposes, 125 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CAMEROON net of tax. Remittances for current repair and manage- ment of real property abroad are normally limited to the equivalent of CFAF 200,000 every two or three years. Depending on family status, the transfer of 20 percent or 50 percent of the salary of a foreigner working in Cameroon is permitted upon presentation of the appro- priate pay voucher, provided that the transfer takes place within one month of the pay period concerned. Except in the case of foreigners working in Cameroon temporarily, payments of insurance premiums to foreign countries are not permitted if the same type of insurance is available in Cameroon. Resident and nonresident travelers to coun- tries outside the French Franc Area may take out up to CFAF 20,000 in BEAC bank notes. Travelers to other countries of the French Franc Area may, subject to prior declaration, take out any amount in BEAC bank notes. Nonresident travelers may take out foreign bank notes and coin up to the amount declared by them on entry, or up to CFAF 50,000 if no declaration was made. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. Export transactions valued at CFAF 50,000 or more must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Exports to all countries are subject to domiciliation requirements for the appropriate documents. Proceeds from exports to all countries must be repatriated within 15 days of the payment date stipulated in the sales contract, and proceeds received in currencies, other than those of France or an Operations Account country, must be surrendered within a month after collection. Payments for exports must be made within 30 days from the arrival date of the merchandise at its destination. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Ac- count countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services, and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets, must be collected within a month of the due date and surrendered within a month of collection if received in foreign currency. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BEAC, the Bank of France, or a bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) of countries outside the French Franc Area. Capital Capital movements between Cameroon and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are free of exchange control. Capital transfers to all other countries require exchange control approval and are restricted, but capital receipts from such coun- tries are permitted freely. Emigrants to countries outside 126 the French Franc Area may transfer abroad their full savings, provided that they have met their tax obliga- tions. With the exception of controls over the sale or introduction of foreign securities in Cameroon, the controls on capital movements do not apply to relations with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries. All foreign securities and titles embodying claims on nonresidents must be depos- ited with an authorized intermediary and be classified as foreign, whether they belong to residents or nonresi- dents. Direct investments abroad2 require the prior approval of the Ministry of Finance, unless they take the form of a capital increase resulting from reinvestment of undis- tributed profits; the full or partial liquidation of such investments requires only a report after the fact to the Minister of Finance, unless the operation involves the relinquishing of a participation that had previously been approved as constituting a direct investment abroad. Foreign direct investments in Cameroon3 require prior declaration to the Minister of Finance, unless they take the form of a capital increase resulting from reinvestment of undistributed profits; the Minister has a period of two months from receipt of the declaration during which he may request postponement. The full or partial liquidation of direct investments in Cameroon requires only report- ing to the Minister of Finance, unless the operation involves the relinquishing of a participation that had previously been approved as constituting a direct invest- ment in Cameroon. Both the making and the liquidation of direct investments, whether these are Cameroonian investments abroad or foreign investments in Cameroon, must be reported to the Minister of Finance within 20 days following each operation. Direct investments are defined as investments implying control of a company or enterprise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Cameroon requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance and must subsequently be reported to him. Exempt from authorization, however, and subject only to a report after the fact, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Cameroonian Government and (2) shares similar to securities whose issue, advertising, or offering for sale in Cameroon has already been authorized. Borrowing abroad by physical or juridical persons, whether public or private, whose normal residence or registered office is in Cameroon, or by branches or subsidiaries in Cameroon of juridical persons whose 2 Including those made through foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in Cameroon and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Cameroon. 3 Including those made by companies in Cameroon that are directly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in Cameroon of foreign companies. ©International Monetary Fund.

The following are, however, exempt from this authorization, and require only a report: (1) loans directly connected with the rendering of services abroad by the persons or firms mentioned above, or with the financing of commercial transactions either between Cameroon and countries abroad or be- tween foreign countries, in which these persons or firms take part; and (2) loans contracted by registered banks and credit institutions. Lending abroad by physical and juridical persons, whether public or private, whose normal residence or registered office is in Cameroon, or by branches or subsidiaries in Cameroon of juridical persons whose registered office is abroad, requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance and must subsequently be reported to him. The following are, however, exempt from prior authorization, and require only a report: (1) loans constituting a direct investment abroad for which prior approval has been obtained, as indicated above; (2) loans directly connected with the rendering of services abroad by the persons or firms mentioned above, or with the financing of commercial transactions either between Cameroon and countries abroad or be- tween foreign countries, in which these persons or firms take part; and (3) loans not exceeding CFAF 500,000, provided the maturity does not exceed two years and the rate of interest does not exceed 6 percent a year. A new Investment Code, promulgated on July 4, 1984, established four categories of fiscal benefits that may be granted to both foreign and domestic firms undertaking new projects in the agricultural, livestock, forestry, tourism, construction, public works, mining, and industrial equipment maintenance sectors. The new Investment Code aims to promote sectors considered strategic in the development plan, to generate employ- ment and foreign exchange, and to geographically diversify economic activity. The type and duration of benefits vary according to, inter alia, the size of the investment, the location of the enterprise, the economic activity undertaken, the factor mix, and the production techniques employed. Category A benefits, to last over a period of ten years, apply to promotional enterprises investing over the period no less than CFAF 500 million and satisfying a number of prerequisites. The benefits consist of the reduction (to 5 percent) of taxes and duties on imported goods and their exemption on domestic purchases of equipment, spare parts, and raw materials. CAMEROON Category B benefits, which apply to firms in priority sectors investing no less than CFAF 2.5 billion, include, in addition to those under Category A, a number of other fiscal benefits related to property transfers and amortiza- tions for a period of five years. Category C benefits apply to small and medium-size enterprises with an investment level of CFAF 500 million over a 10-year period. Benefits include exemption from a number of asset and income levies. The duration of the benefits extends to 15 years for firms operating outside the areas of highest industrial concentration. Finally, under cate- gory D, strategic firms investing over CFAF 5 billion in five years may enjoy the same benefits as under category B and are guaranteed the maintenance of the fiscal regime for 15 years. Ordinance No. 73/27 of August 30, 1973 provided that public entities should hold at least one third of the share capital of each banking institution and that the headquarters of each banking institution should be in Cameroon. This ordinance also required banks with foreign majority participation to submit to the monetary authorities information on all their current transactions abroad and to obtain prior approval for any changes in the structure of their equity holdings. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold jewelry in Cameroon. They require the approval of the Directorate of Mines to hold gold in any other form. Such approval is normally given only to industrial users, including jewelers. Newly mined gold must be declared to the Directorate of Mines, which authorizes either its exportation or its sale to domestic industrial users; exports are made only to France. Imports and exports of gold require prior authorization by the Directorate of Mines and the Minister of Finance, which is seldom granted for imports. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, and (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles). Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Changes During 1984 Capital July 4. A new Investment Code was introduced, providing a range of fiscal incentives under four separate regimes. 127 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CANADA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Canada is the Canadian Dollar. The authorities of Canada do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions, and exchange rates are deter- mined on the basis of demand and supply conditions in the exchange market; however, the authorities intervene from time to time to maintain orderly conditions in that market. The principal intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. The closing interbank market rate for the U.S. dollar on December 31, 1984 was Can$1.3217 per US$ 1. Forward exchange rates are similarly determined in the market and it is not the practice of the authorities to intervene. There are no taxes or subsidies on pur- chases or sales of foreign exchange. On March 25, 1952 Canada notified the Fund that it was prepared to accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Prescription of Currency No prescription of currency requirements are in force. Imports and Import Payments Import licenses are required only for certain drugs; a few agricultural items; certain textile products, clothing, and footwear; certain endangered species of fauna and flora; natural gas; and material and equipment for the production or use of atomic energy. For some agricul- tural items, such as certain dairy products, licenses are generally not being issued. Commercial imports of certain commodities from any source are tightly con- trolled or prohibited; the main products affected are oleomargarine and used automobiles. Imports of nonrub- ber footwear are subject to a global quota. Imports of clothing and certain textile products from low-cost sources are subject to bilateral agreements. Imports of automobiles from Japan are restrained by agreement between the two countries. Exports and Export Proceeds The surrender of the proceeds from exports is not required, and exchange receipts are freely disposable. For supply reasons, the export of a few commodities to all destinations is under export control. These include crude petroleum, certain petroleum products, and natural gas, most of which are sold to the United States. For security reasons, there is export control on strategic goods to all destinations except the United States. All exports to Albania, Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Re- public and East Berlin, Hungary, the Democratic Peo- ple's Republic of Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, the U .S .S .R ., and Viet Nam are subject to control, 128 although certain goods of Canadian origin may be exported to these destinations under the authority of a general export permit. All exporters are eligible for certain financial facilities operated by the Export Development Corporation (EDC), including political risk insurance. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles No exchange control requirements are imposed on exchange payments for, or exchange receipts from, invisibles. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or payments by residents or nonresidents. Apart from specific restrictions in the financial, broad- casting, and uranium sectors, inward direct investment is governed by the Foreign Investment Review Act. This stipulates that the acquisition of control over a Canadian business enterprise by persons other than Canadians, or the establishment of a new business by such persons not previously established in Canada, or whose proposed new business is unrelated to their existing business in Canada, will be allowed if it is assessed that such investments are of significant benefit to Canada. A Foreign Investment Review Agency (FIRA) * is charged with the review of proposed takeovers and the screening of the establishment of new businesses. There are no controls over outward direct investment, nor over inward or outward portfolio investment. Although higher ratios may be authorized on a case-by-case basis, in general the domestic assets of a foreign-owned bank operating in Canada must not exceed 20 times its authorized capital; the total domestic assets of all such banks must not exceed 16 percent of the total domestic assets of all banks operating in Canada. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad. However, exports of gold and all other products containing gold to countries named in the Area Control List require an export permit from the Minister of Industry, Trade, and Commerce under the authority of the Export and Import Permits Act. Gold of U.S. origin requires a permit when re- exported to all countries except the United States. Commercial imports of articles containing minor quan- tities of gold, such as watches, are unrestricted and free of license. Legal tender gold coins with a face value of Can$100 have been issued annually since 1976, and Can$50 "bullion" coins, containing 1 ounce of gold, !'By the end of 1984, legislation was pending in the Canadian Parliament to replace the FIRA with a new organization to be called "Investment Canada," aimed, inter alia, at an easing of the review process for foreign investments in Canada. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution have also been issued since 1979. Beginning in 1982, Can$10 and Can$5 coins containing 1A and 'V ic ounces of gold, respectively, have also been issued. Changes During 1984 Imports and Import Payments January 1. Modifications were made in import policy and regulations as follows: (a) a further step was implemented in the staged Most Favored Nation tariff reductions agreed to by Canada in the MTN and proportionate reductions were made in many General Preferential Tariff rates for developing countries; (b) the bilateral clothing restraint arrangement with China was expanded to include dresses, skirts, athletic sets, and foundation garments; (c) a long-term bilateral textile and clothing restraint agreement was negotiated with In- donesia on pants, slacks, jeans, and tailored-collar shirts; (d) the consultation level on sportswear in the bilateral clothing restraint arrangement with Thailand was con- verted to a restraint level; and (e) a restraint level came into effect with Singapore on hosiery. February 15. The budget of February 15, 1984 introduced legislation to implement, effective January 1, 1985, a new system of customs valuation in line with Canada's GATT obligations. Also proposed for imple- mentation on January 1, 1985 were tariff increases related to the new valuation system. The budget also introduced legislation to expand the duty-free product coverage of the GATT Aircraft Agreement and to provide for a number of miscellaneous tariff changes. The proposed legislation was reintroduced in Parliament in conjunction with an economic statement on November 8, 1984, and was given royal assent on December 28, 1984. April 15. The bilateral textile and clothing restraint arrangement with Malaysia was expanded to include pants, shorts (effective July 1, 1984) and shirts, T-shirts, and sweatshirts on September 1, 1984. April 24. In response to a preliminary determination that sugar exported from the United States was being dumped on the Canadian market, a provisional duty was imposed at rates varying with the actual price of the sugar imports. May 1. Hosiery was added to the bilateral clothing restraint arrangement with Thailand. May 22. The Government announced that existing quotas on leather and nonleather footwear would be extended for 16 months beyond their scheduled expiry date on November 30, 1984. The quota level would continue to reflect the 3 percent annual growth rate which had been in effect since the current quotas were put in place in 1981 and 1982. In addition, existing price breaks on shoes, above which leather footwear is exempt from quota, were lowered from $45 per pair to $40 per pair and for boots from $75 per pair to $67 per pair. On November 29, 1984, the new Government shortened the quota extension to 12 months from 16 months. Existing quotas were then scheduled to expire on November 30, 1985. CANADA May 25. A new bilateral restraint arrangement came into effect with Mauritius on sweaters. June 12. The Government announced a renewed understanding with Japan regarding the level of passenger car exports to Canada. The announcement was based on a forecast by the Japanese Ministry of Interna- tional Trade and Industry that passenger car exports to Canada over the period April 1, 1984 to March 31, 1985 would not exceed 170,400 units. The new forecast represented a growth of about 11 percent over the level for the preceding year. June 14. The surtaxes on U .S. stainless steel were canceled in light of compensation provided by the United States in the form of exclusion of Canadian cement from Buy America provisions of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act. June 14. The following changes were made in regulations affecting imports: (a) legislation was passed with retroactive effect from June 30, 1983, to complete the due process for the implementation of the customs and tariff aspects of the new offshore policies announced by the Government on January 6, 1983, namely: the extension of the customs and excise regime beyond the 12-mile territorial limit to cover all goods (ships, floating structures, pipe, machinery, consumables, etc.) used in connection with resource-related activities on the Cana- dian continental shelf; elimination of the tariff prefer- ences on Commonwealth ships for the coasting trade and the preferences on other ships and floating structures from British Preferential and General Preferential Tariff Countries; tariff adjustments to clarify the dutiable status of ships and floating structures, to eliminate potential anomalies and to reduce the rate of floating drilling equipment from 25 percent to 20 percent; and (b) the Order in Council which, with effect from January 1, 1983, had imposed surtaxes on certain stainless steel materials imported from the United States was revoked. June 28. With retroactive effect from April 20, 1983 legislation was passed to complete the due process for implementation of the tariff changes introduced as part of the 1983 budget —namely, improvements in General Preferential Tariffs for developing countries, tariff in- creases on certain machinery parts, increases in the limits on the value of duty- and tax-free goods that can be brought back by Canadian tourists, and a number of tariff reductions on a range of goods including, but not limited to, firebrick and other refractories, electronic carillons, crawler machines and engines, mixing con- soles and tape recorders for sound recording studios. In addition, the Special Import Measures Act, which became effective December 1, 1984, was passed, replac- ing the Anti-Dumping Act and establishing similar internal procedures for lodging antidumping and antisub- sidy complaints against imports.

Not for Redistribution CAPE VERDE (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Cape Verde is the Cape Verde Escudo, which is pegged to a weighted basket of currencies representing nine important trading partners. The exchange rate of the Cape Verde escudo in terms of the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is fixed daily on the basis of quotations for the U.S. dollar and the other currencies included in the basket. On Decem- ber 31, 1984 the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were C .V. Esc 92.71 and C .V. Esc 93.32, respectively, per US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control All foreign exchange transactions are under the con- trol of the Directorate of Foreign Relations and Ex- change Control (DRECC), which is a department of the Bank of Cape Verde (the central bank). All imports, exports, and re-exports are subject to licensing, except for transactions not exceeding C .V. Esc 2,500. Foreign exchange transactions, including the surrender of foreign exchange proceeds, are effected through the central bank. Prescription of Currency The central bank determines the currency in which export proceeds should be repatriated. Cape Verde has bilateral payments agreements with Angola and Sao Tome and Principe. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents may open demand deposit accounts in local currency. These accounts may be credited only with the proceeds from the sale or surrender of receipts of convertible currencies and may be debited for pay- ment of any obligations in Cape Verde. Outward transfers from such accounts may be made freely. Embassies and foreign officials of embassies are re- quired to open special accounts in foreign currency and in local currency; such accounts must be replenished exclusively with foreign exchange. Special Accounts (Emigrants) Three types of special interest-bearing deposit ac- counts are available for emigrants: (a) foreign exchange deposit accounts; (b) savings-credit deposit accounts; and (c) special accounts in Cape Verde escudos. These accounts can only be credited with convertible foreign currencies. Holders of savings-credit deposit accounts can benefit from loans on special terms for financing small-scale projects. Imports and Import Payments All imports are subject to licensing, except for transactions not exceeding C.V. Esc 2,500. Licenses, which are issued by the General Directorate of Com- merce in the State Secretariat for Trade and Tourism, require the visa of the central bank and are generally valid for 180 days, but are renewable. The provision of foreign exchange is guaranteed when the license is approved by the central bank. Licenses are in general granted liberally for imports of medicines, capital goods, and other development-related equipment. Imports of nonessentials are restricted. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require prior authoriza- tion. Transfers for tourism are limited to a maximum of C .V. Esc 6,000 a person a year (C.V. Esc 3,000 for children under 15 years). When traveling accompanied by his family, a resident of Cape Verde may take out in foreign currency the equivalent of C .V. Esc 6,000 plus C .V. Esc 4,000 for each family member under 15, but the total transfer for each family may not exceed the equivalent of C .V. Esc 20,000. Cape Verdean nationals emigrating or going on tourist trips abroad are required to buy round-trip tickets in advance and to make a deposit equivalent to a one-way ticket to the country of destination; this deposit is refunded upon return to Cape Verde. Cape Verdean nationals studying abroad are allowed up to a maximum of C .V. Esc 6,000 on leaving the country, and students who do not hold scholarships are, in addition, entitled to C .V. Esc 5,000 a month. The equivalent of C .V. Esc 20,000 is authorized for each business trip and C .V. Esc 15,000 a trip for medical treatment; these latter amounts may be increased upon presentation of evidence of need. Transfers by foreign technical assistance personnel working in Cape Verde are authorized within the limits specified in the individual contracts. These contracts, as well as other contracts involving foreign exchange expenditures, are subject to prior screening by the central bank. Requests by other foreigners are examined on a case-by-case basis. The export of domestic currency by travelers is prohibited. Foreign travelers may bring in any amount of foreign currency but may re-export only the amount of currency declared upon entry. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports are subject to licensing and to approval by the central bank, except for transactions not exceeding C.V. Esc 2,500. Export proceeds must be repatriated within three months from the date of issuance of the license, but this period may be extended. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles must be surrendered to the central bank. The import of Cape Verdean bank notes is prohibited. 131 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CAPE VERDE Capital Any private capital transaction must be approved in advance by the central bank but legally imported capital may be re-exported without limitation. The export of resident-owned capital is not normally permitted. Gold Imports, exports, or re-exports of gold either in coin or bars require prior licensing by the monetary authorities. Changes During 1984 Special Accounts (Emigrants) June 1. A facility was instituted for the opening of the following types of special interest-bearing accounts by emigrants: (a) foreign exchange deposit accounts; (b) savings-credit deposit accounts; and (c) special accounts in Cape Verde escudos. The accounts were to be credited only with convertible foreign currencies; and holders of savings-credit deposit accounts could obtain loans on special terms for financing small-scale projects. 132 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Central African Republic is the CFA Franc,1 which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. Exchange transactions in French francs between the BEAC and commercial banks take place at the rate of CFAF 50 = F 1, free of commission. Buying and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also offi- cially posted, with quotations based on the fixed rate for the French franc and the rates for the currencies concerned in the Paris exchange market. A commission of 0.25 percent is levied on all capital transfers to countries that are not members of the BEAC, except those made for the account of the Treasury and for the expenses of students. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of those relating to gold, the exchange control measures of the Central African Re- public do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control All draft legislation, directives, correspondence, and contracts having a direct or indirect bearing on the finances of the State require the prior approval of the Minister of Finance, who has delegated his approval authority to the Director of the Budget. The Autonomous Amortization Fund (CAADE) in the Ministry of Finance supervises borrowing abroad, while the Office of For- eign Financial Relations in the same ministry supervises lending abroad, issuing, advertising, or offering for sale foreign securities in the Central African Republic, and inward and outward direct investment. Exchange control is administered by the Minister of Finance, who has delegated some of his approval authority to the BEAC ,2 to the authorized banks, and to the Postal Administra- tion. All exchange transactions relating to foreign coun- tries must be effected through authorized banks. Import and export licenses are issued by the Directorate of Foreign Trade in the Ministry of Commerce and Indus- try, except those for gold, which are issued by the BEAC. 1 The CFA franc circulating in the Central African Republic is issued by the Banque des Etats de 1'Afrique Centrale (BEAC) and is legal tender also in Cameroon, Chad, Congo, and Gabon. 2The authority delegated to the BEAC relates to (1) the control over the external position of the banks, (2) the granting of exceptional travel allocations in excess of the basic allowances, and (3) the control over the repatriation of net export proceeds. Prescription of Currency Since the Central African Republic is an Operations Account country, settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other institute of issue that maintains an Opera- tions Account with the French Treasury. Settlements with all other countries are usually made in any of the currencies of those countries or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. The principal nonresi- dent accounts are Foreign Accounts in Francs. BEAC bank notes received by the foreign correspondents of authorized banks and mailed to the BEAC agency in Bangui by the Bank of France or the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de 1'Quest (BCEAO) may be credited freely to Foreign Accounts in Francs. Imports and Import Payments All imports from South Africa are suspended. The import from all countries of a few commodities that are also produced domestically is prohibited. The import of certain foodstuffs is not authorized unless local produc- tion of these commodities is inadequate. Imports of certain goods, when not originating in a member country of the Central African Customs and Economic Union (UDEAC), may be made only in given ratios to purchases of the local product. The import of firearms is prohibited irrespective of origin. All other imports from countries in the French Franc Area may be made freely and without an import license. All other imports from EC countries (the original member states) also are free from quantitative restrictions. Imports from all countries outside the French Franc Area are subject to licensing within the framework of an annual import program. All import transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank. The import license entitles importers to purchase the necessary exchange, provided that the shipping documents are submitted to the authorized bank. There has been some accrual of arrears on external payments owing to the imposition of statutory ceilings on central bank credit to the Govern- ment and an ensuing shortage of domestic currency with which to purchase foreign exchange. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to approval. For many types of payment the approval authority has been delegated to authorized banks. Pay- ments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely 133 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, divi- dends, and royalties are also permitted freely when the basic transaction has been approved. Residents traveling as tourists to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may obtain an exchange allocation of an amount equivalent to CFAF 50,000 a year for each person; of this allocation, an amount equivalent to CFAF 25,000 may be taken out in foreign bank notes. Any exchange in excess of the equivalent of CFAF 5,000 that remains after return to the Central African Republic must be surrendered. For business travel to foreign countries, there is a special allocation of the equivalent of CFAF 10,000 a person a day, subject to a maximum of CFAF 100,000 a trip, for travel to certain listed countries; the allocation for business travel to any other foreign country is CFAF 15,000 a day, up to CFAF 150,000 a trip; of this allocation, an amount equivalent to CFAF 5,000 may be taken out in foreign bank notes. The transfer of the entire net salary of a foreigner working in the Central African Republic is permitted upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher, provided that the transfer takes place within three months of the pay period. Travelers to foreign countries may take out up to a maximum of CFAF 10,000 in BE AC bank notes, French bank notes, and bank notes issued by any other institute of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury. Travelers to other countries may take out any amount in BE AC bank notes. Nonresident travelers may take out foreign currency and other foreign means of payment up to the amount declared by them on entry; they may reconvert up to CFAF 50,000 in BEAC bank notes into foreign currency. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are suspended. All exports of cotton, coffee, corn, tobacco, peanuts, palm oil, meat, and diamonds require a license. All other exports to countries in the French Franc Area may be made freely. All exports to countries outside this area require licenses, which are issued freely. Proceeds from exports to foreign countries must be collected and repatriated within one month from the due date; the latter must not be later than 90 days after the arrival of the goods at their destination, unless special authorization is obtained. Export proceeds received in currencies other than those of France or an Operations Account country must be surrendered. All export trans- actions must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Ac- count countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services, and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets, 134 must be collected within a month of the due date and, if received in foreign currency, surrendered within a month of the date of receipt. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BEAC, the Bank of France, or any other bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) of countries outside the French Franc Area. Capital Capital movements between the Central African Re- public and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require exchange control approval and are restricted, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. All foreign borrowing by the Government or its public and semipublic enterprises, as well as all foreign borrowing with a government guarantee, requires the prior approval of the Director of the Budget. Special controls (additional to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable) are maintained over borrowing and lending abroad, over inward and outward direct investment, and over the issuing, adver- tising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in the Central African Republic; these controls relate to the transactions themselves, not to payments or receipts. With the exception of those controls over the sale or introduction of foreign securities in the Central African Republic, the measures do not apply to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries. Direct investments abroad3 require the prior approval of the Ministry of Finance unless they take the form of a capital increase resulting from reinvestment of undis- tributed profits; the full or partial liquidation of such investments also requires the prior approval of the Ministry of Finance unless the operation involves the relinquishing of a participation that had previously been approved as constituting a direct investment abroad. Foreign direct investments in the Central African Re- public4 must be declared to the Minister of Finance unless they take the form of a capital increase resulting from reinvestment of undistributed profits; the Minister has a period of two months from receipt of the declaration during which he may request postponement. The full or partial liquidation of direct investments in the Central African Republic must also be declared to the Minister, unless the operation involves the relinquishing of a participation that had previously been approved as constituting a direct investment in the Central African Republic. Both the making and the liquidation of direct 3 Including those made through foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in the Central African Republic and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in the Central African Republic. 4 Including those made by companies in the Central African Republic that are directly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries of foreign companies in the Central African Republic. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution investments, whether these are Central African Republic investments abroad or foreign investments in the Central African Republic, must be reported to the Minister within 20 days following each operation. Direct invest- ments are defined as investments implying control of a company or an enterprise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in the Central African Republic requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. Exempt from authorization, however, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Govern- ment and (2) shares similar to securities whose issuing, advertising, or offering for sale in the Central African Republic has previously been authorized. Borrowing abroad by physical or juridical persons, whether public or private, whose normal residence or registered office is in the Central African Republic, or by branches or subsidiaries in the Central African Republic of juridical persons whose registered office is abroad, requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authoriza- tion: (1) loans constituting a direct investment abroad for which prior approval has been obtained, as indicated above; (2) loans directly connected with the rendering of services abroad by the persons or firms mentioned above, or with the financing of commercial transactions either between the Central African Republic and coun- tries abroad or between foreign countries, in which those persons or firms take part; (3) loans contracted by registered banks; and (4) loans other than those men- tioned above, when the total amount outstanding of the loans does not exceed CFAF 50 million for any one borrower. The contracting of loans referred to under (4) that are free of authorization, and each repayment thereon, must be reported to the Office of Foreign Financial Relations within 20 days of the operation, unless the total outstanding amount of all loans con- tracted abroad by the borrower is less than CFAF 500,000. Lending abroad by physical or juridical persons, whose normal residence or registered office is in the Central African Republic, or by branches or subsidiaries in the Central African Republic of juridical persons whose registered office is abroad, requires prior authori- zation by the Minister of Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans granted by registered banks and (2) other loans when the total amount outstanding of the loans does not exceed CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC CFAF 50 million for any one lender. The making of loans that are free of authorization, and each repayment thereon, must be reported to the Office of Foreign Financial Relations within 20 days of the operation except when the amount of the loan granted abroad by the lender is less than CFAF 500,000. Under Law No. 62/355 of February 19, 1963 (as amended by Ordinance No. 69/47 of September 2, 1969) and UDEAC Decision No. 18/65 of December 14, 1965, industrial, tourist, agricultural, and mining enterprises (both foreign and domestic) established in the Central African Republic are granted, under certain conditions, a reduction in duties and taxes on the import of specified equipment; in addition, certain enterprises receive ex- emption from direct taxes on specified income. The law also provides for three categories of preferen- tial treatment in accordance with which fiscal and other privileges may be accorded to firms investing in new enterprises or in the expansion of existing ones in most sectors of the economy, except the commercial sector. Requests for approval for preferential treatment must be submitted to the Minister of Industry, who is the Chairman of the Investment Commission which con- siders the application. If a positive decision has been given by the Commission, the proposed authorization is submitted to the Council of Ministers. Preferential treatments A and C are granted by decree issued by the Council of Ministers. Preferential treatment B is granted by an Act of the Board of Directors of the former Equatorial Customs Union upon the recommendation of the Council of Ministers. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in the Central African Republic. Imports and exports of gold from or to any other country require a license, which is seldom granted; in practice, imports and exports are made by an authorized pur- chasing office. Exempt from prior authorization are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the Treasury and (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles). Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Certain companies have been officially appointed as Offices for the Purchase, Import, and Export of Gold and Raw Diamonds. Changes During 1984 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 135 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CHAD (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Chad is the CFA Franc,1 which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. Exchange transac- tions in French francs between the BEAC and commer- cial banks take place at the rate of CFAF 50 = F 1. Buying and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also officially posted, with quotations based on the fixed rate for the French franc and the rates for the currencies concerned in the Paris exchange market. A commission of 0.25 percent is levied on all capital transfers to countries that are not members of the BEAC, except those made for the account of the Treasury and for the expenses of students. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of those relating to gold, Chad's exchange control measures do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Comoros, the Congo, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control The Office of the Minister of Economy and Com- merce supervises borrowing and lending abroad, the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Chad, and inward and outward direct investment; it also issues import and export authoriza- tions for gold. Exchange control is also administered by the Minister of Economy and Commerce, who has dele- gated his approval authority in part to the authorized banks. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through authorized banks. Import and export licenses are issued by the Foreign Trade Office in the Ministry of Economy and Commerce. Prescription of Currency Since Chad is an Operations Account country, set- tlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury. Settlements with all other countries are usually made through correspondent banks in France in any of the currencies of those countries or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. !The CFA franc circulating in Chad is issued by the Banque des Etats de 1'Afrique Centrale (BEAC) and is legal tender also in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Congo, and Gabon. 136 Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. BEAC bank notes may be credited freely to Foreign Accounts in Francs main- tained by the foreign correspondent of an authorized bank, provided that the notes are mailed to the BEAC agency in Chad by the correspondent bank concerned. Imports and Import Payments Imports from South Africa are prohibited. Imports of wheat, wheat flour, and sugar from all sources require licenses. All other imports from countries in the French Franc Area and from EC countries (the original member states), other than France, may be made freely. All imports from non-EC countries outside the French Franc Area are subject to licensing in accordance with an annual import program. This program and the amount of foreign exchange required to implement it are deter- mined by the Minister of Economy and Commerce on the basis of proposals drawn up by the Committee on Imports. The import program contains global quotas for im- ports from non-EC countries outside the French Franc Area and a special quota for imports of cotton textiles from countries with abnormal competitive advantages. In addition, the program contains global quotas for imports of wheat, wheat flour, and sugar from EC countries, countries in the French Franc Area, as well as other countries. Specified imports from certain neigh- boring countries not belonging to the French Franc Area up to a value of CFAF 3 million a year in each direction for a single importer may be made through compensation transactions. The issuance of import licenses for sugar and a specified brand of cigarettes has been suspended until further notice. All import transactions valued at CFAF 100,000 or more and relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Import licenses entitle import- ers to purchase the necessary exchange, provided that the shipping documents are submitted to the authorized bank. Forward cover for imports from foreign countries is permitted only for specified commodities and requires the prior approval of the Office of the Minister of Economy and Commerce. There has been some accumu- lation of arrears on external payments owing to the imposition of statutory ceilings on central bank credit to the Government and an ensuing shortage of domestic currency with which to purchase foreign exchange. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to approval. For many types of payment the approval ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution authority has been delegated to authorized banks. Pay- ments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, divi- dends, and royalties are also permitted freely when bona fide. Some current payments, however, may be subject to delay. For tourist travel, residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may obtain an exchange allocation of an amount equivalent to CFAF 200,000 a person a trip, for any number of trips a year. For pilgrimage to Mecca, an additional allocation of the equivalent of CFAF 200,000 may be granted. For business travel to foreign countries, there is a daily allocation of the equivalent of CFAF 60,000, with a maximum allocation of the equivalent of up to CFAF 500,000 a person a trip; the Office of the Minister of Economy and Commerce may approve additional amounts. Travelers to foreign countries may take out up to a maximum of CFAF 30,000 in BEAC bank notes. Travelers to other countries may take out any amount in BEAC bank notes. Nonresident travelers may take out foreign bank notes and coin up to the amount declared by them on entry, in addition to amounts remitted from foreign bank ac- counts. If no declaration has been made, they may take out up to the equivalent of CFAF 150,000, in addition to a maximum of CFAF 30,000 in BEAC bank notes. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to South Africa are prohibited. All exports to non-EC countries outside the French Franc Area require licenses. Specified exports to certain neighboring coun- tries, including Nigeria and Sudan, may be made through compensation transactions. Exports of cotton are the monopoly of the Societe Cotonniere du Tchad (COTONTCHAD). Export transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value exceeds CFAF 50,000. Export proceeds received in currencies other than those of France or an Operations Account country must be surrendered. Export proceeds normally must be received within 180 days after the arrival of the commodities at their destination. The proceeds must be collected, and be surrendered if received in a foreign currency, within one month of the due date. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and Operations Account countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services, and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets, must be collected and, if received in foreign currency, be surrendered within two months of the due date. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of CHAD bank notes and coin issued by the BEAC, the Bank of France, or any other bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) and other foreign means of payment. Foreign bank notes and coin in excess of the equivalent of CFAF 20,000 brought in by residents must be exchanged for CFA francs within eight days of their return. Capital Capital movements between Chad and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require exchange control approval and are restricted, but capital receipts from such coun- tries are permitted freely. All foreign securities, foreign currency, and titles embodying claims on foreign coun- tries or nonresidents that are held in Chad by residents or nonresidents must be deposited with authorized banks in Chad. Special controls (additional to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable or suspended insofar as they would be contrary to the exchange control regulations) are maintained over borrowing and lending abroad, over inward and outward direct investment, and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Chad; these controls relate to the transactions themselves, not to payments or receipts. With the exception of those controls over the sale or introduction of foreign securities in Chad, the measures do not apply to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries. Direct investments abroad2 require the prior approval of the Minister of Economy and Commerce, irrespective of the method of financing; the fu ll or partial liquidation of such investments also requires the prior approval of the Minister. Foreign direct investments in Chad3 re- quire the prior approval of the Minister of Economy and Commerce unless they take the form of a mixed- economy enterprise. The fu ll or partial liquidation of direct investments in Chad must also be declared to the Minister. Both the making and the liquidation of direct investments, whether these are Chadian investments abroad or foreign investments in Chad, must be reported to the Minister within 20 days of each operation. Direct investments are defined as investments implying control of a company or enterprise. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Chad requires prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Commerce.

Under the Investment Code of August 26, 1963, any enterprise established in Chad, whether domestic or foreign, is granted, under certain conditions, reduced duties and taxes on specified imports, as well as exemption from direct taxes on specified income. The Code also provides for three categories of preferential treatment, in accordance with which certain fiscal and other privileges may be accorded to firms investing in specified new industries or in the expansion of existing ones. Requests for preferential treatment must be sub- mitted to the Minister of Economy and Commerce, who, after examining the documents, transmits them to the Investment Commission. After an opinion has been given by that Commission, the project is submitted to the Council of Ministers. Gold Chad has issued gold coins with face values of CFAF 1,000, 3,000, 5,000, 10,000, and 20,000, which are legal tender. Residents who are not producers of gold may not hold unworked gold unless specifically autho- rized. Imports and exports of gold, whether unworked or refined, require prior authorization by the Office of the Minister of Economy and Commerce and by the Direc- torate of Energy, Mines, and Geology as well as the visa of the Foreign Trade Office. Exempt from this require- ment are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles). Exports of unworked gold and of raw diamonds (as well as domestic purchases and sales of both) are the monopoly of the Office for Purchases, Sales, Imports, and Exports (BAVIE), which is an approved private company. Un- worked gold may be exported only to France. Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Changes During 1984 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 138 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CHILE (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement1 The currency of Chile is the Chilean Peso (Ch$). Beginning December 17, 1983, the official exchange rate of the Chilean peso is pegged to the U.S. dollar, at a rate adjusted at daily intervals according to a schedule established for a monthly period ahead on the basis of the domestic rate of inflation during the previous month, less the world rate of inflation estimated for this purpose at not more than 0.5 percent a month. On December 31, 1984 the official exchange rate was Ch$127.80 per US$1. Foreign exchange dealers, the Banco del Estado, commercial banks, exchange houses, and other autho- rized entities must trade in foreign exchange only at the official rate, but direct transactions in foreign exchange among private parties can take place at freely negotiated exchange rates provided that they are occasional, non- customary, and without publicity. Commissions on exchange transactions are subject to a 20 percent value- added tax. The exchange rates of the Chilean peso with other currencies are determined on the basis of the peso exchange rate with respect to the U.S. dollar, and of the U.S. dollar exchange rate with respect to other curren- cies quoted in foreign markets. A preferential exchange rate was established on September 3, 1982 as a basis for computing a subsidy on service payments on external debt contracted before August 6, 1982. The following have access to the subsidy: (1) debtors to Chilean banks or financial companies whose debt is indexed to the official ex- change rate; and (2) debtors with direct obligations abroad whose obligations were registered with the Central Bank. The preferential rate was fixed at Ch$49.623 per US$1 on August 6, 1982, and is readjusted daily on the basis of the increase in the consumer price index of the previous month. A subsidy equal to the difference between the preferential and the official rate is paid by means of notes with a maturity of between six and ten years, and bearing a 3 percent rate of interest. On December 31, 1984 the preferential ex- change rate was Ch$89.02 per US$1. Administration of Control The Executive Committee of the Central Bank is responsible for carrying out currency exchange policy. The Chilean Copper Commission is responsible for the supervision of copper exports and all imports of the copper industry; this supervision has to be exercised in accordance with general rules enacted by the Central Bank. 'On February 27, 1985, in connection with the reduction in import tariffs to a uniform rate of 30 percent, the exchange rate of the Chilean peso was changed from Ch$132.17 = US$1 to Ch$144.07 = US$1, representing a devaluation of 8.3 percent. Prescription of Currency Settlements with Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colom- bia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela must be made through accounts maintained with each other by the Central Bank of Chile and the central banks of each of the countries concerned, within the framework of the multilateral clearing system of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA). Set- tlements with the Dominican Republic must be made through clearing accounts established under a reciprocal credit agreement. Settlements with other countries take place in specified convertible currencies. Imports and Import Payments Most imports are free, with the exception of used motor vehicles. All imports require a document (known as Informe de Importation) issued by the Central Bank, which can be obtained and processed through the intermediary local commercial bank. Payment for visible trade transactions is not permitted unless an Informe de Importation has been issued. Since March 23, 1983 imports are subject to a 120-day minimum financing requirement. Importers may pur- chase spot exchange before the payment date and place a deposit in foreign exchange at the Central Bank in anticipation of payment. Imports on deferred payment terms (cobertura diferida), that is, on credit terms exceeding 360 days, require prior authorization of the credit terms by the Central Bank, Virtually all imports are subject to a registration tax of up to 3 percent of value, which is offset against the applicable import duty. Since September 22, 1984, imports are subject to a uniform 35 percent2 tariff rate with some exceptions. Among the exceptions are motor vehicles and parts thereof, the tariffs of which are scheduled to decrease gradually to 10 percent by 1986. Other exceptions include tariffs bound under the GATT and tariffs negotiated with LAI A countries. Specific duties exist on imports of some dairy products, in particular powdered milk. Payments for Invisibles Specified allowances exist for certain transactions; central bank authorization is required for others. The authorization is provided upon presentation of appropri- ate documentation. The established limit for tourist travel (in addition to the fares) is the equivalent of US$200 a month for travel to Latin America and Caribbean countries and of US$800 a month to other countries. For travel by land, 20 percent of the allowance is provided in the form of foreign exchange and the rest 2On February 27, 1985, the uniform import tariff rate was reduced from 35 percent to 30 percent. 139 ©International Monetary Fund.

Residents may purchase up to US$200 a month for study abroad, subscriptions to magazines, books, and pension payments, subject to presentation of appropriate documents. Insurance activities within the country are limited to Chilean companies or to authorized foreign companies. Exports and Export Proceeds All commodities may be freely exported. All foreign exchange proceeds from exports in excess of US$1,000 must be surrendered through commercial banks, which are required to advise immediately the Director of Operations of the Central Bank (the Chilean Copper Commission in the case of copper). Commercial banks are authorized to purchase all foreign exchange proceeds spot from exporters. Exporters are allowed to retain up to 5 percent of export proceeds in a special Foreign Exchange Account, but the cumulative deposits in any such account during a 12-month period may not exceed US$100,000. Receipts from exports of the large copper mines must be deposited in a special foreign currency account at the Central Bank. Export proceeds subject to surrender requirements must be repatriated within 90 days from the date of shipment and surrendered within 10 days from the date of repatriation; for specified goods this period may be extended. A maximum maturity of 270 days is fixed for export credits opened prior to shipment. Shipment of the merchandise must take place not later than 240 days from the concession of the export credit. Proceeds from Invisibles In general, foreign exchange proceeds from invisibles must be surrendered only when required by a legal provision. Such is the case for commissions, proceeds from insurance, and other benefits related to foreign trade. There are no similar rules concerning the proceeds from royalties and copyright fees, family remittances, and the surplus foreign exchange from travel allocations. Capital Capital inflows are generally free, but most outflows are restricted. All new foreign borrowing or refinancing of existing credits by commercial banks requires prior approval by the Central Bank, with the exception of the taking up of lines of credit of up to one-year maturity with foreign correspondents and short-term loans for domestic relending up to a limit determined mainly by a bank's capital and reserves. Foreign capital may enter Chile under one of three different arrangements, depend- ing on the purpose and type of the investment, as follows: (1) Article 14 of Decree No. 471 of October 17, 1977 stipulates that capital brought into the country in the form of foreign exchange (aporte de capital) may be sold 140 freely through authorized banks when the investor (individual or corporate, national or foreign) has regis- tered the transaction with the Central Bank. There is no minimum term on the maturity of foreign borrowing. Repatriation normally is allowed only in accordance with the amortization schedule established at the time of registration. Accelerated payments or extensions of payment are subject to special authorization. All foreign borrowing undertaken after November 10, 1983 with average maturities of less than 60 months is subject to a 5 percent reserve deposit requirement. (2) Article 15 of the same decree authorizes the Central Bank to make exemptions to the general rules enacted by it concerning the inflow and outflow of capital or credits. (3) Decree-Law No. 600 of July 7, 1974 (amended by Decree-Law No. 1748 of March 18, 1977), the Foreign Investment Statute, establishes a regime for long-term capital investment. Authorization to make a foreign exchange investment in Chile is granted by the Foreign Investment Committee through a contract containing undertakings regarding the phasing of the investment program that will normally not exceed eight years for mining and three years for other projects. Investments of less than US$5 million may be approved by the Execu- tive Secretary of the Committee, with a few exceptions. There are no limitations on profit remittances. Capital may be repatriated after three years. Foreign investors can opt for a guaranteed 49.5 percent a year total corporation income tax over a period of ten years, or may subject themselves to the tax system applicable to domestic corporations (currently 48.5 percent). Any foreign credits involved must be on terms authorized by the Central Bank. Foreign capital that entered Chile prior to the promulgation of Decree-Law No. 600 and which did not opt to be subject to that law continues to be subject to the regulations prevailing on the date of entry. Foreign investment in the oil sector is subject to authorization by the Empresa Nacional de Petroleo (ENAP). The Central Bank provides access to the forward exchange market (on the basis of the Unidad de Fomento (U.F.), a reference monetary unit adjusted daily in line with the provisions of Supreme Decree No. 40 of January 2, 1967) for foreign borrowings to cover interest and amortization payments and for new loans to enter- prises operating in the nontradable sector. The guarantee is limited to a cumulative figure of US$40 million. Gold Chile has issued three types of gold coin, which are not legal tender. Monetary gold may be traded only by authorized houses, but ordinary transactions in gold between private individuals may be freely undertaken. Imports and exports of gold are unrestricted, subject to compliance with the normal formalities for import and export transactions, including registration with the Cen- tral Bank. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement February 23. Rules on payment of the subsidy tied to the preferential exchange rate were tightened by exclud- ing from the subsidy all public sector entities, restraining access by exporters, increasing the maturity of notes issued for subsidy payments from 3-5 years to 6-10 years, and reducing the real annual interest rates on the notes from 7 percent to 3 percent. September 18. The exchange rate of the peso was changed from Ch$93 per US$1 to Ch$115 per US$1, representing a devaluation of 19.1 percent. November 9. In a temporary modification of the rule for setting the daily official exchange rate of the peso for the month ahead, the daily rate of devaluation in relation to the U.S. dollar was set at 0.13082 percent, equivalent to 4 percent in a month. December 8. The exchange rate of the peso was changed from Ch$122.3 per US$1 to Ch$126.9 per US$1, representing a devaluation of 3.6 percent. In CHILE addition, the pre-November rule for setting the daily official exchange rate schedule for the following month was restored. Imports and Import Payments May 2. Official price ranges were established for the imports of wheat and oilseeds. July 18. A 15 percent import surcharge was imposed on products under 248 tariff categories, including luxury goods, household products, footwear, clothing, and appliances. (The new tax replaced a temporary 15 per- cent surcharge on some 35 customs categories, but were additional to existing surcharges on products covered by about 45 customs categories.) September 22. Import duties were increased to a uniform level of 35 percent and all existing surcharges were eliminated. December 18. The Ministers of Economy and Finance announced that tariffs would be rolled back to a uniform level of 30 percent by end-June 1985, and to a uniform level of 25 percent before mid-1986. 141 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA (Position on January 3, 1985)1 Exchange Arrangement The currency of the People's Republic of China is the Renminbi and its unit is the yuan. The exchange rate of the renminbi is adjusted in accordance with movements in the value of a basket of internationally traded currencies, weighted with reference to their importance in China's external transactions and the trends in their relative values. The yuan-U.S. dollar rate is calculated directly from the value of the basket, while rates for 21 other currencies2 are determined from the cross rates. The exchange rate is published on a daily basis by the State Administration of Exchange Control; on January 3, 1985 the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were Y 2.8027 and Y 2.8167, respectively, per US$1. Published rates for currencies other than those that are important in China's international transactions are changed whenever the calculated rate diverges from the previously published rate by 1 percent; for the important currencies, such as the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen, a smaller margin of 0.5 percent is applied. Settlement for all spot transactions is effected at the official exchange rate. An experimental foreign exchange trading system has been established by the Bank of China in a few areas (such as Beijing, Guangdong, Hefei, Shanghai, and Tianjin), under which national enterprises holding foreign exchange earned through the system of retention quotas are permitted to sell such foreign exchange to other national enterprises that have a quota for spending foreign exchange. The Bank of China acts as a broker and levies a commission of 0.1 percent on both sides of the transaction, but does not operate in this trading system on its own account or provide foreign exchange or take up positions in foreign exchange. Most transac- tions are in U.S. dollars, but Hong Kong dollars and pounds sterling are also traded. Forward exchange rates are published for 15 curren- cies.3 China does not apply a system of forward premiums and discounts but instead uses the spot rate plus a forward charge. Forward transactions are only permitted in connection with an underlying trade transac- tion. When banks sell renminbi forward, a charge is levied; when they buy, no charge is levied except for the 1 The extension of the cutoff date beyond the usual December 31, 1984 point is intended to permit inclusion of important reforms in China's exchange and trade system which came into effect in early January 1985, including discontinuation of use of the internal set- tlement rate. 2Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Ghanaian cedis, Hong Kong dollars, Iranian rials, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Pakistan rupees, pounds sterling, Sierra Leonean leones, Singapore dollars, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. 3Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Hong Kong dollars, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds ster- ling, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. 142 Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. Rates are given for one to six months; transactions can be renewed for a further six months, but for not longer than one year. Forward charges reflect interest rates and trends in international markets in the currencies concerned. Administration of Control The People's Bank of China exercises central bank function and control over foreign exchange; and the State Administration of Exchange Control (SAEC), as a government administration under the leadership of the People's Bank of China, is responsible for implementing the exchange regulations and controlling all foreign exchange transactions in accordance with state policy. There are sub-bureaus in the provinces, in main municipalities, autonomous regions, and special eco- nomic zones. Other banks and financial institutions, including affiliates of nonresident banks, may handle designated transactions with the approval of the SAEC. The China International Trust and Investment Corpora- tion (CITIC) is authorized to conduct transactions con- nected with investments of foreign capital in China and any other foreign exchange transactions in the special economic zones. Individuals and institutions may hold foreign exchange but may not deal in it or conduct arbitrage operations. Special exchange control regula- tions apply to special economic zones, the 14 designated coastal cities, and border regions. Foreign exchange transactions are generally made in accordance with a foreign exchange plan. Those parts of the foreign exchange plan dealing with foreign trade, foreign loans, and China's external assistance program are prepared by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade (MOFERT); the foreign exchange budgets of other government departments are prepared by the Ministry of Finance. The SAEC draws up the section of the plan covering local and provincial non- trade transactions, receipts from overseas Chinese, and individual receipts. The overall foreign exchange plan is coordinated and balanced by the SAEC; after it has been reviewed and reconciled with other plans by the State Planning Commission, it is submitted to the State Council for approval. Following approval, the plan is sent back to the various localities and ministries for implementation. The Bank of China is responsible for supervising the implementation of the foreign exchange plan. In principle, the foreign exchange plan covers all transactions, including those with countries with which China maintains bilateral payments agreements.4 The 4 China maintains operative bilateral payments agreements with the following Fund members: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, Hungary, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Pakistan, Romania, and Sierra Leone. It also maintains bilateral payments agreements with Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Mongolia, Poland, and the U .S .S .R. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution annual plan is divided into quarterly plans, and, at the end of each quarter, the State Planning Commission reviews the implementation of the plan and determines whether corrections are necessary. That part of the foreign exchange plan dealing with trade is broken down by commodity. Unexpected events, such as changes in foreign trade policies, might necessitate a revision of the plan. Prescription of Currency Trade transactions with Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, and the U .S .S .R. are expressed in Swiss francs, and with Cuba in pounds sterling, at the official exchange rate and settled through bilateral payments arrangements. In normal circumstances, imbalances emerging toward the end of each year are covered by increased deliveries of goods. Noncommercial transac- tions are settled on a current basis in convertible currencies, except for part of such transactions with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Romania, and all the transactions with Cuba, which pass through the clearing account. Payments to and from countries with which China has bilateral payments agreements are made in the currencies and in accordance with the procedures set forth in those agreements. In other cases, where there are no specific regulations prescribing the currencies to be used in transactions, they are determined by terms agreed under the respective contracts. Bilateral trade and payments agreements are of two kinds: Type A agreements are designed to ensure balanced trade and include, for each good itemized, quantitative commodity lists or foreign exchange quota lists for those com- modities that cannot be expressed in quantitative terms; these lists are binding on both parties. Most ar- rangements are of this type. Type B agreements (those with the Islamic Republic of Iran and Sierra Leone) provide such binding itemized lists only for the principal goods traded by the parties and also include nonbinding lists of secondary goods. Nonresident and Foreign Currency Accounts Nonresidents5 in China for a short period may open nonresident accounts with the Bank of China. Joint ventures may also open foreign exchange accounts and use them to make payments abroad. With the permission of the Bank of China, foreign banks may hold convert- ible renminbi accounts in connection with commercial or noncommercial transactions. Renminbi may be pur- chased for such an account only on presentation of documentary evidence that the money will be used in the designated transaction. The Bank of China may check any use made of renminbi in such accounts. Individuals may, under certain conditions, open resi- dent foreign currency accounts at the Bank of China. 5 Nonresidents include overseas Chinese and residents of foreign countries, and of the Hong Kong and Macao regions. Foreign embassies are also included. PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA Imports and Exports All trade, both direct and indirect, with Israel, the Republic of Korea, and South Africa is prohibited. The primary responsibility for formulating foreign trade policies and ensuring the implementation of regula- tions and policy measures rests with the MOFERT, which also issues the licenses required for all imports and a large number of exports; following the reform in the exchange and trade system effected in early 1985, the MOFERT no longer engages in direct foreign trade transactions and is no longer involved in daily enterprise management. Foreign trade is conducted by national foreign trade corporations and other entities licensed by the MOFERT to conduct foreign trade. Exporters and importers can freely choose their agents; however, a limited number of essential import commodities continue to be handled by one of the 14 national foreign trade corporations. All enterprises, other than registered national foreign trade corporations, need a license from the local foreign trade bureau to engage in trade or hold foreign exchange. Part of the proceeds of certain exports may be retained in a foreign exchange deposit or foreign exchange quota account with the Bank of China; such foreign exchange may also be sold to other authorized enterprises through the experimental trading system established by the Bank of China. All other foreign exchange earnings from exports must be repatriated and surrendered to the Bank of China, unless specific exception is granted by the SAEC. Before using their holdings of foreign exchange, enterprises other than the national foreign trade corpora- tions must seek the approval of the SAEC. The Bank of China provides foreign exchange for imports on the basis of import licenses and approval by the SAEC. Foreign trade is based on an annual foreign trade plan drawn up by the MOFERT in conjunction with the State Planning Commission. The former sends directives on the preparation of the plan to all foreign trade corpora- tions and to the foreign trade bureaus in the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, which, in turn, meet with other interested entities and prepare lists of needed imports and goods available for export. The plans prepared at the local level are coordinated and balanced by the MOFERT and the State Planning Commission at national foreign trade planning confer- ences. The State Council grants final approval to the foreign trade plan. Goods which can be produced domestically, or for which adequate domestic substitutes are available, are not included in the import plan. Priority is given in the import plan to goods that cannot be produced domes- tically in adequate quantities and those that are urgently needed by the State, especially for key projects. In the case of some goods that are not produced in adequate quantities but for which a good foreign market exists, part of the production may be allocated to export. Importation of goods previously exported from China requires special authorization. The import and export of 143 ©International Monetary Fund.

In addition, imports of poisons, narcotic drugs, diseased animals, and plants are prohibited, as is the export of valuable cultural relics and rare books, rare animals and plants, and precious metals and artifacts made from these metals. All imports and exports require prior inspection before the release by the General Administration of Customs. Exports of specified machine tools require a license from the State Adminis- tration for the Inspection of Import and Export Com- modities, as a means of quality control. The customs regulations in force are the Provisional Customs Law of the People's Republic of China and the Customs Import and Export Tariff of the People's Republic of China. Except for imports into Tibet, China applies a two-column import tariff with a general rate and a minimum rate. The minimum rate is applied to goods from those countries with which China has concluded reciprocal commercial treaties.6 The general rate applies to all other countries. Import duties are generally levied on the c . i .f. value of goods. Under the general tariff, dutiable imports are subject to one of 24 rates ranging from 7.5 percent to 250 percent, while those under the minimum tariff are subject to one of 20 rates ranging from 5 percent to 150 percent. Imports into Tibet from abroad are subject to a separate system of customs duties established by the Tibetan People's Government. The tariff, however, only applies to goods imported directly into Tibet for use there. It does not apply to imports of other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions through Tibet, or to imports through Tibet by mail or brought in as part of the luggage carried by travelers; such imports are subject to the regular Chinese tariff. In addition to customs duties, a consolidated industrial and commercial tax (a turnover tax applied also to other commodities) is levied on imports in accordance with the list contained in the Draft Regulations of the Con- solidated Industrial and Commercial Tax of the People's 6These countries are as follows (classified by geographical areas): (1) Africa: Benin, Burundi, Cameroon, the Central African Re- public, Chad, the Congo, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Tunisia, Zaire, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

Raw materials imported for further processing are exempted from both customs duties and commercial taxes, provided that the products are all exported within a specified period. Most imports and exports by joint ventures are exempt from customs duties. Export duties are levied on exports of 34 different commodities. Localities and enterprises may retain part of foreign exchange earned from export (including net foreign exchange earnings in a compensation trade), in accor- dance with state regulations. The percentage of export earnings that can be retained varies with the enterprise. Special economic zones have been set up in Shantou, Shenzhen, Xiamen, and Zhuhai, and new technology development areas have been established in 14 desig- nated coastal cities. Foreigners, overseas Chinese, and Chinese from the Hong Kong and Macao regions are permitted to open factories in these zones and areas for manufacturing products for export markets. Imports into such zones and areas intended for processing and re- export and a number of other specified imports are exempt from import duties and the consolidated indus- trial and commercial tax, while customs duties and the consolidated industrial and commercial tax on exports may be waived. Invisibles Enterprises must sell their foreign exchange earnings from invisibles to the Bank of China, except for the portion they may retain in accordance with specific regulations. Foreign exchange remitted from abroad or from the Hong Kong and Macao regions to Chinese residents must be surrendered to the Bank of China, except for the 10 percent which may be retained when the remitted amount is equivalent to Y 3,000 or more. For residents of China repatriating foreign exchange held abroad or in the Hong Kong and Macao regions before October 1, 1949, or inherited after that date, up to 30 percent of such inward remittances may be retained. Similarly, up to 30 percent of foreign exchange owned by immigrants or returning Chinese before becoming residents may be retained, provided that application is made within two months following entry into China. Such retained foreign exchange may be sold to the Bank of China or remitted through the Bank of China, or taken out of China against certification by the Bank of China. All foreign exchange earned by Chinese residents when working abroad, or in the Hong Kong or Macao regions, or earned from publication fees, copyright fees, awards, subsidies, honoraria, or other premiums, must be repatriated and may not be deposited abroad; but individuals may retain all or part of such earnings according to prevailing regulations.

Remitted profits are subject to an additional tax of 10 percent, but only if the profits have been generated in areas other than the special economic zones, the 14 selected coastal cities, and the old urban areas of Xiamen, Shantou, and Zhuhai. If a Chinese resident wishes to spend money on travel abroad, receive his pension abroad, or remit money abroad, he must apply to the local SAEC bureau for approval. Such factors as the individual's normal income and expenditure are examined to determine if approval is to be granted for remittances. In cases of serious illness, death, or injury affecting a Chinese resident's parents, spouse, or children outside China, he may be allocated the necessary foreign exchange on presentation of documentary verification. If permission is granted to travel abroad, a Chinese resident is normally allowed to take a reasonable amount of foreign exchange to cover expenses for transport and subsistence; any surplus must be repatriated and surrendered to the Bank of China. There is no tax on travel. A Chinese resident who retires and emigrates is normally permitted to receive his pension abroad, but he is not normally permitted to remit the proceeds from any assets he may sell in China. Foreign exchange remitted or brought in by nonresi- dents may be converted into either Chinese currency or foreign exchange certificates denominated in yuan. Foreign exchange certificates can be used solely by nonresidents in hotels, restaurants, and shops serving nonresidents, for purchasing airline tickets and through train or ship fares to Hong Kong and Macao, and for international telecommunications and parcel post charges. Special regulations apply in Guangdong Prov- ince. Persons entering China must declare their holdings of foreign currency and may take out of China any unused foreign currency on presentation of the import declaration form issued by the customs. The import and export of Chinese bank notes are prohibited. Foreign exchange certificates may be imported, but their export is subject to the provision of documentation showing that they have been acquired legitimately. Chinese residents must show their authorization to export foreign currency at the border. Income from royalties, dividends, interest, and rentals is subject to a 20 percent tax; a preferential rate of 10 percent is applied for foreign and overseas Chinese partners in joint ventures set up in the special economic zones and new technology development areas in the 14 7 Including those employed by enterprises w i th overseas and foreign Chinese capital. PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA coastal cities, as well as in the old urban areas of Xiamen, Shantou, and Zhuhai. Joint ventures are required to be insured with Chinese insurance companies. Capital All units wishing to borrow abroad must prepare a plan showing the kinds of imports for which the loan is intended. Such plans must indicate the total amount of foreign exchange needed, and how much of this will be earned and how much will be borrowed from abroad. All such plans are submitted to the State Planning Commis- sion, which reviews them in cooperation with the SAEC and the MOFERT. Loans for vital projects or projects which have a rapid rate of return are given priority approval. If the imports are for new construction, the plans are also reviewed by the State Economic Commis- sion. Loans from international financial institutions and foreign governments require the sanction of the State Planning Commission and the approval of the State Council. Loans from international development agencies are generally the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance or of the China Investment Bank (an organiza- tion under the direction of the Ministry), while in- tergovernmental loans are the responsibility of the MOFERT. Government departments, local govern- ments, and enterprises are usually required to borrow through the Bank of China or with its guarantee, rather than borrowing directly abroad themselves. There is an annual limit on such borrowing set by the State Planning Commission. Foreign borrowing in the form of deferred payments requires the approval of the MOFERT. Resi- dent organizations may not issue securities for foreign exchange unless approved by the State Council. All foreign direct investment projects are in principle subject to the approval of the MOFERT. However, a number of provincial and local authorities have been granted the authority to approve foreign direct invest- ment projects up to specified amounts. The policy with respect to foreign capital is designed both to make up for the insufficiency of domestic capital and to facilitate the introduction of modern technology and management. Most foreign exchange earned by joint ventures and other enterprises involving nonresident capital must be deposited with the Bank of China or another bank approved by the SAEC; outward transfers of capital generally require SAEC approval. Enterprises involved in the exploitation of offshore petroleum reserves may also hold foreign exchange abroad or in the Hong Kong or Macao regions. When a joint venture is wound up, the net claims belonging to the foreign investor may be remitted with SAEC approval through the foreign ex- change account of the joint venture. Alternatively, the foreign investor may apply for repayment of his paid-in capital. Profits of joint ventures, with the exception of firms in special economic zones, the 14 coastal cities, and the old urban areas of Xiamen, Shantou, and Zhuhai and those 145 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA exploiting petroleum, natural gas, and other specified resources, are subject to tax at 33 percent (30 percent basic rate plus a 10 percent surcharge on the assessed tax). When profits are reinvested in China, 40 percent of the tax paid is eligible for rebate after five years, provided that the joint venture remains in operation at that time. As mentioned above, remitted profits are subject to an additional tax of 10 percent, which is waived if the profits are generated in the special economic zones, the 14 coastal cities and the old urban areas of Xiamen, Shantou, and Zhuhai. A joint venture scheduled to operate for ten years or more may be exempted from income tax in the first one or two profit- making years and be allowed reductions of 50 percent for up to the following three years. Joint ventures in low- profit operations, such as farming and forestry, or located in areas considered to be economically underde- veloped may be allowed a further 15-30 percent reduc- tion in income tax for the following ten years. A participant in a joint venture which reinvests its share of profit in China for a period of not less than five years may obtain a refund of 40 percent of the tax paid on the reinvested profit. Certain joint ventures established before the passing of tax regulations in August 1980 are subject to taxes at different rates. Foreign companies, enterprises, and other economic organizations, which have establishments in China engaged in independent business operation, or cooperative production, or joint business operation with Chinese enterprises are subject to tax on their net income. There are five levels of tax rates, ranging from the lowest of 20 percent for the first Y 250,000 of profits to the highest of 40 percent when profits exceed Y 1 million. In addition, a local income tax of 10 percent of the same taxable income is levied. Income from interest on deposits of foreign banks in China's state banks and on loans given at a normal interest rate by foreign banks to China's state banks is similarly subject to taxation. Foreign banks originating from countries in which income from interest on deposits and loans of China's state banks is exempted from income tax are exempt from this Chinese income tax. For interest income or leasing fees (less than the value of equipment) earned by foreign businessmen under credit agreements, trade agreements, and leasing agreements signed by them with Chinese companies and enterprises during the period 1983-85, income tax is to be levied at the reduced rate of 10 percent (half of the normal rate) during the validity of the aforesaid agreements; interest earnings from export credits are entitled to income tax exemption. For fees collected by foreign businessmen for the use of special technology provided by them in such fields as agriculture, animal husbandry, research, energy, communications, transport, environmental pro- tection, and the development of important techniques, income tax is levied at the reduced rate of 10 percent; fees from the provision of advanced technology at favorable terms are entitled to income tax exemption. Foreign investment by Chinese enterprises is subject to approval; profits thereby earned must be sold to the 146 Bank of China, except for a portion which may be retained locally as working balance. Chinese diplomatic and commercial organizations abroad as well as busi- nesses abroad and in the Hong Kong and Macao regions are required to draw up annual foreign exchange plans. Gold The People's Bank of China buys and sells gold and has central control over dealings in gold and silver. Sales of gold and silver are restricted to pharmaceutical, industrial, and approved uses. Private persons may hold gold but may not trade or deal in it. The amount of gold, gold products, silver, and silver products that may be imported is unlimited but must be declared on entry. When exporting gold or silver, the exporter must present an import document from the customs or a People's Bank of China export permit. Nonresidents may buy gold and silver and gold and silver products at special stores but must present the invoice when exporting them. Changes During January 1, 1984—January 3, 1985 Exchange Arrangement January 1 (1985). The use of the internal settlement rate was discontinued, and it was announced that henceforth all transactions in foreign currencies would be settled at the official exchange rate published by the SAEC. Administration of Control September 19 (1984). The State Council approved a reform of the foreign trade system proposed by the MOFERT, thereby granting authorization for importers and exporters to choose freely their agents among licensed foreign trade entities other than the 14 national foreign trade corporations (NFTCs), except that a few key commodities would continue to be handled by one of the NFTCs. In addition, it was announced that MOFERT would no longer be involved in actual transactions but would concentrate on drawing up overall policies and ensuring implementation of general principles, foreign trade regulations, and policy measures. The NFTCs were expected to become gradually independent of the MOFERT (or provincial and municipal foreign trade departments) and to operate as independent accounting units. (This decision of the State Council reversed a policy of recentralization of foreign trade which had been announced in March 1984.) January 1 (1985). The reform of the foreign trade system announced on September 19, 1984 came into effect. Foreign Currency Accounts July 1 (1984).

Not for Redistribution from customs duties on imports and exports for Chinese and foreign contractual joint ventures. February 4 (1984}. In a simplification of existing procedures, a uniform system of import licensing was introduced. The primary purpose of the new regulations was to pave the way for setting up a regulatory framework whereby the MOFERT would no longer be involved in the direct conduct and management of foreign trade. February 13 (1984). All imports and exports were made subject to prior inspection by relevant authorities before release by the General Administration of Customs. March 29 (1984).

China and the European Com- munity signed a new trade and economic cooperation agreement, superseding a previous trade agreement signed on April 3, 1978. October 1 (1984). China announced its decision to urge the GATT textiles surveillance body to examine the 21 restrictions unilaterally imposed by the United States on imports of textile products from China. October 14 (1984). China and Sweden concluded an agreement on textile products. PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA November 7 (1984). The State Council confirmed that joint ventures set up in the 14 designated coastal cities would be allowed to sell part of their production in domestic markets and that customs duties and the consolidated industrial and commercial tax on exports and on specified imports, including raw materials, would be waived. December 13 (1984). In a move to attract foreign direct investment, the municipal authorities of Shanghai announced new tax and other concessions, including reduced customs duties and preferential access to some domestic markets. Under the concessions, the income tax could be reduced to 15 percent with approval from the Ministry of Finance, and customs duties on certain imported equipment and raw materials would be waived. December 20 (1984). China and the German Demo- cratic Republic signed a new trade and payments agreement for 1985. December 26 (1984). China and the U .S .S .R signed a new trade agreement, under which total trade between the two countries was to amount to the equivalent of Sw F 4.6 billion in 1985, a 73 percent increase over the level in 1984. January 1 (1985). The reform of the foreign trade system announced on September 19, 1984 came into effect. The reform aimed, inter alia, at decentralization of foreign trade, with the MOFERT no longer involved in the daily enterprise management. In addition, w i th effect also from January 1, 1985, exporters would be allowed to retain a higher percentage of their earned foreign exchange. Invisibles March 12 (1984). With effect from April 1, 1985, a patent law was approved by the State Council, under which foreigners and Chinese nationals would be allowed to apply for patents in China and receive equal treatment and protection. March 21 (1984). China and the United States signed an agreement aimed at the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of evasion of income taxes. November 19 (1984). New provisional regulations concerning the application of income taxes and the consolidated industrial and commercial tax in special economic zones and in the new technology development zones in the the 14 newly opened-up coastal cities were issued by the State Council. Under the regulations, the income tax payable by joint ventures in the specified zones and areas would be reduced by 15 percent with the approval of the Ministry of Finance. Income taxes for other long-term industrial, communication, transport, agricultural, and service trade undertakings in their first one or two profit-making years would be waived with the approval of the taxation authority, and reductions of 50 percent would be allowed in the following two or three years, but profits made by the older sectors of the 14 coastal cities would be subject to taxation by up to 80 percent of the standard tax rate of 33 percent. In addition, consolidated industrial and commercial tax 147 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA exemptions would be granted on imports of machinery and equipment, raw materials, bu i ld ing supplies, spare parts and other specified inpu ts, and exports other than those controlled by the State. Foreign participants in joint ventures in these zones and areas were also allowed to remit their share of the profits overseas tax free, but a 10 percent tax was levied on their income from royalties, dividends, interest and rentals, compared with the standard rate elsewhere in China of 20 percent. The exemption and reductions of income tax were made applicable to the whole of 1984, while the exemption and reductions of the consolidated industrial and com- mercial tax were to take effect from December 1, 1984. Capital January 23 (1984). The State Council announced that the Shanghai region would be given the authority to approve foreign direct investment projects to a value of up to US$10 million. April 27 (1984). The State Council announced that 14 selected coastal cities would be allowed to open up further to the outside world, in order to help to speed up the introduction of advanced foreign technologies, not- ably through foreign direct investment. May 3 (1984). The harbor city of Beihai, one of the 14 coastal cities selected by the State Council for wider opening up to the outside world, was officially desig- nated as an economic and technological development zone opened to foreign direct investment by small and medium-size electronics and light industrial enterprises. Foreign nationals investing in Beihai would be given a preferential tax treatment similar to that prevailing in the four special economic zones. June 6 (1984). The municipality of Shanghai an- nounced that foreigners investing in the economic and technological development zone in Shanghai would be given a preferential tax treatment in regard to local income tax, comparable to the tax treatment provided in the Zhenzhen special economic zone. July 14 (1984). As part of various steps announced by the State Council with the objective of speeding up a "wider opening up" of the 14 designated coastal cities to the outside world, it was decided that these cities would not have the status of the existing special economic zones, but would be allowed, at their own initiative, to offer additional tax incentives to foreign investors providing advanced technology. In addition, such cities could set up special economic and technological devel- opment areas where the 10 percent tax on profits remitted abroad by foreign investors would be waived. As in the special economic zones, the profits of joint ventures established in the designated areas would be subject to a 15 percent income tax, and machinery, equipment, and other inputs imported by or for joint ventures operating in the 14 coastal cities would be exempt from customs duties as well as from the consolidated industrial and commercial tax. Exports would also be exempt from export duties; and a certain 148 proportion of products requiring advanced manu fac tu r- ing techniques would be permitted to be marketed domestically. July 31 (1984). Joint ventures operating in the 14 coastal cities were formally made subject to an income tax of only 15 percent (instead of the standard 33 percent), w i th the approval of the Ministry of Finance. In addition, the 10 percent tax on outward remittances of foreign investment income would be waived if the foreign direct investment was undertaken in designated economic and technological development areas in these cities. August 20 (1984). Special foreign currency lending facilities were set up by the Bank of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China for domestic borrowers to help finance imports of advanced foreign technology. September 1 (1984). Authorization was granted for the State Administration of Exchange Control and the Bank of China to settle payments of outstanding foreign currency debts of foreign and overseas Chinese banks in China (including branches undergoing or already in liquidation), which were contracted through 1949. November 7 (1984). The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China was authorized to carry out business transactions in foreign exchange in the special economic zones. November 19 (1984). New provisional regulations concerning the application of income taxes and the consolidated industrial and commercial tax in the special economic zones and in the new technology development zones in the 14 newly opened-up coastal cities were issued by the State Council. Under the regulations, the income tax payable by joint ventures in the specified zones and areas would be reduced from the standard rate of 33 percent to 15 percent, w i th the approval of the Ministry of Finance. Income taxes for other long-term industrial, communication, transport, agricultural, and service trade undertakings in their first one or two profit- making years would be waived w i th the approval of the taxation authority, and reductions of 50 percent would be allowed in the following two or three years, but profits made by the older sectors of the 14 coastal cities would be subject to taxation by up to 80 percent of the standard tax rate of 33 percent. In addition, consolidated indus- trial and commercial tax exemptions would be granted on imports of machinery and equipment, raw materials, building supplies, spare parts and other specified inputs, and exports other than those controlled by the State. Foreign participants in jo int ventures in these zones and areas were also allowed to remit their share of the profits overseas tax free, but a 10 percent tax was levied on income from royalties, dividends, interest, and rentals, compared with the standard rate of 20 percent elsewhere in China. The exemption and reductions of income tax were made applicable to the whole of 1984, while the exemption and reductions of industrial and commercial consolidated tax were to take effect from December 1, 1984. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA December 13 (1984). In a move aimed at attracting foreign direct investment, the municipal authorities of Shanghai announced new concessions on tax and other policies, including reduced customs duties and preferen- tial access to specified domestic markets. In addition, the income tax could, with approval from the Ministry of Finance, be decreased to 15 percent on condition that the projects be operated with advanced technology or that the investments be for over US$30 million, and customs duties on certain imported equipment and raw materials could be waived. December 22 (1984). Foreign banks were allowed to accept deposits from foreign organizations, nonresi- dents, enterprises with foreign capital as well as capital belonging to overseas Chinese, and Chinese and foreign joint ventures, and to make loans in foreign currency in Shanghai. January 3 (1985). New plans to open four large industrialized regions to foreign investment and trade were announced. The move represented the third stage in China's current open-door policy, following experiments in the four special economic zones and the 14 coastal cities. 149 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution COLOMBIA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Colombia is the Colombian Peso. The authorities of Colombia follow a policy of adjusting the peso in small amounts at relatively short intervals, taking into account (1) the movements of prices in Colombia relative to those in its major trading partners; (2) the level of Colombia's foreign exchange reserves; and (3) Colombia's overall balance of payments perfor- mance. Exchange surrender and foreign payments are generally effected through the medium of exchange certificates, which are traded in the official market at the official rate and in the stock exchange at varying rates of discount. In the case of export proceeds, exporters have the option of either immediate conversion or acquisition of exchange certificates with a maturity of 90 days. On December 31, 1984 the buying and selling rates in the official market for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, were Col$113.89 and Col$114.34, respec- tively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates for certain other currencies1 are also officially quoted, with daily quotations based on the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar in markets abroad. All exchange transactions are effected through the Bank of the Republic (the central bank) or authorized banks. There are other effective exchange rates which result from (1) a 6.5 percent tax on coffee export proceeds; (2) tax credit certificates granted at five different percen- tage rates for most export proceeds; (3) the imposition of a remittance tax at two different rates on certain service payments; (4) an advance deposit of Col$65 per US$1 on the purchase of foreign exchange for travel purposes; and (5) a 95 percent advance exchange license deposit for import payments. The peso equivalent of the Govern- ment's exchange receipts from the export tax on coffee is credited to the Treasury's Special Exchange Account at an accounting rate applied by the Bank of the Republic; the Government purchases exchange for all public debt payments and other expenditures included in the national budget at the same exchange rate. The Bank of the Republic stands ready to sell exchange warrants (titulos canjeables por certificados de cambio) to government enterprises in the oil sector and to public sector recipients of external loans, against payment in pesos at the certificate market selling rate on the date of issue. These warrants, which are expressed in U .S. dollars and have a maturity of 24 months are nego- tiable and may also be exchanged for exchange certifi- cates, provided that the holder presents an exchange license. Within their period of validity, warrants may also be sold to the Bank of the Republic for pesos, at the Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. 150 certificate market buying rate on the date of repurchase. Warrants bear interest at 1.5 points above the New York prime rate, if held by government enterprises in the oil sector, or an interest rate equal to that of the external loan but never higher than 11 percent or lower than 7 percent, if held by public sector recipients of external loans. Warrants held longer than 24 months cannot be converted into exchange certificates but may be resold to the Bank at the certificate market rate on the last day of the twenty-fourth month. Administration of Control All imports and exports require prior registration at the Colombian Institute of Foreign Trade (INCOMEX). Ex- change for payments must be purchased through the Bank of the Republic or the commercial banks, with an approved exchange license issued by the Exchange Office of the Bank of the Republic; however, payments for specified current transactions, when made through credit institutions, do not require prior exchange licenses but must be submitted to the Bank of the Republic for ex post authentication. All payments for study purposes require prior authorization by the Colombian Institute for International Education (ICETEX). The Monetary Board is authorized periodically to draw up a foreign exchange budget and it did so in 1984. It can also establish priorities within that budget for the delivery of exchange, after setting aside the amounts necessary to cover the obligations of the Bank of the Republic and to service the external debt of the public agencies and the National Federation of Coffee Growers. The Foreign Trade Council (FTC), which includes representatives of the Ministry of Finance, INCOMEX, and other public entities, determines overall import and export policy and assigns foreign exchange for imports in the following order of priority: (1) raw materials and spare parts; (2) imports of El Cerrejon coal project; (3) public sector imports of agricultural products; (4) fuel imports; (5) capital goods imports for export industries; and (6) other imports. A joint Trade Commission (Comision Mixta de Comercio Exterior) with representatives from the Ministry of Finance, INCOMEX, and the private sector serves as an advisory committee on foreign trade. INCOMEX, through its Import Board, controls those imports that are subject to prior licensing, administers special import-export arrangements in the form of barter, clearing and triangu- lar trade operations, and also sets maximum import prices for certain commodities. The National Council for Economic and Social Policy issues directives concerning direct investment in Colombia to the Exchange Office and the National Planning Department. The Exchange Office keeps an accounting record both of foreign investment in Colombia and of debts abroad and controls the movement of foreign capital as well as the transfer of profits, dividends, commissions, and royalties for ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution trademarks, patents, etc. The sale of proceeds from certain current invisibles is also subject to prior registra- tion with the Exchange Office. The Superintendency of Exchange Control, which is an autonomous agency reporting to the Presidency of the Republic, enforces the control and supervision over exchange transactions and is responsible for applying penalties for any violation of the exchange regulations. Prescription of Currency The Monetary Board establishes the list of currencies which it accepts for exchange surrender and provides for import payments. Payments and receipts are normally effected in U.S. dollars, but importers and exporters are also free to use quoted currencies (see footnote 1). Settlements for commercial transactions with countries with which Colombia has bilateral payments or recip- rocal credit agreements2 must be made through special accounts in accordance with the provisions of the particular bilateral payments agreement. Settlements between Colombia and Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela are made through accounts maintained within the framework of the multilateral clearing system of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA). There are also reciprocal credit agreements with Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Spain, the U .S .S .R ., and member countries of the Central American Common Market (CACM). Nonresident Accounts Credit institutions are authorized to receive short-term deposits in foreign currency from physical or juridical persons not resident in Colombia; these deposits are freely available to the holders, but any foreign currency deposits that they may wish to convert into Colombian currency must be sold to the Bank of the Republic. Before releasing the accounts of nonresidents, banks must obtain authorization from the Exchange Office. Imports and Import Payments Imports are subject to one of the following regimes: (1) freely importable goods, requiring only registration with INCOMEX; (2) goods subject to prior approval and requiring an import license; (3) goods included in the prohibited import list; and (4) goods requiring special import-export arrangements for their importation. In the free-import regime, there is a global free list applicable to all countries, a National List applicable only to member countries of the LAI A, and special lists applica- ble only to less developed member countries of the LAIA and to members of the Andean Pact. Operations under special import-export arrangements in the form of barter, clearing, and triangular trade arrangements are required to take place in accordance with the relevant regulations issued by the Monetary Board in the event that they give 2Colombia maintains bilateral payments agreements with Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia. COLOMBIA rise to a request for foreign exchange or to an obligation to surrender foreign exchange. These arrangements involve payments in foreign currency in the case when the Colombian importer and the Colombian exporter are not the same juridical entity and, in addition, the import operation is not followed by the export operation contemplated in the arrangement because of noncom- pliance on the part of the exporter. In such cases, INCOMEX designates a "responsible party" which is requested to provide the value of the import in pesos plus a peso-denominated fine. Similarly, the exporter partici- pating in barter arrangement is requested to surrender the foreign exchange earned in the case when the export operation precedes the import operation and the importer fails to comply with the terms of the arrangement. INCOMEX encourages special import-export operations with a view to promote exports which would not be carried out otherwise through other foreign trade mecha- nisms . The barter trade system is currently required for a relatively small set of commodities, including wine and spirits, typewriters, computers, tractors, vans, and pho- tographic equipment. A distinction is drawn between reimbursable and nonreimbursable imports. The term reimbursable im- ports covers imports that involve purchase of official foreign exchange, including imports of machinery and equipment, financed by international credit institutions. Nonreimbursable imports consist mainly of aid imports under grants and commodities constituting part of a direct investment. All import registrations by public sector agencies are screened by INCOMEX to determine whether local substitutes are available. Import licenses for certain items are normally not issued; these include arms and habit-forming drugs, certain foodstuffs, certain textiles and clothing, and jewelry. Both import licenses and registrations are valid for six months, except for imports of agricultural and livestock products, for which the validity period is three months. Import licenses can be extended for successive three-month periods, whereas registrations of free imports can be extended for only two successive three-month periods. All imports other than those classified as "minor imports" or shipments with an f .o .b. value of less than US$500 are subject to registra- tion with INCOMEX. Urgently needed spare parts not exceeding US$10,000 are also classified as minor imports and are not subject to registration. The charge for import registration is Col$ 1,500. There is an advance exchange license deposit (consignation) which has to be lodged at the official rate for exchange certificates at least 20 calendar days prior to applying for an exchange license. The rate of deposit is 95 percent of the value of the exchange license. Import duties are calculated at the "Ministry of Finance exchange rate" (the average selling rate for exchange certificates for the previous month, as deter- mined by the Ministry of Finance). In addition to customs duties, there is an ad valorem tax on imports equal to 5 percent of the c . i .f. value, the proceeds of which go to the Export Promotion Fund. Exempt from 151 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution COLOMBIA this tax are temporary imports; imports by public entities; goods of LAIA origin; imports under the Vallejo Plan; diplomatic, consular, and similar imports; gifts; and imports destined for CORFERIAS (International Com- merce Fair of Bogota) for the free port of San Andres y Providencia or effected through the Port of Leticia. With the above exemptions, imports are also subject to a tax of 1.5 percent of the c.i.f. value, the proceeds of which accrue to the ordinary budget of the National Govern- ment. All imports (except newsprint) are subject to a stamp tax of 1 percent of the f .o .b. value. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles are made at the exchange certificate rate. To obtain exchange licenses for freight payments, a freight company must, either directly or through agents in Colombia, lodge a deposit amounting to 95 percent of payment value. Payments for more than 80 percent of total import or export freight are allowed only if it can be established that freight cost payable in local currency amounted to less than 20 percent of total cost. Services may be imported through special import- export arrangements in the form of baiter, clearing, and triangular trade arrangements. Most payments for invisibles, including banking commissions, international air travel, and expenses incurred in the export of noncoffee products, are subject to exchange licenses. Banks may transfer without prior approval payments for certain other current invisibles, including interest on suppliers' credit, medical expenses, support of technical staff abroad, the monthly allow- ances of students studying abroad with government support, and for the service of registered foreign loans taken up by the private sector. Foreign exchange purchases for foreign travel are limited to the equivalent of US$90 a day, up to US$1,500 a year for those under 12 years of age, US$180 a day, up to US$3,000 a year an adult, and up to US$200 a day, within a limit of US$10,000 a year for "special" travelers, defined as those traveling for reasons that are of particular useful- ness in the economic and social development of the country. In addition, a prior deposit of Col$65 per US$1 must be lodged with the Bank of the Republic, refund- able within six months upon submission of evidence of amounts actually spent, together with travel documents. Remittances abroad for study purposes are subject to the following limits: (1) US$300 for travel; (2) US$400 for books and study material; (3) US$400 to cover thesis fees; (4) up to US$500 monthly for living expenses; (5) up to US$250 monthly for expenses incurred by a spouse if coursework extends beyond six months; and (6) a once-and-for-all US$500 allowance for unforeseen expenditures. Registration fees for courses approved by ICETEX, as well as health and accident insurance for students, are not subject to limits. Requests for foreign exchange for study purposes have to be approved by ICETEX. The transfer of profits accruing to foreign investors is limited to 20 percent of the capital base a year. Profits beyond such limit may count toward 152 increasing the capital base up to a yearly maximum of 7 percent of registered capital and only whenever at least 50 percent of the amount is reinvested in bonds issued by the Industrial Promotion Institute or in new enterprises satisfying the following criteria: (1) at least 80 percent of their production is exported; and (2) at least 40 percent of their financing is in the form of direct foreign investment and/or foreign medium- and long-term loans. These limitations do not hold for multinational enterprises in which at least 80 percent of the capital is held by investors in the countries of the Andean Pact; in such cases, profits can be reinvested and transferred freely. Foreign tourists who have stayed in Colombia for a period not exceeding three months may, on leaving the country, purchase foreign currency of up to US$100 on presentation of their passports. A remittance tax of 12 percent is applicable to a number of current payments; for profits transferred by branches of foreign companies, the tax is 20 percent. Colombian nationals and resident foreigners are re- quired to pay a travel tax of US$15 whenever they leave the country. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of crude oil and certain other commodities are prohibited, and exports of certain foodstuffs are subject to quotas. Exports of certain other items, such as beef, are reserved for the Institute de Mercado Agropecuario (IDEMA). No export licenses are required, but prior application for registration is necessary for all exports except samples and Colombian products in noncommer- cial quantities. When registering an export transaction, exporters must provide INCOMEX with either a personal guarantee in pesos (but without depositing any funds) or a bank guarantee corresponding to 5 percent of the registered amount, calculated at the Ministry of Finance exchange rate. The periods for surrendering export proceeds normally are as follows: (1) for coffee, within 20 days from the date of registration of the export (180 days for instant coffee); and (2) for other goods, generally within five months of registration. However, longer time periods for the surrender of proceeds are permitted for exports to Chile, Peru, Ecuador, and Venezuela, goods sold on a commission basis, books, magazines, and other printed matter (18 months), capital goods (2 years), and other goods that normally require more extended payment terms. The Bank of the Republic is empowered in certain cases to retain a portion of the exchange proceeds surrendered by the exporter of any product to repay debts for imports under the Vallejo Plan. All exchange proceeds from exports must be surrendered to the Bank of the Republic, with the exception of export proceeds of the Empresa Colombiana de Petroleo (ECOPETROL) and exports of minerals associated with state enterprises, which are permitted to retain part of their export proceeds abroad for the settlement of their import costs. On surrendering their export proceeds to the Bank of the Republic, exporters of commodities other than ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution coffee, raw cattle hides, or petroleum and petroleum products receive tax credit certificates (Certificados de Reembolso Tributario, or CERTs) in an amount corre- sponding to a specified percentage of the total earnings surrendered, converted at the Ministry of Finance ex- change rate. This rate ranges from 5 percent to 35 percent depending on the commodity and the country of destination; the rates are calculated on domestic value added for specified assembly operations. These certifi- cates, which are freely negotiable and are quoted on the stock exchange, are accepted at par by tax offices for the payment of income tax, customs duties, and sales taxes. The surrender of foreign currency earned by exporters can, as an option, be effected by exchanging the foreign currency for exchange certificates (of 90 days' maturity) that are negotiable on the stock exchange. M in imum surrender prices for coffee, bananas, and a few other exports are set from time to time by the Monetary Board. Exports of coffee are subject to the following regulations: (1) A minimum surrender price (reintegro) is fixed after deduction for freight and insurance at US$201.40 a 70-kilogram bag. (2) Export- ers pay a tax in foreign exchange at the rate of 6.5 percent ad valorem. Of this tax, 3.2 percentage points are paid to the National Coffee Fund, and 0.8 percentage points are paid to the Departmental Committees of Coffee Growers, while the remainder provides revenue for the Treasury's Special Exchange Account. (3) Exporters must either surrender without payment (in the form of untreated coffee) the equivalent of 68 percent of the volume of excelso coffee that they wish to export (retencion cafeterd) or pay the National Federation of Coffee Growers the peso equivalent. (4) Exports of coffee are subject to an additional tax of 6 percent ad valorem (pasilla y ripio tax); the tax must be paid to the Federation either in kind or in pesos. (5) A committee composed of the Ministers of Finance and Agriculture and the Managing Director of the Federation establishes a domestic buying price for export-type coffee, expressed in pesos per carga of 125 kilograms. Proceeds from Invisibles All exchange receipts from invisibles must be surren- dered; they are converted against exchange certificates which can be sold on the stock exchange. For surrenders in respect of gifts and the rendering of professional services other than medical, hospital, or educational services, prior authorization from the Exchange Office is required. Capital All inward and outward capital transfers are effected at the certificate market rate. There is a 95 percent advance payment deposit on all outflows, which must be lodged prior to applying for an exchange license. All foreign investment in Colombia, all new foreign loans, direct lines of foreign credit obtained by nonbank COLOMBIA residents,3 and the movement of capital previously imported (except loans previously registered under De- cree No. 2322 of September 2, 1965) must be registered with the Exchange Office. Direct foreign investment regulations in Colombia are in accordance with the provisions of Decisions Nos. 24 and 103 of the Cartagena Agreement which govern foreign investment within the member countries of the Andean Pact. The National Council for Economic and Social Planning (CONPES) can legislate special conditions affecting foreign investment so as to overrule the above- mentioned provisions. Foreign investment is required to become 51 percent Colombian-owned by the fifteenth year after its registration, with the exception of invest- ment in enterprises that satisfy one of the following conditions: (i) at least 25 percent of their production is exported; or (ii) at least 50 percent of their material inputs are of Colombian origin. Member countries of the Andean Pact are treated as Colombian investors for purposes of fulfilling the Colombian ownership require- ment provided that profit and capital remittances remain within the country of origin and shares are not sold outside the area. Capital invested in the petroleum industry is subject to special rules and provisions. Capital imports require prior approval by the National Planning Department, with the exception of capital for the petroleum industry which requires approval by the Ministry of Mines and Energy, and capital for mineral exploration other than petroleum, which requires ap- proval by both the National Planning Department and the Ministry of Mines. All foreign banks and their branches must have Colombian majority participation. New for- eign direct investment in banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions is restricted to investors from member countries of the Andean Pact and to national or mixed companies on the basis of reciprocal treatment. The purchase of 10 percent or more of the shares of a Colombian financial institution requires the prior approval of the Banking Superintendent. Capital registration entitles the investor to export profits and to repatriate capital at the certificate market rate on certain conditions specified in Decree No. 1900 of Septem- ber 15, 1973. The transfer of profits is limited to 20 percent of registered direct investment with certain exceptions (see section on Payments for Invisibles); where the profits were earned (and not remitted) prior to the coming into force of Decree-Law No. 444 of 1967, the additional remittances must not exceed 3 percent a year. Special legal regimes exist for direct foreign investment in the nickel, coal, and uranium sectors that waive the 20 percent limit on the transfer of profits abroad. A special regime also applies to a total of 3 Loans by financial entities for the import of goods also require registration; their repayment is authorized by the exchange license covering the relevant import transaction. Such loans are subject to an interest rate ceiling of 2.5 percent over the New York prime rate or the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR). 153 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution COLOMBIA 34 different industrial activities, including fishing, food products, leather products, chemicals, iron and steel, machine tools, engines, specialized machinery, ship- building, automobiles, the aeronautic industry, and photographic equipment, as well as to enterprises export- ing at least 50 percent of their output. This regime allows remittances in a percentage of dollar-denominated capi- tal, determined by adding 20 points to the average New York prime interest rate prevailing in the year of registration of the foreign investment transaction, as estimated by the Bank of the Republic. Other special regimes are applicable to (1) the earthquake-hit area of Popayan, which allow profit remittances on invested capital in a percentage equivalent to 25 percent above the average New York prime interest rate in the year of registration of the capital inflows; and to (2) bordering regions, which allow transfer of profits up to 24 percent of the dollar-denominated investment. Foreign loans contracted by private Colombian indi- viduals or firms are generally subject to a minimum maturity of three years with one year of grace and to an interest rate ceiling of 2.5 percent over the New York prime rate or LIB OR. Such loans normally are permitted only for financing working capital or fixed investment. Special regulations govern the periods for which resident banks may provide import financing from foreign cur- rency borrowed abroad. Foreign loans for national or governmental entities in excess of Col$10 million or US$500,000 require prior authorization by the Ministry of Finance and the National Planning Department. For loans to the Government, or guaranteed by the Govern- ment, the following are also required: prior authorization by the National Council for Economic and Social Policy and by the Monetary Board, prior consultation with the Interparliamentary Committee on Public Credit, and ex post approval by the President of the Republic. Contracts involving royalties, commissions, trade- marks or patents, and similar arrangements must be registered with the Exchange Office to enable the beneficiary to make transfers abroad and they require approval by the Royalties Committee before they can be registered. Colombian nationals who have invested abroad must surrender to the Bank of the Republic, against exchange certificates, not only the interest, profits, commissions, and royalties but also the proceeds of the sale or liquidation of the investment. Export of capital by residents is restricted, and such export by private individuals is not normally permitted. Current deposit accounts in foreign currency may be held by insurance companies, export firms, transporta- tion companies, and other specified entities, upon prior authorization of the Bank of the Republic. A ceiling equivalent to 5 percent of their total foreign liabilities is applied on the foreign currency deposits which may be held by domestic financial institutions. Gold Natural and juridical persons may trade in Colombia 154 in gold coins for numismatic purposes only. With this exception, only the Bank of the Republic is entitled to purchase, sell, hold, import, or export gold. Imports of nonmonetary gold are not normally undertaken. The Bank of the Republic purchases locally produced gold at the average price prevailing in the London and Zurich markets during the preceding week, plus a subsidy of 30 percent on the indicated average price. The Bank of the Republic levies an ad valorem tax of 2 percent on the total payment received by the miner. The Bank of the Republic makes domestic sales of gold for industrial use directly at a price equivalent to the average quotation in gold markets abroad during the previous day; this price is converted into pesos at the prevailing selling rate of exchange certificates on the date of sale. The assay and refining houses and the mining compa- nies producing gold are under the supervision of the Superintendency of Exchange Control. In addition, the mining companies and traders must obtain a license from the Superintendency in order to carry on their operations. The Bank of the Republic from time to time strikes commemorative gold coins, which are legal tender. Residents and nonresidents may freely buy such coins, but export licenses are not normally granted. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement March 7. The Bank of the Republic was authorized to sell to government enterprises in the oil sector exchange warrants with a maturity of up to 24 months and bearing an interest rate of 11 percent. March 28.

Under this scheme, the private sector would convert its foreign obligations into a peso-denominated liability to a domestic commer- cial bank. The peso liability would have a six-year maturity and no grace period, and payments made thereon would be intermediated by the commercial banks to the Bank of the Republic. The Bank of the Republic would in turn provide foreign exchange to the domestic commercial bank according to the rescheduled maturities on the foreign loan. Should the schedule result at the end of the six-year period in higher payments than receipts for the Bank of the Republic on any one of these operations, the balance would be converted into a three- year loan on the same terms as those foreseen in the extended plan. June 14. Authorization was granted for profits beyond the 20 percent limit on outward remittances to be counted toward increasing the foreign investment capital base if invested in new enterprises satisfying the follow- ing criteria: (1) at least 80 percent of production should be exported, and (2) at least 40 percent of financing should be in the form of direct foreign investment or medium- and long-term external borrowing. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution COMOROS (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Comoros is the Comorian Franc (CF), which is pegged to the French franc, the interven- tion currency, at the fixed rate of CF 1 = F 0.02. The current buying and selling rates for the French franc are CF 50 = F 1. Exchange rates for other currenciesl are also officially quoted on the basis of the fixed rate of the Comorian franc for the French franc and the Paris exchange market rate for the respective currencies in terms of the French franc. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of those relating to gold, the exchange control measures of the Comoros do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Ter- ritories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose institute of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Congo, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Central Bank of Comoros. The Ministry of Finance and Economy supervises borrowing and lending abroad, inward direct investment, and all outward investments. Part of the approval authority in respect of exchange control has been delegated to an authorized bank —the sole commer- cial bank —and to the Postal Administration. All ex- change transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through the authorized bank or the Postal Administration. Import and export licenses are issued by the Directorate-General of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance and Economy. Prescription of Currency The Central Bank of Comoros maintains an Opera- tions Account with the French Treasury; settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are made in Comorian francs, French francs, or the currency of any other Operations Account country. Settlements with all other countries are usually made through correspondent banks in France, in any of the currencies of those countries, or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. All settlements with South Africa are prohibited. Imports and Import Payments Imports of South African origin are prohibited, and the import of certain other goods is prohibited from all Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, deutsche mark, Hong Kong dollars, Kenya shillings, Mauritian rupees, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, South African rand, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, Tunisian dinars, and U.S. dollars. countries. The import from any source of certain other commodities is subject to individual licensing. All import transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with the authorized bank if the value is CF 500,000 or more. Payments for Invisibles All payments to South Africa are prohibited. Pay- ments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are permitted freely. Those to other countries are subject to approval; with the exception of travel, for which there are maximum allocations, such approvals are generally given liberally. For tourist travel, residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may obtain up to CF 250,000 in foreign currency a person a trip. The maximum that may be allocated in bank notes is CF 125,000; the remainder may be in the form of a bank transfer, traveler's checks, a certified check, or any other means of payment. For business travel, a special allocation may be authorized by the Central Bank of Comoros upon the request of the authorized bank. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. With a few exceptions, exports to France, Monaco, and the Opera-" tions Account countries are free of license. Most exports to other countries require licenses. Proceeds from ex- ports to foreign countries must normally be collected, and the receipts repatriated within 30 days of the expiration of the commercial contract and sold im- mediately to the authorized bank. All export transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with the authorized bank if the value is CF 500,000 or more. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Ac- count countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be collected and, if received in foreign currency, be surrendered within one month of the due date or the date of receipt. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of domestic and foreign bank notes and coin. Capital All settlements between the Comoros and South Africa are prohibited.

Not for Redistribution PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the People's Republic of the Congo is the CFA Franc,1 which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. Exchange transactions in French francs between the BEAC and commercial banks take place at the rate of CFAF 50 = F 1. Buying and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also officially posted, with quotations based on the fixed rate for the French franc and the rates for the currencies concerned in the Paris exchange market. Payments to France and its Overseas Departments and Territories, Monaco, and the Operations Account coun- tries (see section on Administration of Control, below), as well as the purchase of those countries' bank notes and traveler's checks, are subject to a commission of 0.75 percent, with a minimum charge of CFAF 75; exempt from this commission are payments of the State, the Postal Administration, and the BEAC, salaries of Congolese diplomats abroad, expenditures of official missions abroad, scholarships of persons studying or training abroad, and debt service payments due from companies that have entered into an agreement with the Congo. Most payments to other foreign countries and credits to Foreign Accounts in Francs are subject to a commission of 1 percent or, for foreign exchange purchased by the Diamond Purchase Office, 0.50 per- cent; these commissions are subject to a minimum of CFAF 100. A commission of 0.25 percent is levied on all capital transfers to countries that are not members of the BEAC. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Payments to the following countries, although subject to declaration, are unrestricted: (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Settlements and investment transac- tions with all foreign countries, however, are subject to control. Foreign countries are defined as all countries other than the Congo. The Office of External Financial Relations in the Ministry of Finance supervises borrowing and lending abroad. Exchange control is administered by the Minis- ter of Finance, who has delegated his approval authority to the Office of External Financial Relations. All exchange transactions must be effected through autho- rized banks or the Postal Administration. Import and export licenses are issued by the Foreign Trade Office in the Ministry of Commerce, except those for gold, which are granted by the Office of External Financial Relations. Prescription of Currency Since the Congo is an Operations Account country, settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury. Settlements with the People's Republic of China are made through special accounts established under a bilateral payments agreement.2 Settlements with all other countries are usually made in any of the currencies of those countries or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. The crediting of BEAC bank notes to Foreign Accounts in Francs is permitted when they have been mailed to the BEAC agency in Brazzaville by the foreign correspondent of an autho- rized bank. Imports and Import Payments Imports from all sources require prior authorization. There is an indicative annual import program which distinguishes five zones: (1) the countries of the Central African Customs and Economic Union (UDEAC); (2) France; (3) other countries of the French Franc Area; (4) EC countries other than France; and (5) all remaining countries. All imports under this program require licenses. The import program does not include petroleum imports, for which a joint quota is set for the countries of the UDEAC. Also outside the program are imports for the Government under foreign aid and bilateral payments agreements, and imports made by the Office National du Commerce (OFNACOM), which has a monopoly over imports of frozen and canned meat and frozen chicken. The quotas for non-EC countries may be used to import goods originating in any country outside the French Franc Area.

Licenses for imports from countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries must be domiciled w i th an authorized 1 The CFA franc circulating in the Congo is issued by the Banque des Etats de I'Afr ique Centrale (BEAC) and is legal tender also in Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, and Gabon. 2 There are inoperative payments agreements w i th Bulgaria and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 159 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO bank. Licenses for imports from countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries require the visa of the Foreign Trade Bureau and the Office of External Financial Relations. The approved import license entitles importers to pur- chase the necessary exchange, provided that the shipping documents are submitted to an authorized bank. All imports must be insured with the state insurance company, Societe d'Assurances et de Reassurances du Congo (SARC). To implement this measure, the Con- golese Customs Service releases imports only after an insurance certificate issued by the SARC has been produced. There has been some accumulation of arrears on external payments owing to the imposition of statutory ceilings on central bank credit to the Government and an ensuing shortage of domestic currency with which to purchase foreign exchange. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are permitted freely, provided they have been declared and are made through an authorized intermediary; those to other foreign countries are subject to approval. For many types of payment the approval authority has been delegated to authorized banks. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresi- dents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted freely when the basic transaction has been approved.

For business travel, there is a special allocation of the equivalent of CFAF 20,000 a person a day, subject to a maximum of CFAF 400,000 a trip; additional amounts may be authorized in appropriate cases. The use of credit cards abroad by residents is prohibited. There are special facilities for travelers to Kinshasa who request no foreign means of payment other than Zairian bank notes.

The transfer of the entire net salary of a foreigner working in the Congo is permitted upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher, provided that the transfer takes place within three months of the pay period. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports require prior authorization. Most exports to countries in the French Franc Area may be made freely; among the exceptions are commodities exported by the National Marketing Office for Agricultural Prod- ucts (Office National de Commercialisation des Produits Agricoles) and by the National Marketing Office for Timber (Office Congolais du Bois). Proceeds from exports to foreign countries must be collected and repatriated, generally within 180 days of arrival of the commodities at their destination. Export proceeds must be surrendered within a month of the due date. All export transactions relating to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Proceeds from Invisibles All amounts due from residents of foreign countries in respect of services and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be collected when due and surrendered within a month of the due date. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BEAC, the Bank of France, or any other bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin). Capital Capital movements between the Congo and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are free, though ex post declarations are required. Such movements to countries that are not members of the BEAC are subject to a commission of 0.25 percent. Most international capital transactions are subject to prior authorization. Capital transfers abroad require exchange control approval and are restricted, but capital receipts from abroad generally are permitted freely. All foreign securities, foreign currency, and titles embodying claims on foreign countries or nonresidents that are held in the Congo by residents or nonresidents must be deposited with authorized banks in the Congo. Special controls (additional to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable) are maintained over borrowing and lending abroad, over inward and outward direct investment, and over the issuing, adver- tising, and offering for sale of foreign securities in the Congo; these controls relate to the transactions them- selves, not to payments or receipts. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Direct investments abroad3 require the prior approval of the Minister of Finance; the fu ll or partial liquidation of such investments also requires the prior approval of the Minister. Foreign direct investments in the Congo4 require prior approval by the Minister of Finance, unless they involve the creation of a mixed-economy enterprise. The full or partial liquidation of direct investments in the Congo must be declared to the Minister. Both the making and the liquidation of direct investments, whether these are Congolese investments abroad or foreign investments in the Congo, must be reported to the Minister within 20 days. Direct investments are defined as investments implying control of a company or enterprise. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in the Congo requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. Exempt from authorization, however, are operations in connection with (1) borrow- ing backed by a guarantee from the Congolese Govern- ment and (2) shares similar to securities whose issue, advertising, or offering for sale in the Congo has already been authorized. Borrowing by residents from nonresidents requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. However, loans contracted by registered banks and small loans, where the total amount outstanding does not exceed CFAF 10 million for any one borrower, are exempt from this requirement. The contracting of loans that are free of authorization, and each repayment thereon, must be reported to the Office of External Financial Relations within 20 days of the operation.

The making of loans that are free of authorization, and each repayment thereon, must be reported to the Office of External Financial Relations within 20 days. Under the Investment Code of April 26, 1973, a number of privileges may be granted to approved foreign investments. The Code provides for four categories of preferential treatment. Gold By virtue of Decree No. 66/236 of Ju ly 29, 1966, as amended by Decree No. 66/265 of August 29, 1966, residents are free to hold gold in the form of coin, art objects, or jewelry; however, to hold gold in any other form or to import or export gold in any form, from or to any other country, the prior authorization of the Minister of Finance is required. Exempt from the latter require- ment are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the Treasury or the BE AC, and (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles). Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. There are no official exports of gold. Changes During 1984 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 161 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution COSTA RICA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Costa Rica is the Costa Rican Colon. Costa Rica maintains a unified exchange market in which all transactions other than the surrender of 1 percent of export proceeds take place at $ 47.50 = US$1 buying and <£ 48.00 = US$1 selling. Export proceeds are converted at a mixed exchange rate com- posed of 0.2 percent at the official rate of <£ 20 = US$1 and 99.8 percent at the banking rate of <£ 47.50 = US$1.l The spread between the buying and selling rates in the banking exchange market is legally set at (£ 0.50. Purchases and sales of other Central American curren- cies are effected on the basis of quotations in colones, taking into account the value of those currencies in terms of U .S. dollars in the parallel exchange markets of the respective countries. Costa Rica formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agree- ment, as from February 1, 1965. Administration of Control Exchange controls are operated by the Central Bank. The only institutions authorized to deal with foreign exchange transactions are the Central Bank of Costa Rica, the state commercial banks, and certain private banks authorized by the Central Bank. Prescription of Currency In practice, nearly all exchange transactions in Costa Rica are expressed in U .S. dollars. Following the exchange measures introduced in December 1980, pay- ments to other member countries of the Central Ameri- can Common Market (CACM) in respect of trade and trade-related invisibles continue to be made in Costa Rican colones through the Central American Clearing House, but are made by means of checks and drafts denominated in U .S. dollars and drawn on Costa Rican banks. Payments to and from Colombia in respect of commercial operations, services, and capital may be made in U .S. dollars through a reciprocal credit ar- rangement between the member central banks of the Central American Clearing House and the Bank of the Republic of Colombia. Payments to Mexico in respect of trade, invisibles, and capital may also be made in U.S. dollars under an agreement between the member central banks of the Central American Clearing House and the Bank of Mexico. Imports and Import Payments There is no import licensing, and all import payments may be made freely, subject to submission of evidence 'Ow ing to the long-term nature of the financing obtained for selected imports prior to their transfer from the official to the banking market, sporadic payments still take place at the official rate as those debts are settled. 162 of prior registration (see below), except for goods originating in CACM countries or Panama. Imports made on a barter basis require a barter license (licencia de trueque) issued by the Ministry of Economy and Commerce. To be eligible for foreign exchange, orders for imports valued at over US$500 must be registered with the Central Bank upon confirmation by the foreign supplier, unless the goods originate in CACM countries or Panama. Imports from South Africa are prohibited. In addition to any applicable customs duty, the following taxes are levied on imports (1) a stamp tax of 3 percent of the customs duty; (2) a sales tax of 10 percent ad valorem, from which certain essential items are exempt; and (3) a selective consumption tax at rates of 10 percent, 12 percent, 50 percent, and 75 percent, depending on the considered degree of essentiality. In addition, other levies are imposed as follows: a 2 percent surcharge on capital and consumer goods originating in Central America and Panama, as well as on construction materials; a 10 percent surcharge on capital goods coming from outside Central America, vehicles with an engine displacement of less than 1,250 cubic centimeters (or of greater displacement if they are for commercial use and have a load capacity of more than 2 tons); a 12.5 percent surcharge for consumer goods originating outside Central America; and a 200 percent surcharge on all other types of vehicles not included in the 10 percent category. There is also a small consular tax on certain imports. Under the provisions of the Central American Agree- ment on Fiscal Incentives, Costa Rica grants duty exonerations on imports of raw materials and capital goods to approved industrial firms. Payments for Invisibles Withholding taxes of 15 percent and 10 percent, respectively, are levied on remittances abroad of divi- dends and interest; interest on certain borrowing abroad (e.g., from government banks) is exempt. Costa Rican nationals and resident foreigners traveling abroad by air, sea, or land must pay a travel exit tax in colones equivalent to US$10; Costa Rican nationals who reside abroad must pay, in addition, a consular fee of US$20 upon renewal of their passports abroad. For residents covered by Law No. 4812 (pensionados rentistas) and residents not so covered, the payment differs from the national one. Costa Rican diplomats and certain Peace Corps officials pay an exit fee of only (£ 6, provided their passport states that they are exempt from the above charges. Civil servants and students are not exempt from these payments unless so determined by the Ministry of Finance or the Migration Council. Costa Rican minors are subject to all the above payments, except for dependents of diplomatic parents, who pay only the <£ 6 exit fee. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Commercial banks dealing in the unified market may sell foreign exchange —without prior authorization of the Central Bank —in the following amounts: (a) for foreign travel, a limit of US$100 a day up to a maximum of US$800 a traveler (upon presentation of passport and travel tickets, commercial banks are authorized to sell the equivalent of this amount in the currency of a Central American country to travelers to Central American countries other than Panama); (b) for family remittances, up to US$500 a month a person to a maximum of US$1,000 a family; and (c) for unregistered students, a maximum of US$500 a month for living expenses, in addition to tuition, textbooks, and insurance upon presentation of documents. Remittances to students pursuing higher education abroad are not eligible in the official market. Subject to the approval by the Central Bank, these limits may be exceeded where justified by evidence of a bona fide current expenditures for the specified purpose. Prior authorization by the Central Bank is also required for any foreign exchange purchases for the servicing of private foreign debt, foreign payment of dividends, royalties, patent rights, and professional services. Exports and Export Proceeds The Central Bank supervises exports to ensure that exchange proceeds are surrendered to the banking system; the latter sell to the Central Bank all of their purchases (0.2 percent of export proceeds at the official rate and 99.8 percent at the banking rate). Exporters of nontraditional commodities to markets outside Central America are entitled to tax credit certificates (CATs, which are freely negotiable) corresponding to 15 percent of the f .o .b. value. In addition, exporters of nontradi- tional commodities eligible for CATs may also receive certificates for increases in exports (CIEX) for 1- 10 percent of the increase in the f .o .b. value of exports over the preceding calendar year; the certificates are redeemable against cash at the Central Bank. Licenses from the Central Bank are necessary for the exportation of merchandise. In the case of exports to Nicaragua, transactions are required to be channeled through the Central American Clearing House in cases of advance payment in U .S. dollars, barter arrangement, or letters of credit confirmed by a prime bank abroad. In addition to the export license from the Central Bank, other export licenses are required as follows: strategic materials, such as armaments, munitions, scrap iron, and scrap of nonferrous base metals (from the Ministry of Economy and Commerce); sugar (from the Agricultural Industrial Board for Sugarcane); beans, rice, potatoes, onions, cotton, meat, and purebred cattle (from the National Council of Production); airplanes (from the Civil Aviation Board and the Ministry of Economy and Commerce); Indian art objects made of gold, stone, or clay (from the National Museum); tobacco (from the Tobacco Defense Board); lumber, root of ipecacuanha, certain livestock, and animals and plants of forest origin (from the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock); and COSTA RICA coffee (from the Coffee Office); in addition, when there is a lien on coffee in favor of a bank, that bank's approval is required before the Central Bank grants an export license. Exports to South Africa are prohibited. The exchange proceeds from coffee, bananas, sugar, beef, bovine cattle, and other perishable items must be surrendered within 30 days of shipment; within 90 days of shipment for exports of other agricultural goods as well as industrial goods; and within 180 days of shipment for capital goods. Foreign-owned banana com- panies that have contracts with the Government must surrender their net export proceeds, which are calculated by deducting from their gross export proceeds (1) profits obtained during the year from their transactions in Costa Rica; (2) the allowance for depreciation on their invest- ment in Costa Rica that is acceptable to the U .S. Internal Revenue Service; (3) the export tax on bananas payable in foreign currency; and (4) the cost of imports made during the year that were necessary for their normal business in Costa Rica. There are no taxes on nontradi- tional exports to countries outside of the Central Ameri- can Area and Panama, while traditional exports do pay tax, in some cases graduated in line with the interna- tional prices. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles are free from controls or restrictions, but receipts from invisibles must be sold to the Central Bank or other authorized institutions. Capital All capital transfers between residents and nonresi- dents may be made, subject to prior authorization by the Central Bank. Capital received by the private sector may be registered at the Central Bank of Costa Rica, provided that it meets various requirements, including the require- ments that (a) the project financed with the funds has (or will eventually have) directly or indirectly, a positive effect on Costa Rica's balance of payments, (b) the amount of the capital is not less than US$5,000, and (c) the individual concerned sells the foreign exchange to the Central Bank. The registration guarantees the indi- vidual that the Central Bank will sell to him the exchange required to service the debt at the exchange rate in force at the time the servicing is effected. The National Budget Au thor i ty2 is in charge of authorizing the negotiation of new external credits contemplated by the Central Gov- ernment, decentralized agencies, and state enterprises. Foreign and domestic capital transferred from abroad may be deposited as time deposits in U .S. dollars with agent banks in the form of specified foreign currencies or be invested in certificates of deposit denominated in colones; such funds, when they mature, are repaid in the currency in which the deposits were made. 2Composed of the Minister of Finance, the Minister of P lann ing, and the President of the Central Bank. 163 ©International Monetary Fund.

Private physical and juridical persons may negotiate freely, at home or abroad, domestically produced gold (except national archaeological treasures), provided there is no infraction of international agreements. As in the case of other exports, licenses from the Central Bank are required for exports of gold. Gold may also be held in any form in Costa Rica. The Central Bank does not supply gold to artistic or professional users. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement October 25.

In addition, a commercial exchange program was estab- lished with Nicaragua on a one-to-one basis. 164 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CYPRUS (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Cyprus is the Cyprus Pound. The exchange rate for the Cyprus pound is adjusted daily with the aim of maintaining its effective relationship with the currencies of the main trading partners. On December 31, 1984 the official buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, were £C 0.6435 and £C 0.6447, respectively, per US$1. The Central Bank of Cyprus also quotes daily buying and selling rates for the deutsche mark, the Greek drachma, and the pound sterling. It also quotes indicative rates for other foreign currencies1 on the basis of market rates in international money market centers. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. The Central Bank offers authorized dealers (banks) facilities for forward purchases and sales of U .S. dollars and pounds sterling for periods of up to six months, in respect of trade and tourist transactions only. Rates for longer periods are available for exports and tourism on request. Administration of Control Exchange controls are administered by the Central Bank in cooperation with authorized dealers. Authority to approve applications for the allocation of foreign exchange for a number of purposes has been delegated to authorized dealers. Prescription of Currency Payments may be made by crediting Cyprus pounds to an External Account, or in any foreign currency;2 the proceeds of exports to all countries may be received in Cyprus pounds from an External Account, or in any foreign currency. Nonresident Accounts Residents of countries outside Cyprus may open and maintain with authorized banks nonresident accounts in Cyprus pounds, designated External Accounts, or Foreign Currency Accounts. These accounts may be credited freely with payments from nonresidents of Cyprus (such as transfers from other External Accounts or Foreign Currency Accounts), proceeds from sales of any foreign currency by nonresidents (including declared bank notes), and the entire proceeds, including capital appreciation, from the sale of an investment made by a nonresident in Cyprus with the approval of the Central Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs (commer- cial), Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. 2Foreign currencies are all currencies other than the Cyprus pound.

External Accounts and Foreign Currency Accounts may be debited for payments to residents and nonresidents, for remittances abroad, for transfers to other External Accounts or Foreign Currency Accounts, and for pay- ments in cash in Cyprus. Companies registered or incorporated in Cyprus which are accorded nonresident status by the Central Bank may maintain External Accounts and Foreign Currency Accounts in Cyprus or abroad. Blocked Accounts are maintained in the name of nonresidents for funds that may not immediately and in their entirety be transferred outside Cyprus under the existing exchange control regulations. Blocked funds may either be held as deposits or be invested in government securities or government-guaranteed securi- ties. Income earned on blocked funds so invested is freely transferable to the nonresident beneficiary or it may be credited to an External Account or Foreign Currency Account. In addition to income, the principal released in each such case annually for transfer outside Cyprus may not exceed £C 5,000. Funds can also be released from Blocked Accounts to meet reasonable educational expenses in Cyprus of the account holder's children, reasonable living expenses of the account holder while visiting Cyprus, donations to charitable institutions in Cyprus, and for other authorized purposes. Imports and Import Payments Imports of fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, and fresh meat are prohibited. Most other imports are free of licensing requirements. Only imports of certain com- modities require an import license. Such commodities include goods produced or manufactured locally, as well as all machinery, plant and equipment, spare parts and accessories. The Minister of Commerce and Industry may take measures whenever required to regulate the importation of goods for the encouragement of local production and manufacture. Exchange is allocated to pay for imports freely and without restriction through authorized banks, provided that documentary evidence of shipment or actual importation of goods is available. Advance payments before shipment require the prior approval of the Central Bank, except for imports whose value does not exceed £C 100. Payments for imports free from licensing requirements effected after 200 days from the date of shipment also require the approval of the exchange control authorities. Payments for imports requiring a license are expected to be made within the time limits specified on the license. An import surcharge of 6 percent (3.9 percent for imports from EC countries) ad valorem is levied on all imports except food, feedstuff, pharmaceuticals, and goods imported by the Government. 165 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CYPRUS Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles abroad require the approval of the Central Bank, but approval for certain types of payments has been delegated to authorized banks. Profits, dividends, and interest from approved foreign investments are transferable abroad without limitation, after payment of any due charges and taxes. Insurance premiums due to foreign insurance companies are remit- table after deduction of all contingencies. Allowances are granted for study abroad at colleges, universities, or other institutions of higher education. Education allow- ances for lower-level institutions may be approved by the Central Bank. Exchange allowances are based on the cost of living and cover the full amount of tuition fees plus living expenses for the student. For studies in the Eastern Mediterranean, the Middle East, Yugoslavia, and COMECON countries, the maximum yearly allowance for living expenses is £C 1,700; for Canada and the United States, £C 4,000; for the United Kingdom, £C 2,800; and for all other countries, £C 2,500. There is no limit for the remittance of foreign exchange for payment of tuition fees. The exchange allowance for tourist travel is £C 350 a person a year; the allowance for business travel is not fixed, but depends on the length of stay abroad, the country or countries to be visited, and the purpose; for medical treatment abroad, the amount is unlimited but based on actual expenses. On leaving Cyprus, travelers may take out with them up to £C 10 in currency notes. There is no limit on the amount of foreign currency notes that departing residents may take out of the country as part of any of their foreign exchange allowances. Nonresident travelers may take out any amount of foreign currency notes they declared on arrival. In addition, authorized banks may convert up to £C 100 into foreign currency for departing nonresi- dents. Furthermore, authorized banks are permitted to issue to nonresidents any amount of foreign currency notes against external funds. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of potatoes and carrots are subject to control by the respective Marketing Boards, and those of wheat, barley, and maize to control by the Cyprus Grain Commission. Exports of cement are subject to a license for the purpose of ensuring adequate domestic supply. All exports are subject to licensing when the f .o .b. value exceeds £C 100, to ensure the inflow of the sales proceeds. Export proceeds must be surrendered without delay. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles must be sold to an authorized bank. Persons entering Cyprus may bring in any amount in foreign currency notes and up to £C 10 in Cyprus currency notes. Capital Payments abroad of a capital nature require prior approval. Applications for outward direct investment by 166 residents are approved provided they are expected to contribute to foreign exchange inflows and the exporta- tion of goods and services. Such investments include those by construction and tourist companies. Investments in Cyprus by nonresidents require also the prior approval of the Central Bank. In considering applications, due regard is given to the purpose of the investment, the extent of possible foreign exchange savings or earnings, introduction of know-how, and, in general, the benefits accruing to the national economy. Foreign direct investment is normally permitted in selected fields of production such as export-oriented industries and new products. Yearly profits and proceeds from the liquidation of approved foreign investments may be repatriated in full at any time, after payment of any due charges and taxes. With the permission of the Council of Ministers, alien nonresidents may acquire in Cyprus immovable property for use as a residence or holiday home; they are required to pay the value of such property in foreign exchange. The sales proceeds of such property are transferable outside Cyprus up to the amount originally paid for the purchase of the property; the balance, if any, is transfer- able at the yearly rate of £C 5,000. Residents of Cyprus (Cypriots or foreign nationals) who take up residence outside Cyprus may transfer abroad immediately up to £C 5,000; any excess amount is deposited in a Blocked Account. The transfer abroad of funds resulting from estates and intestacies and from the sale of real estate is limited to £C 5,000, with any excess amount to be credited to a Blocked Account. Transactions in foreign securities owned by residents require prior permission from the Central Bank. In principle, all securities held abroad by residents are subject to registration. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Cyprus for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities, authorized dealers in gold, and industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Authorized dealers in gold are permitted to import gold only for the purpose of disposing of it to industrial users. The export of gold requires the permis- sion of the exchange control authorities. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement June 27. Formal requirements for forward exchange contracts were relaxed, with a view to facilitating export trade. Payments for Invisibles June 25.

Not for Redistribution DENMARK (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Denmark is the Danish Krone. Denmark participates with Belgium, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands in the exchange rate and intervention mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS). In accordance with this agreement, Denmark maintains the spot exchange rates between the Danish krone and the currencies of the other participants within margins of 2.25 percent (in the case of the Italian lira, 6 percent) above or below the cross rates based on the central rates expressed in European Currency Units (ECUs). The agreement implies that the National Bank of Denmark (the central bank) stands ready to buy or sell the currencies of the other participating states in unlim- ited amounts at specified intervention rates. On Decem- ber 31, 1984 these rates were as follows: Specified Intervention Rates Per: 100 Belgian or Luxembourg francs 100 deutsche mark 100 French francs 100 Netherlands guilders 100 Irish pounds 100 Italian lire Danish Kroner Upper limit Lower limit 18.543 371.40 121.11 329.63 1,147.35 0.6159 17.727 355.06 115.78 315.13 1,096.87 0.5463 The participants in the EMS are not maintaining the exchange rates for other currencies within fixed limits. However, in order to ensure a proper functioning of the system, the Danish central bank intervenes to smooth out fluctuations in exchange rates, the intervention currency being primarily the U .S. dollar. Middle rates for 20 foreign currencies are quoted daily on the basis of market rates.1 On December 31, 1984 the middle rate for the U.S. dollar was DKr 11.26 per US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Authorized exchange dealers may engage in arbitrage both spot and forward. Spot transactions are defined as transactions where actual delivery takes place within two banking days; transactions that mature in three banking days or more are defined as forward transactions. Spot transactions in all currencies, including Danish kroner, and forward transactions involving purchases of foreign currencies against sales of foreign currencies may be concluded freely with domestic and foreign banks. Forward transactions that involve Danish kroner may also be concluded, but for not more than three years.

Forward premiums and discounts are generally left to the interplay of market forces. Forward transactions that involve resident and nonresident purchases of foreign currencies against sales of Danish kroner must cover contractual payments, the payments covered being due not more than three years from the date of the forward contract. There are no restrictions on forward transac- tions that involve resident and nonresident purchases of Danish kroner against sales of foreign currencies, other than the three-year limit on maturity. Denmark formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from May 1, 1967. Exchange Control Territory The Danish Monetary Area comprises Denmark, Greenland, and the Faeroe Islands. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the National Bank and the authorized exchange dealers, that is, most banks, some savings banks, and some stock exchange brokers who are members of the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. The exchange regulations generally do not apply to individual transactions and transfers of DKr 25,000 or less. Transfers of up to DKr 25,000 may, in any event, be made without delivery of forms. Permission, when required, for foreign direct invest- ments in Denmark has to be obtained from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Licenses for imports and exports, when required, are issued by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Agriculture, or the Ministry of Fisheries. Prescription of Currency Payments to or from foreign countries may be made in any foreign currency or in Danish kroner. Nonresident Accounts Nonresident Krone Accounts are convertible. The only exceptions are Emigrant Accounts. Krone Accounts may be opened by authorized banks for foreign banks, insurance companies, and shipping companies, and for institutions of the EC. They may also be opened for other nonresidents, provided that the total credit balance of the accounts of an individual nonresi- dent does not exceed DKr 300,000; any amount in excess of DKr 300,000 must be transferred abroad within three days. Special accounts not subject to a maximum balance may be opened for nonresidents, provided they are credited only with the liquidation proceeds or capital earnings from certain investments in Denmark and some other funds. Emigrant Accounts are kept by authorized exchange dealers for holding liquid assets owned by or accruing to Danish emigrants, to the extent that the amounts exceed 167 ©International Monetary Fund.

Imports and Import Payments Most commodities, except for textiles, are free of licensing from all sources. For textiles, a common EC system of export-import licenses has now been estab- lished for almost all countries exporting low-priced textiles. The only commodities that require a license when originating in or purchased from member countries of the EC are alcoholic beverages and unwrought and semimanufactured gold. A few items require a license when originating in Japan, the Republic of Korea, or any other non-state-trading, non-EC country. A larger num- ber of items require a license when originating in or purchased from Albania, Bulgaria, the People's Re- public of China, Czechoslovakia, the German Demo- cratic Republic, Hungary, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, the U .S .S .R ., or Viet Nam. Payments for imports and the related shipping ex- penses may as a general rule be made freely within five years from the end of the month in which the goods were cleared through customs, provided that the terms of payment conform to normal commercial practice in the trade concerned. Repayments of debts must not be made more than 30 days before the day stipulated as the latest in the contract (or before the latest customary date in the trade). However, commercial credits can be repaid at any time if a discount is obtained as a result, provided the payment is made to the supplier and conforms to normal commercial practice in the trade concerned. Prepayments linked to trade in goods and services that are in conformity with normal commercial practice may be granted to nonresidents up to one year prior to the expected date of import or the expected date of perfor- mance of the service; the permitted period is up to five years for capital goods (ships, aircraft, heavy machinery, and major installations) when purchased for an amount of DKr 1 million or more. All other advance payments for imports require prior approval by the National Bank. Payments for Invisibles Payments by residents for invisibles may in general be made freely; only a few cases require approval. Autho- rized banks are empowered to allow the transfer of up to DKr 40,000 a person a year of foreign nationals' wages and salaries earned in Denmark, provided that the person concerned has not resided in Denmark for more than seven years and the transfer is made to the remitter's own account abroad. Foreign exchange for travel is allocated freely and may be obtained for travel to any country, but not earlier than 30 days before the trip if the amount applied for exceeds the equivalent of DKr 25,000. Travelers may take out freely DKr 25,000 in Danish bank notes and coin, and any amount in foreign bank 168 Exports and Export Proceeds Gold is the only commodity that requires a license when exported to member countries of the EC. Except for certain items subject to strategic controls, licenses for exports to other destinations are required only for waste and scrap of certain metals and monetary gold. Export proceeds must be transferred to Denmark without undue delay unless the National Bank permits otherwise. However, this obligation does not apply to amounts that are to be used to settle or to offset certain commercial and capital payments; otherwise, foreign exchange receipts must either be offered for sale to the National Bank or to an authorized exchange dealer without undue delay, or kept in an account with an authorized exchange dealer for a maximum period of 30 days. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange derived from invisibles must be transferred to Denmark, unless the National Bank per- mits otherwise, and offered for sale to the Bank or to an authorized exchange dealer without undue delay, with exceptions similar to those that apply to export proceeds (see section on Exports and Export Proceeds, above). Travelers may bring in any amount of Danish bank notes and coin, foreign bank notes, and other Danish or foreign means of payment. Capital Both inward and outward transfers of capital and all borrowing and lending between residents and nonresi- dents are subject to exchange control and may be restricted. The general rules on exchange control issued by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce are based on EC directives on capital movements and the OECD Capital Code; no distinction is made in these rules between residents of member countries of the EC and those of the rest of the world. Residents have an obligation to repatriate proceeds realized from the sale or liquidation of assets abroad. Transfers abroad may be made by residents to pay interest on, or to redeem upon maturity, or to repurchase any Danish securities. Residents may lend amounts not exceeding DKr 500,000 in a calendar year to subsidiary companies (direct investments of loan capital) or, in the case of resident persons, to a member of the resident's family. Contributions from a parent enterprise to a branch are treated as direct investment of equity capital. Residents may buy foreign shares as portfolio invest- ments, provided that these are listed on the stock exchange, or in other cases, provided that these are acquired on the basis of a subscription right to shares or the like owned by the resident concerned, or that the ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution resident furnishes proof that he has sold foreign securi- ties to a nonresident for a corresponding amount within the last 12 months. Residents may only subscribe to or purchase foreign bonds, with an original maturity ex- ceeding two years, listed on a stock exchange. The purchases have to be made through an authorized exchange dealer against cash, and sale or redemption entitles the seller to reinvest the proceeds in other kinds of foreign securities listed on a stock exchange. No special permission is required for residents to make transfers abroad, within certain limits, in connec- tion with most direct investments or with private acquisi- tions of real estate abroad. The limits are DKr 2 million a year for each foreign enterprise for direct investments of equity capital.2 Private acquisition of real estate for noncommercial purposes and expenses related to build- ing and construction work on such property can be made without limitations. Direct investments abroad by resi- dents are normally approved in accordance with Den- mark's obligations as a member of the EC and the OECD. Authorized exchange dealers do not need special permission to grant loans to nonresidents for the financ- ing of payments to residents for purchases of Danish goods and services, provided normally that the loan is granted directly to the foreign purchaser; in those cases where the National Bank's approval is required, this is generally given when the loans are customary in the trade concerned. Permission from the National Bank is required for certain other transfers abroad of a capital nature by residents-. Danish emigrants are granted an exchange allowance of up to DKr 100,000 for each person at the time of departure. The remaining liquid assets must be credited to an Emigrant Account in the name of the owner and may be transferred abroad one year after departure, or earlier if the emigrant can show that he has taken up permanent residence abroad with the approval of the relevant foreign authorities. Inward direct investment in the form of equity capital may be made without any special license if the invest- ment does not increase total direct foreign investment in the enterprise concerned by more than DKr 5 million in each calendar year. However, investments in firms that are engaged exclusively or largely in capital investments abroad or the financing of nonresidents continue to be subject to license. In addition, a license is required if the investment is undertaken by a foreign firm in which a resident directly or indirectly owns an interest repre- senting a direct investment. Direct investments must be notified to the National Bank if they are made without a special license. Inward direct investments in the form of loans with a maturity of at least five years also are exempt from special licenses. A contribution from a parent company to a branch is treated as direct invest- ment of equity capital. Other direct investments by nonresidents require permission from the exchange 2 A license is required, however, for investments in firms that are engaged exclusively or largely in capital investments or financing. DENMARK control authorities, which is granted liberally in accor- dance with Denmark's obligations as a member of the EC and the OECD. The purchase by a nonresident of real property in Denmark normally requires a special license from the Ministry of Justice; permission is usually granted readily where real estate is to be used for industrial or similar enterprises. The sale to nonresidents of Danish bonds listed on a stock exchange does not require a special license. Nonresidents may freely purchase or subscribe to all types of Danish shares, including shares of joint stock and private companies; they may also acquire private mortgage deeds with a residual maturity of five years or more. Residents may as a general rule take up loans for up to five years from nonresidents to finance imports of commodities and services; they may also take up such loans to finance the granting of credits for exports of commodities and services, provided that the credits are in conformity with normal commercial practice and that the maturity of the loans does not exceed the borrowers' credits to nonresidents in connection with exports of goods and services. Most business enterprises may borrow abroad without restriction, provided that the maturity is at least five years. Residents may take up loans of up to DKr 500,000 a borrower in a calendar year from the borrower's family members. Foreign borrowing by municipalities and public utility companies is sub- ject to control by the appropriate department of the Government. Transfers of proceeds from the sale or liquidation of all types of investments and transfers of all other liquid funds in Denmark owned by nonresidents other than new emigrants are permitted freely, irrespective of when and how the original investment was acquired. Interest and repayment of principal on authorized loans, credits, and deposits received from persons and firms who are nonresidents at the time of receipt may be paid freely, with the proviso that loans and credits obtained from a nonresident generally must not be amortized or repaid in full more than 30 days before the amortization payment or repayment is due. Inheritances and gifts to relatives may normally be transferred to any country without limitation. Individual payments above DKr 25,000 as gifts to persons other than relatives are subject to approval from the National Bank. Imports and exports of securities are subject to regulation, the details of which are established by the National Bank. Bona fide imports and exports of Danish and foreign securities are permitted. Danish securities held in Denmark and belonging to nonresidents may, in most cases, be sold freely to residents. Foreign securities held in Denmark may be negotiated freely between residents, provided that the exchange control regulations are not circumvented. Authorized foreign exchange dealers' commercial net balances in accounts with foreign countries may be negative to the extent of an amount equal to the loans 169 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution DENMARK which the authorized dealer has granted to residents in foreign currency in conformity with the exchange control regulations and, for the purpose of financing Denmark's foreign trade, within a limit of DKr 3 million, but for banks and savings banks, the limit is up to 5 percent of net worth. A positive net commercial foreign position is, in principle, allowed only so long as it does not exceed DKr 2 million or, for banks and savings banks, 15 per- cent of the capital and reserves, whichever is higher. Gold Residents may freely buy, hold, and sell gold coin in Denmark; they may also import gold coin. Otherwise, residents other than the monetary authorities and autho- rized industrial and dental users are not allowed to acquire gold abroad. Imports and exports of gold normally require licenses issued by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial and dental users. Imports of gold in bars or coin, unless made by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, are subject to value- added tax at a rate of 22 percent; domestic transactions in gold are also taxed at a rate of 22 percent. There is no customs duty on imports of gold in bars or coin. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement January 7. In a liberalization of the rules governing forward foreign exchange contracts, restrictions on foreign exchange dealers' forward purchases of foreign currencies against Danish kroner from residents and nonresidents were lifted, provided that the maturity of the forward contracts did not exceed three years. Foreign exchange dealers' forward sale of foreign currencies against Danish kroner to residents and nonresidents would continue to be restricted to cases of corresponding contractual obligations due for payment within three years, but all restrictions on forward transactions not involving Danish kroner were abolished. Capital January 1. Purchases by residents of foreign shares listed on the stock exchange were freed from restrictions, as were foreign investments by residents in financial and commodity futures. 170 ©International Monetary Fund.

The buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar are DF 176.84 and DF 179.48, respectively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates for certain other currenciesl are set by local banks on the basis of cross rates for the U .S. dollar in international markets. The posted rates are subject to commission charges of 1.5-6.0 percent set by the commercial banks, depending on the currency concerned. In addition, there is a fixed commission amounting to DF 300 for transfers in Djibouti francs, DF 500 (or US$3.00) for transfers in foreign currencies, and zero for transfers in French francs. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. On September 19, 1980 Djibouti formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control There is no exchange control and no prescription of currency. The Djibouti franc is issued in notes and coins by the National Bank of Djibouti, which issues and redeems the currency against U.S. dollars. Deposits in U.S. dollars constitute the cover for the notes issued. Prescription of Currency All settlements with Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Otherwise, no prescription of currency re- quirements are in force. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Djibouti has a free trade zone in the port of Djibouti but Deutsche mark, French francs, pounds sterling, and Swiss francs. the territory as a whole does not constitute a free zone. Formally, no customs duty is charged on imports but, in practice, fiscal duties are levied by means of indirect taxes (the general consumption tax). The rate of the general consumption tax is 26 percent for luxury goods and 23 percent for all other goods. In addition a tax of 5 percent is levied on the c . i . f. value of most nonfood imports. Certain commodities, including alcoholic bev- erages, noncarbonated mineral water, petroleum prod- ucts, khat, and tobacco, are subject to surtaxes at various rates. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Otherwise, there are virtually no restrictions on exports, with the exception of the prohibition on exports of live animals. Export proceeds may be retained. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles No restrictions are imposed on payments for or proceeds from invisibles, except that payments must not be made to or received from Israel and South Africa. Capital No restrictions are imposed on inward or outward capital transfers, but payments may not be made to or received from Israel and South Africa. Under the Investment Code of June 5, 1975, enterprises established or expanded to undertake certain specific economic activities are eligible for various tax exemptions. Changes During 1984 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 171 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution DOMINICA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Dominica is the Eastern Caribbean Dollar,1 which is issued by the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB). The Eastern Caribbean dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at EC$2.70 = US$1. On December 31, 1984 the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were ECS2.6949 and ECS2.7084, respectively, per US$1. The ECCB also quotes daily rates for the Canadian dollar and the pound sterling. There is a 1.5 percent tax on sales of foreign exchange. Dominica informed the Fund on December 13, 1979 that it formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Ministry of Finance and applies to all countries outside the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank area. Prescription of Currency Settlements with residents of territories participating in the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank Agreement must be made in Eastern Caribbean dollars; those with member countries of the Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM)2 must be made in the currency of the CARICOM country concerned. Settlements with residents of other countries may be made in any foreign currency.3 Foreign Currency Accounts Foreign Currency Accounts may be operated only with the permission of the Ministry of Finance; such permission is normally confined to major exporters and foreign nationals not ordinarily resident in Dominica. The accounts can only be credited with foreign curren- cies obtained outside Dominica. Payments from these accounts require no approval but transactions are subject to the foreign exchange sales tax. Imports and Import Payments All imports from South Africa are prohibited. Most other goods are imported under open general license, but individual licences are required for manufactures or items which compete with local products, unless im- ported from CARICOM countries. Payments for authorized imports are permitted upon presentation to a bank of documentary evidence of JThe Eastern Caribbean dollar is also the currency of Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, Montserrat, St. Christopher and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. 2The CARICOM countries are Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Chris- topher and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. 3 Foreign currencies comprise all currencies other than the Eastern Caribbean dollar. 172 purchase. Advance payments for imports require prior approval by the Ministry of Finance. Payments for Invisibles Under existing exchange control regulations all set- tlements overseas require exchange control approval. This is normally granted for specified purposes and services, within limits; amounts in excess of specified limits may be obtained in bona fide cases. The basic travel allowance for each period of travel outside the area served by the ECCB is EC$15,000, subject to the presentation of evidence of intended travel. There is a 10 percent ad valorem tax on all travel tickets. In addition to the Basic Travel Allowance, bona fide business travelers may purchase foreign currency not exceeding the equiva- lent of EC$250 for each day outside Dominica, provided the total for the trip does not exceed EC$7,500. Persons going overseas for medical treatment may draw an amount additional to the basic allowance not exceeding EC$350 a day, up to a maximum of EC$20,000; such purchase is conditional upon the presentation of a medical certificate that states that the journey is neces- sary. Foreign currency may also be bought to meet educational expenses, including accommodation, up to EC$15,000 in each academic year. Authority will normally be given for the payment of fees and subscrip- tions to recognized institutions and for such other educational items as newspapers. Outward remittances of cash gifts are allowed, up to EC$1,000 a year to each recipient. Profits may be remitted overseas in fu l l, provided that the Comptroller of Inland Revenue has prior knowledge of the transfer. Exports and Export Proceeds. Exports to South Africa are prohibited, and specific licenses are required for the export of certain goods to any destination. The conversion of export proceeds to an Eastern Caribbean Central Bank currency account is mandatory, except where the exporter has a foreign currency account into which the proceeds may be paid. Export duties are levied on bananas, fresh fru i t, fruit juices, nuts, essential oil, and timber. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign currency proceeds from transactions in invis- ibles must be sold to a bank or paid into a foreign currency account. There is no restriction on importation of bank notes and coin. Capital All outward transfers of capital or profits require exchange control approval. The purchase by residents of foreign currency securities and of real estate located abroad is not normally permitted. Capital transfers, such as inheritances, to nonresidents require approval which normally is granted subject to the payment of any taxes ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution DOMINICA due. Emigrants leaving Dominica to take up residence outside the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank area may transfer up to EC$20,000 (for a husband, wife, and children under 18 years) from their assets, subject to income tax clearance. Approval from the Ministry of Finance is required for remittance of amounts in excess of EC$20,000. Direct investment in Dominica by nonresidents may be made with exchange control approval. The remittance of earnings on, and liquidation proceeds from, such investment is permitted, subject to the discharge of any liabilities related to the investment. The approval of the Ministry of Finance is required for nonresidents to borrow in Dominica. Any borrowing abroad by autho- rized dealers to finance their domestic operations re- quires the approval of the Ministry. Gold Residents are permitted to acquire and hold gold coins for numismatic purposes only. Small quantities of gold may be imported with the approval of the Ministry of Finance, for industrial purposes only.

Not for Redistribution DOMINICAN REPUBLIC (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Dominican Republic is the Dominican Peso. The Dominican Republic operates a dual exchange market, consisting of an official exchange market in which transactions are conducted at an exchange rate of RD$1 = US$1, and a parallel market in which all specified transactions not eligible for the official market are conducted at a freely determined rate. Other rates arise from (a) the exchange incentive of RD$0.48 per US$1 for receipts from traditional exports that are subject to surrender requirements, services (with the exception of tourism and registration fees of foreign students at Dominican universities, and export earnings corresponding to the value added by industrial free trade zones); (b) the partial exemption from the surrender requirement for exports of manufactured and agro- industrial products; (c) the application of a rate of RD$1.50 = US$1 to imports of petroleum other than those by the State Electricity Company (CDE); and (d) the levying.of a tax on remittances of profits from foreign investments, including a surtax on this tax. Exchange transactions in the official exchange market in U .S. dollars between the Central Bank and other banks take place at RD$1 = US$1 plus a commission of l/32 of 1 percent. Commercial banks charge commissions of 1A of 1 percent (buying) and l/2 of 1 percent (selling) on transactions conducted at the official exchange rate of RD$1 = US$1; an additional 1 percent commission is levied on payments by letter of credit. Foreign exchange operations are conducted in the free market through commercial banks and exchange banks. The main sources of demand for foreign exchange in the free market are (a) import payments other than imports of petroleum by the State Electricity Company and other petroleum imports for which the Central Bank sells foreign exchange at the official rate of RD$1 = US$1 and at a rate of RD$1.50 = US$1, respectively; (b) payments for invisibles except those by the Govern- ment for which the Central Bank sells foreign exchange at the official rate of RD$1 = US$1; (c) capital outflow; and (d) service payments on private debt registered after April 17, 1984. The main sources of supply to the same market are (a) inward remittances from Dominicans living abroad; (b) tourist receipts; (c) the portions of proceeds from nontraditional exports exempted from the surrender requirement to the Central Bank; (d) possible over-invoicing of imports especially when import duties are low; (e) possible underinvoicing of some exports; and (f) capital inflows not transacted through the banking system. of foreign exchange accounts for their clients.l One of these is a noninterest-bearing dollar account, from which funds can be drawn to make payments for current transactions approved by the Central Bank. The other type of account yields interest at a rate announced periodically by the Central Bank but not more than 1 percentage point below the federal funds rate in the United States; such an account is subject to a minimum deposit requirement of US$25,000. Both types of ac- count are subject to a 100 percent reserve requirement. Beginning in mid-November 1983, exchange banks have been established and empowered to purchase and sell foreign exchange in the parallel market, and the operation of exchange houses has been prohibited. (Commercial banks were permitted to continue transac- tions in the parallel market until December 31, 1983 but their sales of foreign exchange in this market were limited to transactions involving payments of goods and services.) Since mid-November 1983, the Central Bank has maintained a stabilization exchange fund at the Reserve Bank, whereby the latter may intervene in the parallel market to prevent erratic fluctuation of the exchange rate in that market. Administration of Control Exchange and trade control policy is determined by the Monetary Board, and foreign exchange control is administered by the Central Bank. Export controls are administered by the Dominican Center for Export Pro- motion (CEDOPEX). Prescription of Currency Imports from the United States that are financed by the U.S. Agency for International Development must be made under special letters of credit. Certain import commissions must be paid in local currency only. Settlements with Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, and Venezuela may be made through special accounts established under recip- rocal credit agreements within the framework of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA). Import payments in currencies other than the U .S. dollar must be made through letters of credit. Otherwise, no obliga- tions are imposed on importers, exporters, or other residents regarding the currency to be used for payments to or from nonresidents. Imports and Import Payments Imports may be classified in four categories: (a) fuel imports of the oil refinery and the State Electricity Foreign Currency Accounts Under a Monetary Board resolution of August 24, 1982 commercial banks are authorized to open two types 1 Since the end of 1971, interested natural and juridical persons could be authorized directly by the Monetary Board to open accounts denominated in U .S. dollars in the Dominican Republic's banking system.

Not for Redistribution Company (CDE), for which the Central Bank sells foreign exchange at the official exchange rate in unre- stricted amounts; (b) imports of petroleum and petroleum products other than those by the CDE for which the Central Bank sells foreign exchange at an exchange rate of RDS1.50 = US$1; (c) imports for which the Central Bank does not sell foreign exchange; and (d) imports that are prohibited, either permanently or for temporary periods of time. In principle, except for prohibited imports, all import payments can be made with foreign exchange purchased in the parallel market. All payments for imports settled with foreign ex- change at the official rate require the approval of the Central Bank. Import settlements against collection or by draft must be denominated in U .S. dollars. Prepayment of letters of credit is required for certain imports. The Monetary Board establishes annual foreign exchange quotas for certain raw material and inputs by the state agency INESPRE. Beginning from November 1983, the prohibition on imports of vehicles no longer applies, but imports are subject to an annual quota of US$25 million, for which payment is to be settled through the parallel market. In principle, "nominal duty rates" range from a minimum of 40 percent to almost 900 percent for imports of malted beverages. Most of the nominal duty rates at the three- and four-digit level of the tariff schedule range between 40 percent and 75 percent. However, a number of imports were exempted from the payment of these nominal duties. An internal consumption tax of 20 per- cent ad valorem, and a 4 percent surcharge on the total amount of all customs charges are applied on all imports subject to the minimum duty of 20 percent. Payments for Invisibles Beginning from April 17, 1984, official sales of foreign exchange for invisible payments are limited to payments by the Government, interest payments on the public debt, and interest payments on private debt registered before April 17, 1984. All payments for invisibles at the official exchange rate require the prior approval of the Central Bank. Foreign exchange at the official rate is sold only for a limited number of payments for current invisibles, and only for limited amounts. Nonresident foreign nationals working in the Dominican Republic in industries and firms that contrib- ute to the country's economic development may remit abroad up to 40 percent of their incomes, at the official exchange rate, subject to a limit of US$1,000 a month. Nonresident foreign nationals working for the Govern- ment are not subject to these limits, and nonresident foreign nationals working on the installation of new manufacturing plants have fu ll remittance rights at the official exchange rate. For graduate education abroad, exchange requests for monthly maintenance allowances of up to US$320 are approved for students in the United States, and up to US$350 for students in Europe; an DOMINICAN REPUBLIC allowance of US$1,000 each semester is granted for the payment of tuition charges. Purchases of foreign ex- change for medical treatment abroad are subject to negotiation w i th the Central Bank but cannot exceed US$5,000 in each case. Except for official travel, the Central Bank does not sell foreign exchange at the official exchange rate for travel abroad. Payments for invisible transactions not approved by the Central Bank, or in excess of the limits specified, can be made through the parallel market; such transactions include notably expenses for tourist and business travel abroad, insur- ance premiums, remittances for family living expenses, current earnings for film rentals, and royalties related to films. Applications for foreign exchange for interest and amortization payments on loans registered with the Central Bank are approved in accordance with the terms of the contract. The interest rate on foreign financing cannot be more than 3 percentage points above the U .S. prime rate when the foreign f inanc ing originates in the United States, or above the LIBOR when the foreign f inanc ing originates in the Eurodollar market. Beginning from April 17, 1984, access to foreign exchange at the official rate for the purpose of profit remittance is suspended. Profit remittances cannot during a year exceed the limit of 3 percent of the amount of the tax. Profit remittances from foreign investments are subject to a tax of 18 percent and to a surtax of 3 percent on the amount of the tax. Nonresident aliens traveling to the Dominican Re- public by air are required to possess a valid round trip ticket purchased in the country of departure; this is intended to prevent them from obtaining return air tickets with foreign exchange from the Dominican Republic's official foreign exchange market. Exports and Export Proceeds Eighteen categories of exports are prohibited, includ- ing mostly food products and certain animal species whose hun t ing is prohibited for conservation purposes. Export licenses are required for 36 categories of prod- ucts, mainly sugar, molasses, coffee, and textile prod- ucts. Exports of sugar and sugar by-products are subject to prior authorization by a special committee formed by the Secretary of Finance, the Governor of the Central Bank, and the Executive Director of the National Sugar Institute ( INAZUCAR ). With specified exceptions, exporters mus t, w i th in two working days of receiving payments, surrender to the Central Bank, through the commercial banks, foreign exchange equal to 100 percent of the value of their exports. For the purposes of exchange surrender, de- clared export prices must equal or exceed the m in imum export prices established by CEDOPEX for certain exports. Firms operating in industrial free zones are exempted from the exchange surrender requirements, and are required to convert only the foreign exchange needed by them to cover local costs and taxes. In addition, under the Export Incentives Law of November 16, 1979 (Law 175 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution DOMINICAN REPUBLIC No. 69), receipts from specified nontraditional exports are exempted partially or wholly from the surrender requirement at the official exchange rate; the exemptions vary between 60 percent and 100 percent. The exemp- tion level is 100 percent for nontraditional agricultural products and 85 percent for industrial products. Nontraditional exporters wishing to benefit from the waiver of the surrender requirement must apply to CEDOPEX, which forwards applications having its support to the Monetary Board for approval. Refunds of surren- dered foreign exchange are made in approved cases within two working days of the surrender. Under the provisions of the Export Compensation Fund, established on November 17, 1983, exporters of sugar, molasses, coffee, cocoa, tobacco, silver, gold, and ferronickel are eligible for an exchange incentive in local currency paid out of the Compensation Fund. With effect from April 17, 1984, the Compensation Fund has been replaced by a uniform exchange incentive of RD$0.48 per US$1 for nontraditional exports. Foreign exchange corresponding to the incentive payments is transferred to the Reserve Bank by the Central Bank for sale in the parallel market. In addition to the exemptions from the surrender requirements at the official exchange rate, Law No. 69 also provides for the issuance of tax credit certificates (certificados de abono tributario—CATs) for a value not exceeding 15 percent of the f .o .b. or c . i . f. value of exports; the percentage can be up to 25 percent when exports contain a high degree of domestic agricultural inputs. The CATs are, in principle, fu l ly negotiable and can be used for the payment of taxes or other obligations to the Government. However, only a limited number of CATs have been issued, and the provision is no longer operational. Law No. 69 also regulates the system of temporary admission for imports, under which duties are waived for any imports used in the manufacture of nontraditional products to be exported within a year. Nontraditional exports are entitled to a refund of a percentage of the import duties paid on raw materials or component parts used in the manufacture of goods subsequently exported; the refund is 90 percent on exports containing only imported inputs, 95 percent on exports containing domestic inputs, and 100 percent on exports produced in the industrial free trade zone.2 Exporters are also eligible for a refund of 95 percent of any internal tax levied on locally manufactured goods that are exported. Exporters may not extend credit to foreign buyers for more than 90 days from the date of shipment without authorization by the Central Bank. Proceeds from Invisibles With certain exceptions, such as those relating to tourism and remittances of Dominicans living abroad, foreign exchange proceeds from invisibles must be 2 Nontraditional exporters who qua l i fy under the temporary import regime of Law No. 69 are also fu l ly exempted from the payment of import duties. 176 surrendered to the Central Bank through the commercial banks. Such proceeds receive the official rate plus an exchange incentive of RD$0.48 per US$1. Foreign exchange proceeds from invisibles received by the Government and for registration fees by foreign students at Dominican universities are converted at the official exchange rate of RD$1 per US$1. Foreign exchange proceeds from other invisibles may be sold in the free market. The import of Dominican bank notes and coin is prohibited. Capital There are no restrictions on the inward movement of capital by either residents or nonresidents. However, direct foreign investment is regulated by Law No. 861 of Ju ly 19, 1978, wh ich created a Directorate of Foreign Investment to approve direct investment requests. Such investments must be registered with the Central Bank in local currency for the remittance of dividends through the official exchange market to be permitted for up to an annual max imum of 25 percent of the registered value. Foreign debt can be contracted directly by the Central Government, subject to congressional authorization. According to Law No. 251 of 1964, new loans by other public and private entities require Monetary Board authorization to ensure the provision of official foreign exchange for servicing the loans. The Central Bank continues to sell foreign exchange at the official ex- change rate for amortization of public debt as well as for private foreign debt registered before April 17, 1984. According to a set of criteria established by the Monetary Board on November 19, 1981, priority in the approval of new loans is given to foreign borrowing for export, import substitution, and social projects such as housing and education. Total interest charges on foreign loans are not allowed to exceed the U .S. prime rate or the LIBOR by more than 3 percent. There are also minimum maturity requirements according to the type of financing. Applications to the Central Bank by residents to transfer capital abroad through the official exchange market for portfolio investments, the purchase of real estate, etc. are normally not approved. But there are no restrictions on the amount of foreign exchange that Dominican residents can purchase in the parallel market. Gold Residents may purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in the Dominican Republic for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authori- ties and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, in the Dominican Republic or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler require licenses issued by the Central Bank; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement January 23. The proportion of export proceeds ex- empted from obligatory surrender to the Central Bank was increased to 85 percent for exports of manufactured and agro-industrial products; the exempted portion could henceforth be sold in the free market. April 17. The Central Bank discontinued the sale of foreign exchange at the official exchange rate for the following transactions: (a) merchandise imports other than petroleum and petroleum products; (b) invisibles (including profits), except for payments in foreign exchange by the Government, interest payments on public debt and interest payments on private debt registered before April 17, 1984; and (c) amortization of private debt, other than amortization of private debt registered before April 17, 1984. DOMINICAN REPUBLIC In addition, an exchange incentive of RD$0.48 per US$1 was instituted on the following foreign exchange receipts: the f .o .b. export value of traditional exports, services (except tourism and registration fees of foreign students at Dominican universities), export earnings corresponding to the value added by industrial free trade zones, and all other exports not covered by Law No. 69 of 1979. May 10. The Monetary Board took the following decisions: (1) the Central Bank would not provide foreign exchange at the official exchange rate for the payment of letters of credit which had been opened with the authorization of the Central Bank before April 17, 1984; and (2) requests for foreign exchange for profit remittances received and accepted by the Central Bank before April 17, 1984 would be honored only when deposits in Dominican pesos for equivalent amounts had been placed in the Central Bank before that date. 177 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ECUADOR (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Ecuador is the Ecuadoran Sucre. There are three exchange markets: the official market, the intervention market of the Central Bank, and a legal parallel market. On September 4, 1984 the system under which the exchange rate in the official market was adjusted at frequent intervals was terminated and the buying and selling rates in the market were fixed at S/. 66.50 and S/. 67.85 per US$1, respectively. The exchange rate in the intervention market of the Central Bank may be flexibly determined but has been kept fixed at S/. 95.00 (buying) and S/. 96.50 (selling) since September 4, 1984. The buying and selling rates for other currencies1 are officially quoted on the basis of daily buying and selling rates against the U .S. dollar in foreign markets. Proceeds from petroleum exports, specified import payments, service payments by the State Petroleum Corporation (CEPE), the servicing of registered external debt and of foreign direct investment disbursed before September 4, 1984, payments by the Central Bank of Ecuador pertaining to the refinancing of external private sector debt in accordance with Regula- tion 101/83, and foreign direct investment in the petro- leum sector are all negotiated in the official market.2 Proceeds from rionpetroleum exports, the majority of import payments, certain invisible transactions, and the servicing of registered external debt and foreign direct investment disbursed on or after September 4, 1984 are negotiated in the intervention market of the Central Bank of Ecuador. All other transactions are conducted in the legal parallel market where the exchange rate is freely determined. The parallel market buying and selling rates on December 31, 1984 were S/. 116.93 per US$1 and S/. 119.28 per US$1, respectively. A few transactions (such as payments for printed material) may be made in either the free market or the intervention market of the Central Bank. Sales and purchases of foreign exchange by oil companies are subject to a service charge of S/. 0.25 per US$1. Loan capital from international agencies and foreign governments to the Government and public institutions is converted at the intervention rate prevail- ing on the disbursement date. External loans are subject to a tax that varies between 0.5 percent and 2 percent for maturities of 6 months to 'Argentine pesos, Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Brazilian cruzeiros, Canadian dollars, Chilean pesos, Colom- bian pesos, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Mexican pesos, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Paraguayan guaranies, Peruvian soles, pounds sterling, Span- ish pesetas, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and Venezuelan bolivares. 2 On March 5, 1985, the Monetary Board adopted a modification under which 100 percent of the f .o .b. value of exports of petroleum and petroleum derivatives by the CEPE, and service payments on public external debt, other than private debt assumed by the Central Bank of Ecuador, were required to be converted at the intervention market of the Central Bank. 178 24 months. Exempted from this tax are (1) loans of more than 24 months; (2) loans from foreign governments and international agencies; (3) loans to the public sector; and (4) suppliers' credits involving no inflow of foreign exchange. An arrangement for refinancing specified private external debt involves different implicit exchange rates arising from charges imposed on the official rate to compensate for possible exchange losses. Ecuador formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, with effect from August 31, 1970. Administration of Control The Monetary Board has authority to shift transactions between the three exchange markets and has extensive powers with respect to import policy. The official and the intervention exchange markets are under the control and supervision of the Central Bank, which also issues import and export licenses and registers foreign capital. Imports entering the country as part of a direct foreign investment and imports by foreign enterprises which have contracts with the Government require prior author- ization by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Integration (MICEI) and, when exemptions from fiscal charges are sought, by the Ministry of Finance. The MICEI authorizes and supervises foreign investment in Ecuador. Prescription of Currency Most settlements with the German Democratic Re- public, Hungary, Poland, and Romania take place through bilateral accounts. Payments between Ecuador and Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uru- guay, and Venezuela must be made within the frame- work of the multilateral clearing system of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA). Exchange proceeds from other countries must be received in convertible currencies. Whenever possible, import pay- ments must be made in the currency stipulated in the import license. Imports and Import Payments Permitted imports are divided into two categories: List I, consisting of priority goods (Group I "Special"), essential goods (Group A), and semiessential goods (Group B), and List II, consisting of less essential and luxury goods. All goods not included in these two lists are prohibited. Mainly for reasons of industrial protec- tion, certain imports require prior authorization from government ministries or agencies. Prior import licenses are required for all permitted imports, with the following exceptions: books, newspa- pers, periodicals, and printed or recorded music may be ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution imported without limitation through the Central Bank at the exchange rate of the intervention market. These imports are subject to payment of the applicable taxes and charges regardless of their purpose. Medicines and spare parts for machinery and automotive vehicles are free of license when valued at US$500 f .o .b. or less, but all applicable charges and taxes must be paid on them. In addition, the State Petroleum Corporation may import supplies, materials, and equipment necessary for the conduct of its business during emergency situations without obtaining a prior import license. A few goods may be imported only from member countries of the LAI A, and some only from Paraguay. With these exceptions, import licenses are issued freely irrespective of the origin of the goods, provided that the appropriate import taxes (including import surcharges) have been paid, that the required advance deposit payment of 80 percent of import duties has been made, that prior ministerial authorization (where applicable) has been obtained, that a credit arrangement with a minimum maturity of 120 or 180 days (depending on the item) has been concluded with an outside party, and that a certificate is submitted showing that insurance has been arranged in Ecuador. Upon arrival of the merchandise, the importer must settle up to 20 percent of the total f .o .b. value in cash and must deposit sucres for the remaining amount, which has to be financed within the established minimum financing periods just mentioned. All imports that require foreign exchange from the Central Bank of Ecuador are subject to the advance deposit requirement equivalent to 20 percent of the f .o .b. value of exports for items under the Special List, and 100 percent for other items. The List I, Group I "Special," license automatically entitles the holder to obtain exchange at the official rate to cover the f .o .b. value of the import upon presentation of the shipping documents. Beginning from Septem- ber 4, 1984, all other imports are handled through the intervention exchange market. Import licenses that do not entitle the importer to foreign exchange (permisos de importation no reembols- ables) may be issued for the importation of goods financed from the proceeds of certain international loans (provided that they have been registered at the Central Bank), direct foreign investment goods, and vehicles belonging to Ecuadorans returning home after at least two years abroad; such licenses are not strictly required to import the goods concerned. All imports are subject to a tax of 6 percent levied on commercial transactions. Furthermore, all imports are subject to a service charge of 1 percent of the c . i . f. value, unless they represent gifts or foreign loans. With certain exemptions, imports on List II are subject to an import surcharge of 30 percent ad valorem. Payments for Invisibles Foreign exchange for payments in respect of certain current invisibles may be obtained from the Central Bank at the official rate. These transactions in invisibles are, in ECUADOR principle, limited to interest on foreign loans disbursed before September 4, 1984 that have been registered at the Central Bank; interest payments by the Central Bank of Ecuador in connection with the refinancing of speci- fied private sector external debt governed by Monetary Board Regulation No. 101/83 (together with subsequent modifications); dividends and profits on foreign invest- ment registered at the Central Bank and disbursed before September 4, 1984 (provided the foreign exchange was sold at the Central Bank); and payments for technical services by the CEPE. The arrangement mentioned above for the refinancing of private external debt involves different implicit exchange rates arising from the imposition of charges on the official rate to compen- sate for possible exchange losses. These rates are applicable to the refinancing of private external credits contracted or endorsed by the domestic financial system or directly by the private sector, and to payment of interests on loan proceeds sold to the Central Bank before refinancing or sold in the same way at any time if under Resolution No. 1202, or those sold at the free market beginning from July 1, 1982 up to a day prior to short- or long-term financing. Certain current invisibles are handled at the intervention exchange rate of the Central Bank —these transactions are limited to pay- ments for c. & f. on all authorized imports; interest on foreign loans registered at the Central Bank and dis- bursed on or after September 4, 1984; dividends and profits on foreign investment disbursed on or after September 4, 1984; interests on suppliers' credits provi- ded that the loans have been registered at the Central Bank; and selected public sector services payable in foreign currency. With respect to foreign loans to petroleum companies, interest, commissions, and other financial charges on foreign loans may not exceed the equivalent of 2 percent above the rates of interest of the creditor country, and annual amortization may not exceed the sum of undistributed profits, depreciation of fixed assets and liquidated assets, and any variation in working capital. Most other payments for current invisibles must be settled in the free market and are unrestricted. There are no limitations on the amounts of domestic and foreign bank notes that travelers may take out. Residents traveling abroad by air must pay a tax of S/. 602 for each exit visa. Airline tickets for foreign travel are taxed at 10 percent, and tickets for travel by ship are subject to tax at the rate of 8 percent for departure from Ecuador and 4 percent for the return trip. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports require licenses to ensure the required surrender of the exchange proceeds to the Central Bank; licenses are issued freely, subject to guarantee. All export proceeds must be surrendered not later than 30 days after shipment for coffee beans, bananas and other fruits, and unprocessed seafood products; 60 days after shipment for the remaining primary products; and 180 days after shipment for all other exports; however, the 179 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ECUADOR Central Bank may extend these periods. No surrender is required for exports effected under authorized barter transactions; however, barter transactions require a prior contract. M in imum reference prices are established for exports of bananas, coffee, fish products, cacao, and semifinished products of cacao to help ensure the fu ll surrender of the exchange proceeds. Reference prices are also established for exports of crude petroleum based on sales contracts; these serve as the basis for the calcula- tion of taxes, royalties, etc. Certain exports require prior authorization of specified ministries. Certain commodi- ties are subject to export taxes, payable at the time the export license is received, with the exception of the export tax on coffee, which is payable within one month of the receipt of the export license. Exports of coffee and cocoa are subject to a sliding-scale tax in relation to international prices; the tax ranges up to 13 percent for washed coffee, 20 percent for raw coffee, and 15 percent for cocoa. Proceeds from Invisibles Income received from investment of the international reserves of the Central Bank and from commissions charged by the Central Bank must be sold to the Central Bank at the official rate. The remaining service receipts in foreign currency accruing to the public sector must be sold in the intervention market of the Central Bank. All other receipts from invisibles may be sold in the parallel market. Travelers may bring in any amount of foreign or domestic bank notes. Capital Capital may freely enter or leave the country through the parallel market. Most borrowing abroad is subject to an exchange tax ranging from 0.5 percent to 2 percent (see section on Exchange Arrangement, above). All foreign direct investment in Ecuador must be registered with the Central Bank. New investment requires the prior authorization of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Integration. For foreign capi- tal entering Ecuador in the form of machinery and equipment, the investor must show that the merchandise has been cleared through customs and that it took the form of a "nonreimbursable" import. Additionally, the investor must present to the Central Bank the certifica- tion from the appropriate ministry that the declared value conforms to the actual value of the machinery and equipment. The Exchange Department of the Central Bank must submit a recommendation to the General Management of the Central Bank, within 30 days from receipt of the request for registration, and all pertinent documentation. Thereafter, the General Management of the Central Bank must approve or deny the request for registration for foreign exchange purposes within an additional 30 days, taking into account the interests of the Ecuadoran economy and priorities established in the country's development plans. In certain cases, where all documentation has been submitted, the Central Bank can 180 provisionally register the investment for a period of up to 90 days. Similarly, loans granted to the Government or to official entities involving the disbursement for foreign exchange must be registered for foreign exchange pur- poses with the Exchange Department of the Central Bank; for all other foreign loans, registration is manda- tory for statistical purposes. In the case of short-term suppliers' credits, no special registration procedure is required. Foreign nationals are prohibited from owning rural properties and from owning or operating mining industries within 30 miles of Ecuador's coastline or borders. The Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Integration does not authorize direct foreign investment for the purpose of establishing publicity firms, commer- cial broadcasting stations, television stations, newspa- pers, or magazines. Registered investment disbursed before September 4, 1984 is entitled to repatriation of principal and profits at the official exchange rate; foreign investment disbursed thereafter is handled through the intervention market of the Central Bank of Ecuador. Withdrawal of foreign investment from Ecuador is allowed five years after the date of registration, on the basis of a schedule agreed by the Central Bank. Profits accumulated in previous years may be repatriated also on the basis of a schedule agreed by the Central Bank. The limit on the repatriation of profit remittances is 30 percent a year, or 40 percent for firms that export at least 40 percent of their production. Residents who are private individuals are not granted official foreign exchange by the Central Bank to pur- chase securities or real estate abroad. Commercial banks are authorized to maintain accounts with correspondent banks abroad in convertible currencies. Gold Residents other than the Central Bank may export gold only in the form of filigree work, the gold content of which does not represent more than 25 percent of its market value. Imports of monetary gold are reserved for the Central Bank; such imports are treated as List I imports, payable through the official market. Imports of nonmonetary gold in bars may be made by the Central Bank and are also treated as List I imports eligible for the official rate. Gold bars are exempt from import du ty, while the duty on semiworked gold is 40 percent ad valorem; semiworked gold is treated as a List II import. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement February 29.

Not for Redistribution EGYPT (Position on January 24, 19851') Exchange Arrangement The currency of Egypt is the Egyptian Pound, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at LE 1 = US$1.42857. The established buying and selling rates of the Central Bank of Egypt for the U .S. dollar on December 31, 1984 were LE 0.700 and LE 0.707, respectively, per US$1. Established rates for 16 other convertible currencies are based on cross rates quoted in New York.2 The established rate applies on the receipt side only to proceeds from exports of petroleum, cotton, and rice, Suez Canal dues, and SUMED pipeline revenues; on the payments side, it is applied to set- tlements for imports of certain essential foodstuffs, insecticides and fertilizers, and specified capital transac- tions. A special exchange rate, equivalent to LE 0.3913 = US$1, is used for transactions under bilateral pay- ments agreements with the People's Republic of China and countries that are not members of the International Monetary Fund, as well as for liquidation of accounts related to past bilateral payments agreements.3 A differ- ent rate, also established by the authorities, is applied to specified transactions through the authorized commercial banks, including, on the receipt side, local expenses of foreign embassies, consulates, and international organ- izations; payments by foreigners for obtaining an entry visa, renewing residence permits and purchasing airline tickets; and, on the payment side, transfers by foreign aviation companies and external expenditures of domes- tic aviation companies. On January 24, 1985 the estab- lished buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar for transactions by the commercial banks were LE 0.83168 and 0.84000 per US$1, respectively. A premium exchange rate is used for all other transactions through the commercial banks; the rate is applied on the receipts side notably to workers' remit- tances, tourist receipts and exports, and on the payments side, to, inter alia, public sector imports, capital transac- tions other than those assigned to the Central Bank, private imports, and import-related transactions. The commercial banks may freely utilize up to 75 percent of their foreign exchange receipts from transactions at the premium rate; the remaining 25 percent are utilized in accordance with regulations issued by the Central Bank.

On January 24, 1985, the premium buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were LE 1.2520 and LE 1.2645 per US$1, respectively. In addition, certain transactions, including especially invisibles, take place through free accounts held with domestic banks. Forward cover is available for foreign trade transac- tions. Banks do not require prior exchange control approval for dealings or transactions in foreign currencies. Administration of Control Exchange control is supervised by a Committee for Foreign Exchange, under the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade, and is implemented under the supervision of the Under Secretary for Foreign Exchange Affairs. A foreign exchange budget is established annually. Banks are authorized to execute foreign exchange transactions, within the framework of a general authorization, without the need to obtain specific exchange control approval. The Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade supervises imports and exports. Certain imports and exports are reserved for public sector entities. Port Said City is accorded the status of a free zone. Prescription of Currency Payments to and from countries with which Egypt does not have bilateral payments agreements may be made in any convertible currency, in Egyptian pounds, or in a convertible currency to the debit or credit of the appropriate Free Account (see section on Nonresident Accounts, below), or in any other manner prescribed or permitted by the foreign exchange regulations manual. However, by a decision of the Central Bank, the proceeds from exports of raw cotton to convertible currency countries must be received in deutsche mark, Swiss francs, or U .S. dollars (in addition, for exports to France, Japan, and the United Kingdom, in the curren- cies of those countries). Settlements with countries with which Egypt has bilateral payments agreements are made according to the terms of those agreements.4 However, payments to such countries for imports and various other purposes not covered by these agreements may be made in convertible currency.

Free Accounts may be credited with transfers of convertible currency or with the proceeds from the sale of such currency; with transfers from other Free Accounts; with the proceeds of surrendered foreign bank notes, irrespective of the source; with interest on the accounts; and with the equivalent of any payment authorized in convertible currency. They may be debited for payments abroad in a convertible currency other than for imports;5 for trans- fers to other Free Accounts; for purchases of foreign bank notes or other means of payment; for any payments in Egypt, including those for exports; and for bank charges and commissions. D Accounts may be opened in the name of any resident of a country with which Egypt has a bilateral payments agreement. The accounts must be designated by the name of the partner country concerned. These accounts may be credited with receipts under the respective payments agreement and with the equivalent of transfers authorized to the country of the account holder. They may be debited for transfers to the country of the account holder and for local payments (including those for Egyptian exports) authorized by the implementing regu- lations and within the scope of the relevant payments agreement. Nonconvertible Capital Accounts must be credited with any payment of a capital nature to a foreigner living outside of Egypt which is not remittable under the exchange control regulations. Banks may debit these accounts for charges legally due from the account holder. Accounts held by individuals may be debited up to a limit of LE 2,000 a year for use by the account holder. Accounts held by juridical persons may be debited for settlement of outstanding obligations to the Egyptian authorities and for payments to residents for 5 On January 23, 1985 authorization was granted un t il March 21, 1985 for private importers w i th outstanding balances in Free Accounts and Import Accounts on January 3, 1985 to utilize funds in Egyptian pounds resulting from the sale of such balances (at an exchange rate announced by the specified committee) for imports related to the activities of the account holder. 184 services rendered, and up to a limit of LE 2,000 a year for expenses incurred in connection with the activities or residence of the holder's employees in Egypt. Resident Accounts In addition to Free Accounts, which may be opened by both nonresidents and residents, residents may hold foreign currency in two other accounts, as described below. Foreign Exchange Retention Accounts may be opened in the name of authorized recipients and credited with all or part of proceeds from certain exports of goods and nonfactor services. Public sector companies may use these funds for their purposes within the provision of the foreign exchange budget or transfer them to other public sector companies within the same sector. Private sector exporters may debit these accounts for visible and invisible payments related to their economic activity. Exporters of onions, garlic, potatoes, peanuts, and citrus fruits are entitled to retain only 50 percent of their foreign exchange earnings. Banks are allowed to pay interest on the balances in retention accounts. With specified exceptions, balances in Foreign Exchange Retention Accounts must be surrendered at the an- nounced premium rate to the commercial banks six months after the funds have been deposited. Imports and Import Payments All imports from South Africa are prohibited. A Supreme Council for the Planning of Foreign Trade is entrusted with establishing a long-term policy for exports and imports, controlling the annual export and import plan, and supervising the execution of the foreign exchange budget. Most imports from payments agree- ment countries (except those made under the "own exchange" arrangement), as well as imports of specified goods from any source, are reserved for the public sector. Imports by the central government, public authorities, and public sector companies, as well as certain private imports under the scheme for artisans and craftsmen, are effected within the provisions of the foreign exchange budget through the Central Bank and the authorized commercial banks. For purposes of administration, the economy is divided into several sectors (agriculture, industry, transportation, etc.). The annual foreign ex- change budget provides for a specific quota for each sector, and the authorities in charge of each sector decide upon the goods to be imported and the entities that are to import them within that quota. All imports financed by the Central Bank are at the established rate, with the exception of imports under bilateral payments agree- ments with countries that are not members of the Fund, which are financed at a special, more appreciated rate. A more depreciated rate applies to imports financed by commercial banks. With certain exceptions, imports by the private sector have to take place through the banking system and the related payments have to be made in domestic currency. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Import licensing is required in the case of 332 items which are subject to approval by the Import Rationaliza- tion Committee. The list of controlled items includes foodstuffs and medicines so as to ensure compliance with price controls, substitutes of domestically produced goods for protective reasons, other items that are restricted for social reasons, and imports by luxury hotels. Import licensing is not required in the case of other items, except that imports of reinforcing iron and steel bars, cement, and wood need approval by a committee at the Central Bank, before being processed by the commercial banks. After an import license has been issued for items subject to approval by the Import Rationalization Committee, and before a letter of credit has been opened, an importer is required to lodge an advance import deposit in domestic currency as a percentage of the f .o .b. value for imports, ranging from 15 percent to 50 percent. Imports by companies regis- tered under the Foreign Investment Law (Law No. 43 of 1974) are not subject to the advance import requirement. An economic development tax of 10 percent of the c . i .f. value is payable on imports; the tax is 5 percent for certain essential foodstuffs imported by the Ministry of Supply. A statistical tax of 1 percent of the c . i . f. value is payable on all imports except wheat. Payments for Invisibles Banks are authorized to provide foreign exchange for payments for certain invisibles in accordance with general authorizations and instructions and up to specific quotas. Residents may purchase, through local banks and up to specified amounts, the foreign exchange required for travel expenses and certain other purposes, at the premium rate announced for such transactions with the commercial banks. Egyptian nationals are entitled to retain their earnings in foreign exchange (except those accruing from exports and tourism) in Free Accounts and may use this foreign exchange freely for invisible payments abroad. They may also acquire additional foreign exchange through the medium of Free Accounts (see section on Nonresident Accounts, above). Travelers may not export more than LE 20 in Egyptian bank notes. Egyptian travelers may take with them any foreign exchange that they have acquired legitimately; foreign travelers leaving Egypt may reconvert their remaining Egyptian pounds after deduction of US$30 for each night spent in Egypt. Exports and Export Proceeds Apart from exports to South Africa, which are prohibited, and commodities required for the national economy that may be restricted, exports may be made free of license. Exports of many products are organized and supervised by foreign trade committees. Cotton, rice, and petroleum are exported by the public sector only, and their proceeds are subject to the three-month repatriation requirement. Proceeds from exports of movies, television pro- grams, and videocassettes must be repatriated within six EGYPT months; other export proceeds besides those from books, newspapers, and other publications must be repatriated within four months from the date of shipment. Proceeds from exports other than petroleum, cotton, and rice may be fully or partially retained in Foreign Exchange Retention Accounts. Proceeds from exports to bilateral payments agreement countries must be obtained in accordance with the provisions of the relevant agree- ment. Some exports to specified countries may be settled through indemnity accounts. Proceeds from Invisibles Earnings abroad by persons other than the Egyptian Government, public authorities, and public sector entities may be held abroad or retained indefinitely in Free Accounts. Within specified limits, receipts from the provision of local hotel, transport, or travel agency services to tourists may be retained in Foreign Exchange Retention Accounts. Many public sector and other entities are permitted to retain their receipts from invisibles in Foreign Exchange Retention Accounts, and in many instances are exempt from the periodic surren- der requirements applied to these accounts. Certain travel in Egypt by foreigners may be financed from various special accounts, such as those under indemnity agreements with certain countries. Persons arriving in Egypt from abroad may import up to LE 20 in Egyptian bank notes and are permitted to bring in, and to use locally, unlimited amounts in foreign exchange; a customs declaration is required if the traveler wishes to re-export foreign currency. Foreign travelers must convert into Egyptian currency the equiv- alent of US$150 at the established rate quoted by the commercial banks to obtain an entry visa. Capital Egyptian nationals who have deposited foreign earn- ings in Free Accounts in Egyptian banks may use this foreign exchange for any invisible payment, including transfer abroad. With this exception, outward capital transfers are restricted. Egyptian emigrants are autho- rized to transfer abroad funds up to LE 900 a person or LE 3,500 a family, and to export other personal effects and furniture up to LE 200 a person or LE 500 a family. Authorized banks are empowered to import, export, and negotiate securities and to effect transfers related to the sale or purchase of either Egyptian or foreign securities. Brokers registered on the stock exchanges of Cairo and Alexandria are authorized to intermediate in the transfer of ownership of securities, whether at home or abroad, and to undertake the local collection or payment in foreign currency of the value of the securi- ties. Foreign and joint-venture banks are required to ensure that 15 percent of their foreign currency deposits can be made available on call, if necessary, by the Central Bank. Transfers of accrued alimony are permitted in accor- dance with court orders. An amount not exceeding LE 5,000 a family —irrespective of whether the sum is 185 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution EGYPT made up of capital or income—may be released from a family's assets in Egypt to persons of foreign nationality who leave the country permanently after a period of residence of at least five years. Any amount above this limit is credited to a Nonconvertible Capital Account. Any payment of a capital nature not remittable under the exchange control regulations must be credited to a Nonconvertible Capital Account. Law No. 43 of June 19, 1974 (amended by Law No. 32 of June 9, 1977) Concerning the Investment of Arab and Foreign Funds and the Free Zones defines the treatment of new foreign investments. Requests for transfers of profits not covered by this law are considered on an individual basis. Gold Authorized banks are empowered to buy, sell, and keep abroad gold (including gold coin) and other precious metals for the account of customers entitled to hold Free Accounts. Authorized banks may import such gold and other precious metals for local deposit and may subsequently re-export them. Certain persons other than the monetary authorities, including authorized industrial users, are allowed to import precious metals and stones for industrial and local market requirements. Exports of gold and silver fabrics are permitted, provided that the sales proceeds are repatriated in convertible currency. Travelers are permitted to take out and bring in gold jewelry within specified limits. There is a free market for gold coin in Cairo. A person arriving or departing may carry jewelry and other valuables up to LE 500. Changes During January 1,1984 to January 24,1985 Exchange Arrangement March 31 (1984). Authorization was granted for commercial banks to purchase foreign exchange at a premium rate, initially set at LE 1.12 = US$1, from the domestic market as well as from abroad. April 7 (1984). The commercial banks were autho- rized to effect sales of foreign exchange at a premium selling rate of LE 1.14 = US$1 to public sector entities, and at a premium selling rate of LE 1.17 = US$1 for private sector imports of industrial inputs and construc- tion materials. July 4 (1984). The requirement that foreign travelers effect their payment of hotel bills with local currency sales at the official commercial bank rate was abolished; such sales were allowed to be effected at a premium selling rate of LE 1.12 = US$1. January 3 (1985). A 12-member committee was established to set the premium on the official commercial bank rate; the rate would apply, with specified excep- tions, to transactions by commercial banks. The commit- tee was composed of the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank (as Chairman), a subgovernor of the Central Bank, 186 two undersecretaries of the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade, and representatives of eight commercial banks (the four public sector commercial banks and four private banks on a six-month rotation basis). January 24 (1985). A circular issued by the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade specified that authorized commercial banks could freely utilize up to 75 percent of their foreign exchange receipts at the premium rate, with the remainder to be used in accordance with regulations issued by the Central Bank. Nonresident Accounts January 3 (1985). It was decided that foreign ex- change in Free Accounts could no longer be used for effecting import payments. January 23 (1985). Authorization was granted until March 21, 1985 for private importers with outstanding balances in Free Accounts and Import Accounts on January 3, 1985, to use funds in Egyptian pounds resulting from the sale of such balances (at an exchange rate announced by the relevant committee) for imports related to the activities of the account holder. Resident Accounts January 3 (1985). The Import Accounts, in effect since March 1982, were abolished and replaced by Free Accounts. Restrictions on the use of Foreign Exchange Retention Accounts were also introduced, whereby exporters may use these accounts only for visible and invisible payments related to their economic activities. Imports and Import Payments December 6 (1984). In a change of licensing proce- dures for private sector imports, a list was issued containing 332 items subject to approval by the Import Rationalization Committee; all other items could be freely imported. January 3 (1985). With specified exceptions, the "own exchange" system of financing private imports was abolished, and private importers were required to make import settlements by means of local currency payment through the commercial banks. January 3 (1985). The advance import deposit re- quirements, as a percentage of the f .o .b. value of imports, were reduced from 25 percent, 40 percent, 75 percent, and 100 percent, to 15 percent, 20 percent, 40 percent, and 50 percent, respectively. In addition, all such deposits were required to be made in domestic, instead of foreign, currency as done previously. January 5 (1985). Private importation of cars was restricted to authorized dealers on the basis of quotas, with the exception of Egyptians working abroad (who could import one car every four years) and persons needing the cars for professional use. January 21 (1985). Imports of three items hitherto exempt from licensing requirement, namely reinforcing ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution iron and steel bars, cement, and wood, were made subject to prior approval by the committee in charge of setting the premium exchange rate. January 23 (1985).

EGYPT 187 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution EL SALVADOR (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of El Salvador is the Salvadoran Colon. El Salvador maintains a two-tier exchange market system consisting of (a) an official market in which the Salvadoran colon is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at (£ 2.50 = US$1; and (b) a parallel market in which the value of the colon in principle is allowed to fluctuate, but which in practice is set by the banks. The rates of the Central Reserve Bank for transactions with the public are (£ 2.49 buying and 0 2.51 selling, per US$1. Official market transactions by commercial banks with the public take place within these limits. Buying and selling rates in the official market for other currencies are based on the daily quotations for the U .S. dollar in markets abroad. Buying and selling rates in the parallel market are not fixed by the Central Reserve Bank (which is prohibited by law to make transactions in the parallel market), but are determined by the commercial banks .l Only commercial banks and the Mortgage Bank are permitted to purchase or sell foreign exchange in the parallel market; individu- als2 may open foreign currency deposit accounts in the commercial banks and the Mortgage Bank and use the funds in such accounts to deal in the parallel market in respect of certain authorized transactions. A stamp tax of 0.1 percent is applicable to all sales of exchange; on amounts below <£ 100,000, the tax is levied at fixed amounts that may be slightly in excess of 0.1 percent. There is a third, informal and illegal foreign exchange market; in addition to unauthorized transactions, this market handles transactions not effected in the other two exchange markets because of rationing. The exchange rate in this third market fluctuates according to market forces and averaged $ 4 . 20 = US$1 at the end of December 1984. On November 6, 1946 El Salvador notified the Fund that it was prepared to formally accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control Subject to the general directives issued by the Mone- tary Board, exchange control authority is exercised by the Central Reserve Bank through its Exchange Control Department. Prior authorization by the Exchange Con- trol Department of the Central Reserve Bank is required for all payments through the official market. Authority to approve most payments through the parallel market is delegated to the commercial banks and the Mortgage 'The buy ing and selling rates in the parallel market fluctuated around C 4.00 per US$1 at the end of December 1984. 2Inc lud ing exporters of specified nontraditional products, industrial enterprises that export part of their production to destinations outside the Central American Common Market, individuals w i th income from tourism, foreign companies, embassies, and international organizations. 188 Bank. Exports of a number of commodities require licenses issued by the Ministry of Economy, subject to agreement by the Ministry of Agriculture. Since Jan- uary 30, 1980 exports of major commodities have been under government supervision. Exports of sugar are governed by the Institute Nacional de Azucar (!N- AZUCAR), and those of coffee are governed by the Institute Nacional de Cafe (!NCAFE). Prescription of Currency Payments to other member countries of the Central American Common Market (CACM)3 in respect of trade and specified invisibles must be settled in the currencies of those countries or in Salvadoran colones through the Central American Clearing House. Payments to Mexico are also settled through a clearing house. Otherwise, residents are free to make authorized payments in any currency they choose. Nonresident Accounts Accredited diplomatic missions and other foreign institutions or persons established in El Salvador may hold nonresident accounts in foreign currency with authorized banks, provided that such accounts are credited with foreign exchange received from abroad. Banks may also freely open foreign currency accounts, for any period of time and in any amount, in the names of individuals (whether of foreign or Salvadoran nation- ality) who reside abroad and, for a maximum period of six months, in the names of foreign persons residing in El Salvador for less than six months. All nonresident accounts may be utilized freely, but the commercial banks must make periodic reports to the Central Reserve Bank of the movements on such accounts. Foreign Currency Deposit Accounts Foreign currency deposit accounts may be opened only by exporters of specified nontraditional products, industrial enterprises exporting part of their products to countries outside the CACM, certain individuals with receipts from foreign companies, tourism, as well as staff of embassies, consulates, and international organ- izations. Transfers of funds between foreign currency deposit accounts are prohibited; balances in such ac- counts can be used for conversion into colones through sales to the banks at the parallel market rate, for payment of imports of goods and services, or for monthly withdrawals of up to US$2,000 to cover expenses for foreign travel, family maintenance abroad, education, medical treatment, personal insurance premiums, and other personal needs. The accounts may be opened in U .S. dollars or in any other approved foreign currency; transactions can be effected only in the currency in 3Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution which an account is opened. Accounts may be in the form of a demand or time deposit and are subject to a reserve requirement of 10 percent. The banks must place the funds thus deposited in investments abroad, on condition that the maturity of investments does not exceed 30 days for demand deposits, and provided that the maturity of investments using time deposits is the same as the maturity of the time deposit. The banks are required to pay interest on the time deposits at rates of up to 2 percent below LIBOR. Imports and Import Payments Certain imports, such as automobiles with an engine size of over 2,000 cubic centimeters or priced at more than US$14,000, certain other motor vehicles and motorcycles, buses, recreational vehicles, airplanes, pleasure boats, and other vessels not used for fishing are prohibited. Import licenses are issued by the Ministry of Economy and are required for only a few items, including airplanes, firearms, ammunition, military equipment, dynamite, cotton for industrial use, jute sacks, skins, leather, some chemical and pharmaceutical products, coffee for seeding, sugar, and saccharin. Imports valued at US$200 or more from all countries must be registered with the Central Reserve Bank before orders are placed; orders for imports eligible for foreign exchange financing through the official market must be approved by the Exchange Control Department, while approval for imports through the parallel market is delegated to the commercial banks and the Mortgage Bank. Only items considered as priority imports may be paid for through the official market.4 Imports of all consumer goods (other than milk products and medi- cines), which represent about 30 percent of the total value of imports, may be paid for only through the parallel market. Fifty percent of the imports of most intermediate goods can be settled at the official rate and the remaining 50 percent has to be paid at the parallel rate. Imports from countries outside the CACM that apply discriminatory restrictions against exports from El Sal- vador must be paid for before customs clearance, with the exception of industrial raw materials, which may be paid for within three years (medicines from Mexico may be paid for within 90 days; this applies also to imports of spare parts from Mexico by importers who are regarded as small enterprises). When suppliers abroad request payment in advance, a prior deposit of 10 percent, calculated on the value of the advance payment, is required from the importer as a guarantee. Guarantee deposits are refunded when the goods arrive in the country, provided that payment has been made in full to the exporter. In addition, all imports exceeding US$2,000 that are paid for by letters of credit or drafts (cobranzas) are subject to a 10 percent prior 4These include energy supplies, basic food items, medicines, inputs and raw materials for the agricultural and industrial sectors, and spare parts. EL SALVADOR deposit.5 The deposit may be made in cash at the Central Bank or any authorized bank. If the importer so desires, a bond issued or guaranteed by the Government or a guarantee by a bank (fianzd) in an amount equal to 10 percent of his average monthly imports may be deposited instead of cash. All payments for imports eligible for the official market must be approved by the Exchange Control Department of the Central Reserve Bank. Under the provisions of the Central American Agree- ment on Fiscal Incentives, El Salvador grants duty exonerations on imports of raw materials and capital goods to approved industrial firms. Imports originating outside the CACM are subject to an import surcharge of 30 percent of the applicable import du ty; the surcharge is not applied to certain industrial equipment and raw materials that are free of duty under the Industrial Incentive Law. Many nones- sential goods are subject to a selective consumption tax, at rates of 5, 10, 20, 25, or 30 percent. Goods of Central American origin are exempt. There has been an accumulation of arrears on pay- ments for imports. Payments for Invisibles Most payments for invisibles, except for certain student and medical expenses, official travel, and pay- ments of interest and dividends on registered capital, are prohibited in the official market and must be settled in the parallel market. Students registered with the Central Reserve Bank prior to November 30, 1981 for univer- sity, postgraduate, or technical training abroad may purchase foreign exchange in the official market up to the equivalent of US$300 a month for living expenses and up to a maximum of US$5,000 a year for educa- tional expenses. Students with scholarships financed by international organizations may also purchase foreign exchange in the official market up to the amounts specified in the scholarship. In addition, individuals studying abroad with a guarantee from the Fondo de Garantia para el Credito Educative (EDUCREDITO) or financed by the Fondo de Desarrollo Economico as of December 1, 1981 may purchase foreign exchange in the official market for the amount of their educational expenses (not to exceed US$300 a month a person for living expenses). Foreign exchange can also be purchased in the official market to cover medical and hospital expenses abroad up to US$3,000 a person, subject to a 100 percent prior deposit and substantiation through medical certification, bills, receipts, and other pertinent documents. This deposit requirement is waived when foreign exchange is requested to pay for services already rendered, subject to appropriate verification. The commercial banks and the Mortgage Bank are permitted to sell foreign exchange in the parallel market 5 Imports of raw materials for the agricultural and industrial sectors which are paid for by letters of credit under special lines of credit arranged by the Central Reserve Bank are exempt from this requirement. 189 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution EL SALVADOR for payments for invisible transactions of a personal nature (i.e., study abroad, foreign travel, medical care, family assistance, and insurance fees) within the follow- ing limits: (a) up to US$2,000 a trip to countries outside Central America for each person over 12 years of age (one half of the amount for children under 12 years), with a limit of two trips a year; (b) up to a limit of US$500 a trip to countries in Central America, with an annual limit of US$3,000; and (c) up to US$2,000 a year for personal expenses, such as family maintenance and insurance premiums. Additional amounts for foreign travel and family remittances can be sold to meet bona fide requirements; there is no limit on the amount that can be sold to meet expenses for medical treatment and study abroad. There are arrears on payments for certain invisibles. Exports and Export Proceeds Export licenses are not required except for certain foodstuffs and other items for which the authorities wish to ensure an adequate local supply. An export registra- tion certificate from the Central Reserve Bank is required for all exports exceeding US$200. Proceeds from tradi- tional exports (coffee, cotton, sugar, shrimp) must be received through a bank in El Salvador. All the proceeds from sugar exports must be surrendered at the official rate. A small proportion of the proceeds from coffee and cotton exports is occasionally permitted to be exchanged at the parallel rate but the bulk has to be surrendered at the official rate. Twenty percent of the proceeds from exports of shrimp and spiny lobster (langostino) must be surrendered in the official market; the remaining 80 per- cent can be surrendered in the parallel market. Fifty percent of proceeds from nontraditional exports to Central America, except medicines, fertilizers, insec- ticides, and their inputs, can be surrendered in the parallel market; the remaining 50 percent must be surrendered in the official market. Thirty percent of proceeds from exports of medicines to Central America can be surrendered in the parallel market and the remaining 70 percent has to be surrendered in the official market. Proceeds from exports of specified nontradi- tional products to countries outside Central America must either be sold to the commercial banks and the Mortgage Bank at the parallel rate or be deposited in special foreign currency accounts with authorized banks exclusively in the name of the exporters concerned. Enterprises that export part of their production to countries outside Central America can sell their foreign exchange receipts to commercial banks and the Mort- gage Bank at the parallel market rate once verification is established by the Central Reserve Bank. Exporters of nontraditional products are required to use funds in their special foreign currency accounts or to purchase foreign exchange in the parallel market to effect payments for their own imports of goods and services. Export transactions exceeding US$200 must be de- clared to the Exchange Control Department before shipment. The collection term normally must not exceed 190 90 days, but longer credit terms may be authorized by the Exchange Control Department. Exports of coffee and sugar are subject to an export tax. Proceeds from Invisibles All exchange receipts from invisibles must be surren- dered to the Central Reserve Bank or an authorized commercial bank. Receipts from personal transfers, and by representatives of foreign companies, resident indi- viduals, corporate entities, and from tourism must be sold to the commercial banks and the Mortgage Bank in the parallel market. Receipts from personal transfers may be deposited in special foreign currency accounts only in the name of the beneficiaries. Embassies, consulates, and offices of international organizations in El Salvador and their employees are allowed to sell their foreign receipts to commercial banks and the Mortgage Bank in the parallel market or deposit such receipts in the special foreign currency accounts in their names for purposes of meeting their foreign exchange require- ments. Travelers may bring in (£ 200 in domestic notes and coin. This limit is subject to modification, however, to facilitate border trade with other Central American countries. Capital All exchange receipts resulting from capital transac- tions must be surrendered to the monetary authorities, except receipts from foreign investment registered with the Central Reserve Bank after February 19, 1983, which can be sold to the commercial banks at the parallel rate. Payments abroad representing capital movements require exchange licenses; such licenses are not granted for resident-owned capital. The entry of capital with a maturity in excess of one year in the form of foreign investment must be registered with the Ministry of Economy. Registration ensures (1) free remittance of net profits on foreign capital invested in industrial enter- prises, enterprises engaged in the extraction of non- renewable natural resources, and tourist enterprises; (2) the remittance of net profits of enterprises engaged in other activities up to a limit of 10 percent a year of the registered capital (larger amounts may be authorized in special cases by the Ministry of Economy); (3) repatria- tion of the proceeds from the total or partial liquidation of the enterprise (after payment of taxes) in proportion to the participation of foreign capital in the total capital; (4) remittance of the sales proceeds of shares and other instruments representing investments or participations, including capital gains; and (5) payment of interest and amortization as determined at the time of registration. In the cases under (3) and (4), in addition to the approval of the Exchange Control Department, the prior approval of the Ministry of Economy is required. Foreign invest- ments made in El Salvador prior to June 1, 1961 must also be registered with the Ministry of Economy or the Exchange Control Department. Payments abroad representing capital movements re- quire exchange licenses; such licenses are not granted for ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution resident-owned capital. Prior approval by the Exchange Control Department is required for outward remittances of interest and amortization on short-term loans from abroad through the official market; foreign loans with a maturity of up to one year must be authorized by the Central Reserve Bank; foreign loans with a maturity of more than one year must be authorized by the Ministry of Economy. Payments related to repatriation of foreign investment and dividends must be settled through the parallel exchange market. Decree No. 279 of March 27, 1969 sets certain minimum capital requirements for businesses that are owned by foreign nationals and for those in which foreign nationals have a shareholding interest. For purposes of this decree, foreign nationals are defined as persons who are not citizens of one of the five CACM member' countries. Gold Gold coins in denominations of <£ 25, $ 50, <t 100, and $ 200 have been issued as legal tender, but do not circulate. Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in El Salvador for numismatic purposes. With this excep- tion, residents other than the monetary authorities are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Central Reserve Bank; such licenses are granted for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. In practice, imports of nonmonetary unworked gold are made only by jewelers' cooperatives acting on behalf of their members and other users. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement March 14. A preferential rate for settlements in respect of imports of certain goods and services from the Central American region was established. Such set- tlements were to be made through a special parallel market at an exchange rate of not less than 70 percent of the parallel market exchange rate for the U .S. dollar. Imports and Import Payments February 8.

July 11. It was announced that exporters of nontradi- tional goods marketing part of their production to countries outside the Central American region could sell all such export proceeds in the parallel market or deposit them in the special foreign currency accounts. (Prev- iously, the eligible export level was at least 15 percent of total production.) November 14. With effect from December 3, 1984, 50 percent of proceeds from nontraditional exports to Central America (other than those of medicines, fer t i l iz- ers, and insecticides and their inpu ts), as well as 30 per- cent of proceeds from exports of medicines to Central America, were made eligible for surrender in the parallel market. 191 ©International Monetary Fund.

Not for Redistribution EQUATORIAL GUINEA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement1 The currency of Equatorial Guinea is the Equatorial Guinean Ekwele, which is issued by the Bank of Equatorial Guinea (the central bank), and is pegged to the Spanish peseta at a rate of EK 1 = Pta 0.5. The ekwele replaced the Equatorial Guinean peseta and was at par with the Spanish peseta, which was Equatorial Guinea's intervention currency until July 12, 1977, when the Spanish peseta was devalued. Thereafter, Equatorial Guinea suspended exchange operations, with the exception of some small transactions that took place on the basis of a fixed relationship between the ekwele and a currency basket. From April 9, 1979 to August 5, 1979 the ekwele was pegged to the SDR at the rate of Bipk. 90 = SDR 1. From August 6, 1979 to June 20, 1980 the ekwele was pegged at par to the Spanish peseta, that is, EK 1 = Pta 1. On June 21, 1980 the ekwele was depreciated to a rate of EK 1 = Pta 0.5. There are no forward exchange facilities. There is a 2 percent levy on sales of foreign exchange, and exchange taxes ranging from 8 percent to 35 percent, depending on the transac- tion, are levied on certain transfers abroad. In addition, an exchange levy of 10 per mill applies to all foreign exchange transactions. Administration of Control Exchange control authority is exercised by the Bank of Equatorial Guinea, and exchange transactions must be carried out through that Bank. Import and export licenses originate from the Bank of Equatorial Guinea and are issued by the Directorate-General of Trade and Enter- prise Promotion in the Ministry of Industry and Trade. In addition to the Bank of Equatorial Guinea, the Office of the President handles the approval or rejection of all invisible transactions. Import licenses are passed on by the Ministry of Industry and Trade to the importer and to the local bank at which the importer is to open the necessary letters of credit. Prescription of Currency Settlements with all countries are made in convertible currencies. Imports and Import Payments All commercial imports require an import license. Licenses normally are issued within the framework of an annual import program and a monthly license budget approved by the Technical Cabinet. The importer is 'E f fec t ive January 1, 1985 Equatorial Guinea became a member of the Central African Monetary Un ion, and changed the national currency to the CFA franc (CFAF) which is pegged to the French franc (F), the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. In addition, w i th effect from the same date, Equatorial Guinea began to apply exchange control regulations based on the system in place in the French Franc Area; this entailed substantial liberalization of external trade and payments. allowed 30 days to open the necessary letters of credit at a local bank, after which the license may be canceled by the Bank of Equatorial Guinea. Imports must be made within three months from the date of the opening of the letters of credit. The Bank of Equatorial Guinea deter- mines whether an import should be charged against the Spanish credit lines, and forwards, if necessary, the licenses directly to FOCOEX (a Spanish institute for the promotion of foreign trade) for further processing. In principle, foreign exchange is automatically made avail- able upon the arrival of the goods in Equatorial Guinea; most import payments are effected under irrevocable letters of credit. All imports are subject to a prior payment covering the fu ll amount of the applicable import duty. Final assessment of the import tax is made at the time of registration of the import payment upon declaration of the arrival of the goods. Existing import regulations apply to all imports by private firms as well as by state enterprises and the Government. Payments for Invisibles All payments for current invisibles require the prior approval of the Office of the President and of the Bank of Equatorial Guinea. Residents2 are, in principle, granted foreign exchange up to the equivalent of Bipk. 25,000 a person a calendar year for tourist travel abroad; only one trip a year is allowed for this purpose. The standard allocation for business travel is the equivalent of Bipk. 50,000 a trip, and only two trips a year are allowed. For study abroad and travel abroad for health reasons, foreign exchange is, in principle, granted to cover reasonable costs. Residents may, in principle, send family remittances up to 30 percent of their taxable earnings and wages. In principle, enterprises classified as "of national interest" (see section on Capital, below) may transfer abroad freely up to 25 percent a year of the net investment income generated by their exporting activi- ties. Any additional transfer is subject to a tax of 20 per- cent. The transfer abroad of net investment income by enterprises classified as "of preferential interest" is subject to a 20 percent tax. Any other enterprise with foreign capital participation may transfer net investment income, but such transfers are subject to a tax of 35 per- cent on the amount transferred. In the event of at least 30 percent of such net investment income being rein- vested in Equatorial Guinea, the incidence of tax is reduced to one third its normal level. Interests on foreign loans utilized for direct investment may be remitted semiannually, subject to a tax of 8 percent. Branches and subsidiaries of foreign companies established in Equato- rial Guinea may transfer to their parent companies 2 Residents are defined as persons remaining in Equatorial Guinea for more than six months in a calendar year or for more than six months in two consecutive calendar years. 193 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution EQUATORIAL GUINEA abroad, on account of general expenses, an amount not exceeding 10 percent of the net annual profits of the branch or subsidiary. Transfers abroad in respect of patents, trademarks, and royalties are, in principle, permitted freely, subject to prior review by the Bank of Equatorial Guinea and to a tax of 25 percent of the amount remitted. Travelers may not take out more than Bipk. 1,000 a person in domestic bank notes. Residents may only take out foreign bank notes and coin acquired from the Bank of Equatorial Guinea. Nonresidents may take out foreign bank notes and coin up to the amount that they declared at the time of entry. Any excess, however, may be authorized if appropriate documentation is presented that the excess was obtained from a resident in a law ful Exports and Export Proceeds All commercial exports require an export license. Licenses are normally valid for three months. All export proceeds must be surrendered to the Bank of Equatorial Guinea within 45 days of their receipt. Although exports can be freely effected by any licensed exporter, the Chambers of Commerce, Agriculture, and Forestry of Bioko and Rio Mun i, which operate as private, non- profit, cooperative associations, have jurisdiction over the marketing of most agricultural exports. Proceeds from Invisibles All exchange receipts from invisibles must be surren- dered to the Bank of Equatorial Guinea within 15 days. Travelers may bring in any amount of foreign bank notes and coin, but the import of domestic currency by travelers is limited to Bipk. 1,000 a person. Capital All imports and exports of capital require approval by the Bank of Equatorial Guinea. In addition, all exports and imports of capital by the State must be subject to a prior evaluation by the Technical Cabinet. Capital receipts in foreign currency must be surrendered to the Bank of Equatorial Guinea. The approval of a foreign loan contract automatically gives the right to the bor- rower to make payments abroad for interests, commis- sions, and amortization specified in the approved con- tract. Without the explicit approval of the Bank of Equato- rial Guinea, no Equatorial Guinean companies or per- sons residing in Equatorial Guinea may hold accounts in foreign currency either in local or in foreign banks. Foreign residents in Equatorial Guinea are subject to the same regulation only with regard to the foreign exchange acquired as a result of their activities in Equatorial Guinea; they may hold foreign currency accounts in local or in foreign banks with regard to foreign exchange acquired as a result of activities carried out abroad. These provisions apply also with regard to the proceeds from exports and from invisibles. Under the Foreign Investment Law of November 17, 1979, three categories of foreign investment are recog- nized: (1) investments "of national interest" (mainly in industrial or forestry enterprises engaged in the export trade); (2) investments "of preferential interest" (mainly in enterprises engaged in import substitution); and (3) nonqualified investments. Investments by nationals of or entities domiciled in South Africa are prohibited. All foreign investments require the approval of the Presidency. If authorization is given by the Presidency, the Government or citizens of Equatorial Guinea may own stocks of foreign enterprises established in Equato- rial Guinea not exceeding 25 percent of the capital. The foreign share in Equatorial Guinean enterprises might exceed 50 percent of the capital. Foreign loans and capital utilized for financing direct investment may be repatriated annually up to the amortization of fixed assets, free of taxes. The transfer abroad of funds from the sale of fixed assets and financial assets by alien residents or by nonresidents is, in principle, permitted as follows: 50 percent of the total amount realized net of taxes may be remitted abroad immediately and the balance in 24 equal monthly installments. The sale of real estate, however, requires prior approval. Gold All purchases and sales of minted gold and gold bars are centralized in the Bank of Equatorial Guinea, which also has a monopoly over the import and export of minted gold and gold bars. Except for jewelry, residents are not permitted to hold gold. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement August 27. Equatorial Guinea signed the agreement on its membership in the Central African Monetary Union, with effect from January 1, 1985, from which date the Equatorial Guinean ekwele was replaced by the CFA franc as the currency of Equatorial Guinea. 194 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ETHIOPIA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Ethiopia is the Ethiopian Birr, which is pegged to the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, at the official rate of Br 2.07 = US$1. Buying and selling rates for certain other currencies are also officially posted; daily quotations by the National Bank of Ethiopia (the central bank) are set on the basis of the official rate for the U.S. dollar and the previous day's closing rate of the currency concerned against the U .S. dollar in London. The National Bank does not deal with the public; its transactions in U .S. dollars with the authorized dealers take place at the official rate. Autho- rized dealers must observe the official rate for the U .S. dollar and prescribed commission charges, which accrue to the National Bank, of 0.50 percent buying and 1.50 percent selling; in addition, they are authorized, but not obliged, to levy service charges for their own account of up to 0.25 percent buying and 0.75 percent selling and, for currencies other than the U.S. dollar, to include the margin charges applied by the correspon- dents abroad. In practice, the authorized charges are usually levied. These commissions are applied also to the National Bank's dealings with the Government and certain public sector entities. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Authorized dealers require the approval of the National Bank to undertake forward exchange transactions. Administration of Control All transactions in foreign exchange must be carried out through authorized dealers under the control of the National Bank. All payments abroad require licenses issued by the Exchange Controller, whose office is a division of the National Bank. All exports are licensed by the Exchange Controller to ensure the surrender of the foreign exchange proceeds, and shipments require per- mits issued by that office. The Minister of Foreign Trade has statutory authority to prohibit, restrict, or regulate imports and exports. Prescription of Currency Outgoing payments are normally made in convertible foreign exchange appropriate to the country of the recipient or in U .S. dollars. The net proceeds of exports must be received in a foreign currency that is freely convertible, or in any other acceptable foreign currency. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents may, subject to exchange control ap- proval, open nonresident accounts either in birr or in foreign currencies at authorized banks. Deposits to these accounts can only be made in foreign exchange. Bal- ances on nonresident foreign currency accounts may be freely transferred abroad. Transfers between nonresident accounts do not require prior approval. Members of the diplomatic community must use transferable or nontrans- ferable birr accounts for payments of local expenses. No resident Ethiopian national may maintain a bank account abroad. A joint venture may be permitted to open foreign currency, transferable or nontransferable, birr accounts, for the purchase of raw materials, equipment, and spare parts not available in the local market. As soon as the goods are received, documentary evidence of entry of the goods purchased with such funds must be submitted to the Exchange Control Division. In general, the accounts may only be replenished after such documents have been presented. Blocked accounts of nonresidents are maintained with authorized banks and are used to retain funds in excess of Br 20,000 arising from disinvestments in Ethiopia (see section on Capital, below). Imports and Import Payments All imports from South Africa are prohibited. Pay- ments abroad for imports require exchange licenses, which are obtainable upon presentation of a valid importer's license. Approval of applications for ex- change licenses is conditional upon the provision of satisfactory information on costs and payment terms and the submission of evidence that adequate insurance has been arranged with the Ethiopian Insurance Corporation, particularly for goods imported under letters of credit. Foreign exchange is not made available for a specified range of imported goods (including alcoholic beverages and certain durable consumer goods) considered to be nonessential or readily substitutable by domestic prod- ucts. Exchange licenses are granted in the currency appropriate to the country of origin, or in any convertible currency that may be requested. Payments by letter of credit, mail transfer, telegraphic transfer, or cash against documents at sight are all normally acceptable, but the National Bank must be consulted regarding imports on a cash against documents basis. Goods that were prev- iously subject to advance deposit requirements (about 100 items, mostly consumer goods) may not be financed on an acceptance basis, and virtually no imports take place on this basis. Importation on suppliers' credit is prohibited except for goods such as raw and intermediate materials, pharmaceuticals, and machinery and transport equipment, in which case prior approval of the terms and conditions of the credit is required. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles require exchange licenses. Invisibles connected w i th trade transactions are treated on the same basis as the goods to which they relate. Foreign employees may remit monthly up to 30 percent of their net earnings (but only for the first three years of their contract if employed by the private sector); they 195 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ETHIOPIA may remit a maximum ranging between 40 percent and 50 percent of total net earnings during the period of service and upon final departure. Other expatriate em- ployees may on final departure take out the same maximum amount, but not more than Br 20,000 in any one year. Foreign nationals who are not entitled to remittance facilities may, however, remit up to 30 percent of their net earnings for the education of their children. Persons traveling abroad are allowed foreign exchange equivalent to Br 125 a day for a maximum period of 30 days in any one calendar year if the journey is made for business purposes; for tourism, persons 18 years of age or over are allowed up to the equivalent of Br 600 a year. Students are allowed foreign exchange up to the equivalent of Br 500 for study abroad, and Ethiopian nationals having dependents pursuing higher studies in accredited institutions abroad are allowed to remit funds to meet school fees and reasonable expenses. Residents may remit premiums on insurance policies taken out before April 1962. Subject to certain limits and to submission of evidence, persons may obtain foreign exchange for medical treatment and travel abroad. After providing for payment of local taxes, foreign companies may, in principle, remit dividends on their invested and reinvested capital in any currency. Travelers may take with them a max imum of Br 10 in Ethiopian bank notes. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. Exports of most cereals to any destination other than Djibouti also are prohibited. Exports of horsebeans are suspended. All commodity exports require permits from the Exchange Controller and some require, in addition, the approval of specified public bodies. When applying for a permit, an exporter must specify the goods to be exported, the destination, and the value. For exports on a c . i . f. basis, exporters must obtain fu ll insurance from the Ethiopian Insurance Corporation. The granting of a permit by the Exchange Controller enables the goods to pass through customs. The licensing system is used to ensure that foreign exchange receipts are surrendered to the National Bank, generally within three months, and that export proceeds are received in an appropriate currency (see section on Prescription of Currency, above). Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange receipts from invisibles must be surrendered. Travelers may bring in Br 10 in Ethiopian currency. Foreign exchange must be declared by travel- ers on entry, and its re-export is subject to authorization, except for temporary visitors. Reconversion of birr must be supported by documentary evidence of prior exchange of foreign currency. Capital Controls over capital movements are designed to restrict outflows, to preclude an unwarranted accumula- tion of external debt, and to keep the authorities informed of the country's external debt position. 196 All receipts of capital in the form of foreign exchange must be surrendered. Exchange control authorization is required, and registration of capital inflows with the exchange control authorities establishes evidence of receipt, which is required for repatriation. All recog- nized and registered foreign investments may be ter- minated on presentation of documents regarding liquida- tion and payment of all taxes and other liabilities. Subject to appropriate documentation, foreign busi- nessmen having nonregistered investments may transfer their capital abroad on liquidation and final departure from Ethiopia, but may not transfer more than Br 20,000 in any one calendar year; funds in excess of this amount must be deposited in a blocked account with an autho- rized bank. (This regulation does not apply to joint ventures established under the new foreign investment code.) Transfers by emigrants who had operated their own businesses are restricted to Br 20,000 in any one calendar year. Joint ventures are permitted between the Ethiopian public sector and foreign investors, with up to 49 percent foreign ownership, except in the precious metals, public utilities, telecommunications, banking and insurance, transport, and domestic trade sectors. All applications for joint ventures must be approved by the National Revolutionary Development and Central Planning Su- preme Council and registered with the Domestic Trade Ministry; a m in imum of 25 percent of share capital is required to be paid before registration. Exemptions from income taxes are granted for up to five years for new projects, and for up to three years for extensions to existing projects. Imports of investment goods and spare parts for such ventures are also eligible for exemptions from customs duties and other specified import levies. Such ventures must be limited to 25 years in duration, but could be extended beyond this limit with the approval of the Council of Ministers. Borrowing abroad requires exchange control approval and is restricted. Authorized banks may freely place their funds abroad, except on fixed-term deposit, but they may not acquire securities denominated in foreign currency without the permission of the National Bank. In addition, they need the prior approval of the National Bank to overdraw their accounts with foreign correspon- dents, to borrow funds abroad, or to accept deposits in foreign currency. Gold The ownership of personal jewelry of which gold or platinum forms a part is permitted. Unless specifically authorized by the Minister of Mines, Energy, and Water Resources, the possession or custody of 50 ounces or more of raw or refined gold or p la t inum, or of gold or platinum in the form of nuggets, ores, or bu l l ion, is not permitted. Newly mined gold is sold by the Ethiopian Mineral Resources Development Corporation to the National Bank. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require exchange licenses issued by ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution the National Bank. Such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities. Changes During 1984 Imports and Import Payments October 2. Ethiopia and Jordan signed bilateral agreements aimed at expanding trade and strengthening economic cooperation. The agreements provided for trade transactions (valued at US$70 million) involving exports of Jordanian fertilizer, clothing, and other manufactured goods in exchange for Ethiopian sugar, vegetable oils, hides, oilseeds, grain, and coffee. Provision was also made for participation in trade fairs organized in either country, as well as for an exchange of visits by trade delegations representing the private and public sectors in both countries.

Not for Redistribution FIJI (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Fiji is the Fiji Dollar, the value of which is determined on the basis of the fixed relationship between the Fiji dollar and a weighted basket of currencies of Fiji's most important trading partners. The exchange rate of the Fiji dollar in terms of the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is fixed daily on the basis of quotations for the U .S. dollar and other currencies included in the basket. On December 31, 1984 the midpoint exchange for the Fiji dollar in terms of the U.S. dollar was F$1.1430 = US$1. The Reserve Bank of Fiji provides official quotations only for the U .S. dollar. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. On August 4, 1972 Fiji formally accepted the obliga- tions of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Reserve Bank of Fiji, acting as agent of the Government; the Bank delegates to authorized dealers the authority to approve normal import payments. Except with the specific permission of the Reserve Bank, residents of Fiji are required to offer for sale to an authorized dealer all foreign currencies they receive.! The Ministry of Eco- nomic Development is responsible for the issue of import licenses, with the exception of those for gold, timber, rice, and dairy products. Import licenses for gold are issued by the Ministry of Finance, for timber by the Ministry of Forestry, and for rice and dairy products by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. Export licenses are issued by the Comptroller of Customs. Prescription of Currency Transactions with all countries are subject to exchange control. Settlements with residents of any country may be made in Fiji currency through an External Account or in any foreign currency. Payments for exports to any destination outside Fiji may be made in Fiji currency from an External Account or in any foreign currency. Nonresident Accounts A nonresident2 may maintain an External Account in Fiji currency or a Foreign Currency Account with an authorized bank; such accounts may be opened without the specific approval of the Reserve Bank of Fiji. These accounts may be credited freely with interest payable on 'Under Fiji's exchange control regulations, foreign currencies are all currencies other than the Fiji dollar. 2 A nonresident is a person or firm whose country of normal domicile or established residence is a country other than Fiji.

External Accounts also may be credited with payments by residents for which either a general or a specific authority has been given. External Accounts may be debited for payments to residents of Fiji, transfers to other External Accounts, payments in cash in Fiji, and purchases of foreign exchange. Imports and Import Payments Imports of most goods are under open general license, although imports of a range of specified goods, including tea, mild steel bars, steel shelving and racking, tubes and pipes of iron or steel, certain foodstuffs, alcoholic beverages, kerosene stoves, safety matches, seed potatoes, poly vinyl chloride pipes, PVC-insulated elec- tric wires and wiring pin clips, polypropylene bags and ropes, louver window frames, shirts, wood screws, and incense sticks and chemicals used as raw materials in their manufacture are subject to individual import licens- ing; licenses for some of these items are issued restric- tively. There is a wide range of consumer goods imported by national cooperative societies under a joint arrangement with six other Pacific Island countries. Import prohibitions are imposed on a few commodities from all sources, mainly for security, health, or public policy reasons. Payments for authorized imports are permitted upon application and submission of documentary evidence to authorized dealers who may allow payments for goods which have been imported under either a specific import license or an open general license. Authorized banks may allow advance payments for all imports, provided the goods are imported into Fiji within 90 days of the date the payment is made. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles are permitted either under a delegated authority to banks or, where large amounts or nondelegated payments are involved, upon application to the Reserve Bank of Fiji. Payments may be made freely for all bona fide current transactions. Residents of Fiji traveling to other countries may obtain from a bank, without reference to the Reserve Bank, a foreign currency travel allowance for private or business visit up to the equivalent of F$2,000 a person a journey. For an extended visit, a traveler may apply before his departure to the Reserve Bank of Fiji for funds in excess of F$2,000 a person; applications may also be made from abroad through the traveler's bank. There is no restric- tion on the number of trips a resident may make in any ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution one year. Each traveler may take with him F$100 in Fiji currency and the equivalent of F$500 in other currencies, provided that these amounts are not in addition to travel allowances approved by a bank or the Reserve Bank of Fiji. Exports and Export Proceeds Specific licenses are required only for exports of rice, sugar, wheat bran, copra meal, certain lumber, scrap metals, certain animals, and a few other items. Irrespec- tive of any export licensing requirements, however, exporters are required to produce an export permit for commercial consignment of all goods with an f .o .b. value exceeding F$l,000; this permit is required for exchange control purposes. Exporters are required to collect the proceeds of exports within six months of the date of exportation of the goods from Fiji, and may not grant credit to a nonresident buyer in excess of six months without specific permission. All foreign curren- cies must be offered for sale to an authorized dealer within one month of receipt. Proceeds from Invisibles All receipts from invisibles must be surrendered to authorized dealers. Travelers may bring in freely any amount in Fiji notes or foreign currency notes. Residents are required to sell their foreign currency holdings to an authorized dealer within one month of return. Capital The inflow of capital in any form requires specific permission of the Reserve Bank of Fiji. Foreign invest- ment in Fiji normally is expected to be financed from a nonresident source. Such foreign investment may be given "approved status," which guarantees the right to repatriate dividends and capital. All capital outflows are subject to prior approval. Capital transfers by residents to finance direct investments require the specific permis- sion of the Reserve Bank of Fiji and are permitted only where benefits will accrue to Fiji within a reasonably short period. Authority is delegated to banks operating in Fiji to approve transactions involving F$50,000 or more arising from (1) the conversion of foreign currency into Fiji currency, whether for credit to a resident account or to an External Account and (2) the crediting of an External Account with Fiji currency emanating from another External Account (including Fiji currency accounts of overseas banks). The banks must send confirmation of such inflows to the Reserve Bank; they must also have the approval of the Bank before granting any loans in excess of F$l0,000 to a company or branch in Fiji (other than a bank) which is controlled directly or indirectly by persons resident outside Fiji or by individuals designated as nonresidents; however, the banks do not need such approval to lend up to F$l0,000 to individual nonresi- dent customers who must repay such loans prior to their departure from Fiji. The banks may not lend foreign currency to any resident of Fiji without the specific FIJI permission of the Reserve Bank of Fiji. Residents require permission from the Reserve Bank of Fiji before they may borrow foreign currency w i th in Fiji or outside. The transfer of inheritances and dowries due to nonresidents is permitted, as is the transfer of the proceeds from the sale of a house owned by a nonresi- dent. Residents of Fiji are allowed to make cash gifts to nonresidents equivalent to F$500 a donor a year; additional funds are permitted in compassionate cases. Emigrants may take out their entire net assets on departure. With the prior approval of the Reserve Bank, residents are permitted to purchase foreign currency up to a maximum of F$5,000 a family a year to acquire foreign currency securities. The purchase of personal real prop- erty outside Fiji is not permitted. Special tax incentives are granted for investments in the tourist industry, and an investment allowance similar to that for the hotel industry is provided for large outlay investment projects supportive of the tourist industry. Portfolio investment in Fiji by nonresidents requires approval by the Reserve Bank; the proceeds of the sale or realization of such investment may be repatriated. Banks require exchange control permission to borrow abroad; they may accept deposits from nonresidents. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold coin in Fiji but not gold bullion. The export of gold coin, except numismatic coins and collectors' pieces, requires the specific permission of the Reserve Bank of Fiji. Gold imports from all sources, other than imports of gold coin, require a specific import license issued by the Ministry of Finance; these are restricted to authorized gold dealers. Gold coin is free of customs duty and fiscal tax, while gold bullion is exempt from customs duty but is subject to a fiscal tax of 7.5 percent. Gold jewelry is subject to a fiscal duty of 10 percent but does not require any license when valued at less than F$200; samples of gold and gold jewelry sent by foreign manufacturers require import licenses if over F$200 in value. Exports of gold jewelry do not require licenses and are free of export duty. All newly mined gold is sold in Australia at free market prices. Commemorative gold coins of F$100, F$200, and F$250 have been issued; these are legal tender but do not normally circulate. Changes During 1984 July 18-20. Following a devaluation of the New Zealand dollar, Fiji's dollar was allowed to depreciate by 2.47 percent against the basket of currencies used to determine its exchange rate. Imports and Import Payments April 13.

Not for Redistribution FINLAND (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Finland is the Finnish Markka. The external value of the markka is defined in terms of an index reflecting a weighted average of the exchange rates of the convertible currencies most important for Fin- land's foreign trade. These are defined as the convertible currencies of countries that have accounted for not less than 1 percent of Finland's commodity imports and exports in each of the preceding three calendar years. The value of the exchange rate index is maintained by the Suomen Pankki within a margin established by the Cabinet; since January 1984 the range has been 101.3- 106.0 (1982 = 100). The actual level of the index has been 102.5 since March 1984. The index weights are adjusted quarterly and based on the average trade shares for the past two years; the base year is changed annually. The Suomen Pankki calculates and publishes the cur- rency index on a daily basis. Daily (noon) buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar, the intervention cur- rency, are quoted by the Suomen Pankki. On Decem- ber 31, 1984 the rates were Fmk 6.522 and Fmk 6.538 per US$1, respectively. The rates for the U .S. dollar are applicable also to clearing dollars. Buy ing and selling rates for the clearing ruble are based on the rates of the State Bank of the U .S .S .R. for the U .S. dollar against the ruble. Quotations for other currencies are based on market cross rates. There are no exchange taxes or subsidies. Authorized banks may deal among themselves, with residents, and with nonresident banks in U .S. dollars and other convertible currencies. Forward premiums and discounts quoted by authorized banks reflect interest rate differences in various currencies. Finland formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2 , 3, and 4, of the Fund's Articles of Agreement, as from September 25, 1979. Administration of Control The Suomen Pankki operates the exchange control system, delegating authority to the authorized exchange dealers (mainly commercial banks). Import and export licensing is administered by the Export and Import Permits Office (a unit subordinate to the Ministry of Trade and Industry), which is headed by a Board composed of government officials, including a represen- tative of the Suomen Pankki. Prescription of Currency For prescription of currency purposes, countries are divided into two groups: the bilateral countries1 and the Finland maintains bilateral payments agreements w i th Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Poland, and the U .S .S .R. Transactions with Czechoslovakia and Poland have, however, been settled in freely convertible U.S. dollars since 1970 under agreements reached separately for each year. Under an agree- ment made in 1983, transactions w i th Czechoslovakia during 1984 and 1985 can be settled in any convertible currency. convertible currency countries (all others). Settlements with the bilateral countries must be made in the currency of the agreement (the clearing ruble for the U .S .S .R ., the clearing U .S. dollar for Hunga ry2 and Bulgaria ,3 and the clearing Finnish markka for the German Democratic Republic). Settlements with the convertible currency countries may be made in any convertible currency or through Convertible Accounts. Nonresident Accounts There are three categories of nonresident accounts: Convertible Accounts, Restricted Accounts, and Capital Accounts. Convertible Accounts are held by nonresidents in Finnish markkaa or in convertible currencies. These accounts may be credited by an authorized bank with amounts transferred from other Convertible Accounts, with Finnish currency received directly from a foreign bank or imported into Finland, with amounts which the bank would be authorized to transfer abroad, with amounts of convertible currency received by the bank, and with interest accrued on funds held in the accounts. These accounts may be debited freely and balances may be transferred abroad to any country. Restricted Accounts are held by residents of countries with which Finland has bilateral payments arrangements, and are designated according to the holder's country of residence. They may be held in Finnish markkaa or the appropriate bilateral payments agreement currency. They may be credited by an authorized bank with amounts transferred from Convertible Accounts and from Restricted Accounts related to the same country. The accounts may also be credited with Finnish currency received from a bank in the country indicated on the account, with amounts which the bank is authorized to receive to the credit of a Restricted Account related to the country indicated on the account, with currency surrendered to the bank and restricted to the country indicated on the account, and with interest accrued on funds held in the accounts. These accounts may be debited freely and balances may be transferred to the bilateral country concerned. Capital Accounts comprise all other nonresident ac- counts. They are held in markkaa and are intended primarily for payments of a capital nature. The assign- ment of a Capital Account to another nonresident and the transfer abroad of funds held in such an account may be effected (with some minor exceptions) only with the permission of the Suomen Pankki. A monetary institu- tion may credit a Capital Account with the purchase 2By agreement between the two countries, F in land's bilateral clearing arrangement w i th Hungary was terminated on January 31, 1985. 3 Beginning from April 1, 1985, the currency of payments in transactions w i th Bulgaria is to be the clearing Finnish markka. 201 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FINLAND price of assets other than foreign securities bought from the holder by a resident, w i th funds received as an inheritance, and w i th redemption payments and interest on matured bonds and debentures quoted on the Helsinki Stock Exchange. These accounts may also be credited with rent on property owned in Finland by the holder of the account, with proceeds from other assets belonging to the holder of the account and managed by the monetary institution with which the account is held, with the amount of a loan based on a contract granting to a nonresident a loan not exceeding Fmk 50,000 in value to be utilized in Finland, and w i th interest accrued on funds held in the account. Capital Accounts may be debited freely for noncom- mercial current expenses in Finland of and for account of the holder, and funds in Capital Accounts may be used for capital payments when the transaction does not require authorization or is authorized for transferable funds. The Suomen Pankki generally grants permission for transfer abroad of funds deposited in Capital Ac- counts to an account holder who has resided abroad during the last calendar year and who continues to do so. Imports and Import Payments Most goods may be imported free of license from the multilateral countries, provided that the goods are purchased from and originate in those countries. How- ever, certain goods4 may be imported from the multila- teral area under a global quota system, which provides for import licenses to be issued at least up to the amounts of quotas for specified commodity groups. The only commodities still subject to restrictions for the multila- teral area are certain agricultural commodities and fuels and petroleum products. With the exception of the commodities to which reference was made in the preceding paragraph, import licenses are not required for most commodities originat- ing in and purchased from the U .S .S .R ., or originating in and purchased from the five countries with which agreements on the reciprocal removal of obstacles to trade have been concluded (Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, and Po- land). All imports of commodities originating in coun- tries or areas not classified5 in either the multilateral area or the bilateral area require individual licenses. The State Granary is the main agency for the import of wheat, rye, barley, oats, and products of these grains for human consumption, but individual importers may also import these commodities under license. There is a state monopoly for imports of alcoholic beverages. Exchange is granted by authorized banks for all permitted imports on presentation of an application form, the import license (when required for imports from countries with nonconvertible currencies), and the ori- 4Agr icu l tural commodities, f i sh, fuels and other petroleum prod- ucts, and unw rought gold and silver. 5Curren t ly Taiwan (see Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part Two, page 54) and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 202 ginal commercial invoice, provided that the goods are already in the country or there is suff ic ient evidence to guarantee their importation. Payment for imports must be made w i th in 12 months after the date of customs clearance of the goods; if the period of suppliers' credit exceeds 6 months, the credit is subject to an "overtime fee," unless specially authorized by the Suomen Pankki; if the import payment is made to the seller through foreign financing credit, the credit period may not exceed 6 months without a special permit. The Suomen Pankki applies quotas w i th in which the banks can negotiate credits from foreign banks to finance imports. Payments for Invisibles Payments in respect of authorized invisible transac- tions are not restricted. The authorized banks have general permissionto effect paymentsfor most current invisibles, with a few exceptions relating to insurance, subject in some cases to a maximum allowance or other conditions; for amounts in excess of the standard allowances and for purposes for which no standard allowances have been set, exchange licenses are granted freely by the Suomen Pankki. All contracts involving payments to nonresidents for which general permission has not been granted must be submitted to the Suomen Pankki for approval. For minor payments, authorized banks may provide foreign exchange equivalent to Fmk 5,000 a calendar month for each remitter. A Finnish resident traveling abroad may purchase from commercial banks foreign exchange equivalent to Fmk 10,000 a trip, or, in the case of business travel, any amount made available by a bank for that purpose. Once abroad a traveler may withdraw foreign exchange on a bank account passbook or check issued by a Finnish monetary institution, provided that the utilized amount of his travel allocation does not exceed a total of Fmk 10,000. A resident traveler may use a credit card abroad without a limit on amount for travel services and settle the transaction after his return. A credit card may also be used to buy merchandise, provided that the purchase price of each such item does not exceed Fmk 10,000. Nonresident travelers may take out Fmk 10,000 a trip in Finnish notes and coin and any amount in Finnish or foreign notes and coin declared upon entry; resident travelers may take out foreign or domestic currency, or any combination of these, up to Fmk 10,000, or in the case of business travel any amount purchased for that purpose. For all types of travel, bona fide applications for additional amounts of foreign exchange are approved by the Suomen Pankki. Exports and Export Proceeds Sales of arms are strictly controlled. Exports to countries that are not in the convertible area and that are outside the scope of agreements on the reciprocal removal of obstacles to trade are allocated by means of bilateral trade arrangements. Foreign exchange acquired through commodity exports need not be surrendered to the Suomen Pankki or to an authorized exchange dealer. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Exporters are required to repatriate foreign exchange proceeds within eight days of collection, which may then be held in a foreign currency account with an authorized bank in Finland or be converted into domestic currency. Export licenses are required only for exports of scrap metal. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange receipts from current invisibles need not be surrendered but must be repatriated within eight days of collection. The funds may be held in a foreign currency account in Finland. Any unutilized foreign bank notes and traveler's checks must be repatriated, but these are exempt from the repatriation requirement up to Fmk 5,000 for assets held in Finland. The import of domestic and foreign currency and coin is unrestricted. Capital Most outward transfers of nonresident capital are subject to approval by the Suomen Pankki. Inheritances are transferred automatically to the beneficiaries. Per- sons who have resided outside Finland during the last calendar year and continue to do so are allowed to transfer abroad their assets in Finland in one lump sum, subject to the prior approval of the Suomen Pankki. Nonresidents may purchase bonds, debentures, or shares quoted on the Helsinki Stock Exchange through an authorized bank, against convertible currencies, or by debiting a Convertible Account. When the securities so acquired by a nonresident are deposited in the custody of the authorized bank, the nonresident purchaser is per- mitted to sell the securities on the Helsinki Stock Exchange through the authorized bank and to repatriate the proceeds of the sale in a convertible currency. The acquisition of shares, bonds, and debentures quoted on the Helsinki Stock Exchange with funds from Capital Accounts is also permitted automatically if they are acquired by an authorized bank, but proceeds from the sale of such securities may not be transferred abroad without the permission of the Suomen Pankki. Any other transactions in securities, and the export of securities that involve nonresident interests, require approval. If the securities were acquired with convertible foreign ex- change or with markkaa from a Convertible Account, approval for their export can be obtained freely. Inward direct investments that involve participation of more than 20 percent in the share capital of a Finnish enterprise require the approval of the Council of State. Such approval is usually granted, with the exception of investments in the forest and mining industries and in certain traditionally regulated activities. The transfer of direct investment capital needs authorization by the Suomen Pankki. Such authorization is usually granted by the Bank, if the underlying investment has been ap- proved by the Council of State. Repatriation of direct investment is subject to the approval of the Suomen Pankki, which is freely given. Outward transfers of FINLAND capital, including transfers of direct investment by residents, require individual approval by the Suomen Pankki. Proceeds from the sale of securities and real property must be repatriated under the general rule of repatriation. Subject to certain regulations, authorized banks and insurance companies have permission to purchase foreign and Finnish securities issued abroad. Purchases of real estate abroad are authorized up to a limit of Fmk 300,000 a person, subject to the approval of the Suomen Pankki, which is granted liberally. The upper limit on shares entitling part-time use of a second house abroad is Fmk 300,000. Finnish emigrants are generally permitted an exchange allowance of up to Fmk 300,000 a person or, in the case of emigrating families, Fmk 150,000 a person in addition to the basic tourist travel allowance. There is an automatic exchange allowance of up to Fmk 10,000 a calendar year for each donor for gifts and contributions to nonresidents. Foreign currency borrowing by Finnish residents, particularly in the form of short-term or long-term financial credits, including bond issues abroad, requires the specific approval of the Suomen Pankki, which exercises surveillance over the amount of capital inflow as well as the terms and timing. Lending to nonresidents other than in the case of syndicated bank loans is generally restricted to export credits. No permission is needed for customary export credits. Medium-term and long-term borrowing abroad, other than borrowing by the State or in the form of import credits, is in some cases subject to deposit requirements by the Suomen Pankki, which also sets the terms for such loans. Gold Residents may freely hold, buy, and sell gold in any form in Finland. Imports of unwrought gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Export and Import Permits Office; such licenses are not nor- mally granted except for imports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. The global quota list contains a quota for industrial gold, for which licenses are granted freely. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement January 1. The composition of the official currency index was changed to include only convertible currencies important to Finland's foreign trade; this involved the exclusion of the U .S .S .R. ruble and the distribution of its former weight proportionately among the other convertible currencies in the basket. In addition, the weights for calculating the currency index were rede- fined as the trade weights in a recent period, in contrast to the previous weight structure using trade shares largely reflecting a fixed base (1974). Henceforth, the index base would be adjusted each year to a new base calculated by using the average exchange rates for the two preceding calendar years. 203 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FINLAND March 21. The weights for 6 of the 12 currencies in Finland's currency index were revised. March 27. The index level for the markka was revised upward by 1.0 percent to 102.5, with the currency index band remaining unchanged. Nonresident Accounts January 1. The limit of loans to nonresidents against property in Finland was raised from Fmk 50,000 to Fmk 250,000; such loans continued to be required to be utilized in Finland. Payments for Invisibles January 1. The maximum amount of foreign exchange that could be freely exported or imported was raised from Fmk 5,000 to Fmk 10,000 a person a trip. In addition, the limit on outward transfers for minor payments was increased from Fmk 2,000 to Fmk 5,000. March 1. Authorization was granted for credit cards to be used abroad for purchases of goods (subject to a limit of Fmk 10,000 per item). Exports and Export Proceeds January 17. The Council of State decided that export deposits be collected as from January 20 on exports of pine sawn wood; the deposits should be made at the Suomen Pankki and would earn interest at an annual rate of 8.75 percent. June 5. The Council of State decided that export deposits would be collected on pulp exported between June 8, 1984 and June 7, 1985. November 1. The collection of export deposits on pine sawn wood was discontinued. Proceeds from Invisibles January 1. The provision prohibiting the import and the export of 500 markka notes was abolished. In addition, the limit on resident foreign exchange holdings not subject to obligatory repatriation was raised from Fmk 5,000 to Fmk 10,000. Capital January 1. The limit on the purchase of foreign exchange for the purchase of a second home abroad was raised from Fmk 250,000 to Fmk 300,000. January 1. The maximum amount of foreign exchange allowed to be taken out by individual Finnish emigrants was increased from Fmk 250,000 to Fmk 300,000. February 17. The upper limit on shares entitling part- time use of a second house abroad was raised from Fmk 75,000 to Fmk 300,000. 204 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FRANCE (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of France is the Franc. France partici- pates with Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Nether- lands in the exchange rate and intervention mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS). In accordance with this agreement, France maintains the spot exchange rates between the franc and the currencies of the other participants within margins of 2.25 percent (in the case of the Italian lira, 6 percent) above or below the cross rates based on the central rates expressed in European Currency Units (ECUs). The agreement implies that the Bank of France (the central bank) stands ready to buy or sell the currencies of the other participating states in unlimited amounts at specified intervention rates. On December 31, 1984 these rates were as follows: Specified Intervention Rates Per: 100 Belgian or Luxembourg francs 100 Danish kroner 100 deutsche mark 100 Netherlands guilders 100 Irish pounds 100 Italian lire Francs Upper limit Lower limit 15.6590 86.3650 313.6300 278.3500 968.8500 0.5201 14.9700 82.5650 299.8500 266.1000 926.2500 0.4613 The participants in the EMS are not maintaining the exchange rates for other currencies within fixed limits. However, in order to ensure a proper functioning of the system, they intervene in concert to smooth out fluctua- tions in exchange rates, the intervention currencies being each other's and the U.S. dollar. Buying and selling rates for 20 foreign currencies are quoted daily on the basis of market rates.1 On December 31, 1984 the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were F 9.58650 and F 9.59750, respectively, per US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Fixed conversion rates in terms of the franc apply to the currencies of the overseas territories and to the currencies of the countries that are linked to the French Treasury through an Operation Account2 as follows: (1) In the overseas territories of French Polynesia, New Caledonia, and Wallis and Futuna Islands, the currency 'Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Djibouti francs, Finnish markkaa, Greek drachmas, Irish pounds, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian knoner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, U .S. dollars, and zaires. 2Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo. used is the CFP franc, which has a fixed parity with the franc of CFPF 1 = F 0.055. (2) Fixed conversion rates in terms of the franc apply to the currencies of the Operations Account countries (see footnote 2). These rates are CFAF 1 = F 0.02 for the CFA franc, which circulates in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo. Authorized banks in France and in Monaco, which may also act on behalf of banks established abroad or in Operations Account countries, are permitted to deal spot or forward in the exchange market in France. Authorized banks may also deal spot and forward with their correspondents in foreign markets in all currencies. Nonbank residents may purchase foreign exchange for- ward in respect of specified transactions. Forward exchange cover is prohibited for term transactions on commodity markets; and forward cover in respect of spot transactions in commodities is limited to two days, with the obligation to redeem foreign exchange receipts after the eight-day period. France formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from February 15, 1961. Exchange Control Territory The exchange control regulations are applicable in all territories of the French Republic, that is, in continental France, Corsica, the Overseas Departments (Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana, Reunion, and St. Pierre and Miquelon), Mayotte, and the three Overseas Territories (Wallis and Futuna Islands, New Caledonia, and French Polynesia). No exchange control is applied in relation to Monaco or the Operations Account countries (see footnote 2); payments between France and these countries are free of restriction on the part of France and take place at fixed exchange rates. All other countries are considered foreign countries for exchange control purposes; all payments between France and foreign countries are subject to exchange control. For imports and exports of gold, the Operations Account countries are also considered foreign countries. The exchange control regulations include controls over inward and outward direct investment and other borrowing abroad on the basis of Decree No. 68-1021, of November 24, 1968. This decree is applicable to financial relations with all countries except those belong- ing to the French Franc Zone (i.e., Operations Account countries). Certain exchange operations are free from any prior authorization; these include direct investment coming from and going to EC countries, which are nevertheless submitted to prior notification. 205 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FRANCE Administration of Control The Directorate of the Treasury of the Ministry of Economy, Finance, and the Budget is the coordinating agency for financial relations with foreign countries. It is responsible for exchange control and all matters relating to inward and outward direct investment and to borrow- ing abroad, unless they relate to real estate companies, in which case the Bank of France screens applications. The Directorate of the Treasury also evaluates the balance of payments, together with the Bank of France, which collects the data for its compilation. Certain exchange control powers have been delegated to the Bank of France, including the authority to license imports and exports of gold. Other exchange control powers have been delegated to the Directorate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes and, in the Overseas Departments and Territories, to the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE). The Directorate of Insurance of the Ministry of Economy, Finance, and the Budget has certain powers in respect of matters relating to insurance, reinsurance, annuities, etc. The execution of all transfers has been delegated to authorized banks and stockbrokers and to the Postal Administration. The Directorate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes establishes import and export procedures and controls, within the framework of commercial policy directives given by the Directorate of Foreign Economic Relations (DREE); the Directorate- General also issues import and export licenses, and is responsible for any litigation relating to the exchange regulations. Technical visas required for certain imports and exports are issued by the appropriate ministry or by the Directorate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes. The Ministry of Industry has certain responsibilities in respect of licensing contracts and contracts relating to technical assistance. Prescription of Currency Settlements with the Operations Account countries may be made in francs or the currency issued by any institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury.3 Settlements with all other countries may be made in any of the currencies of those countries or through nonresident Foreign Accounts in Francs. Importers and exporters are free to invoice in any currency. Nonresident Accounts A nonresident account in francs may be freely opened by an authorized bank for nonresidents, including French nationals (other than officials) who have been residing abroad for at least two years. All overdrafts and advances on nonresident-held franc accounts are subject to general or specific permission. Foreign Accounts in Francs may be freely credited with (1) the franc proceeds of the spot or forward sale of foreign currencies on the exchange market by a nonresi- dent; (2) the franc proceeds of the sale of foreign bank notes to an authorized bank by a nonresident bank or a traveler; (3) the franc equivalent of an authorized bank's arbitrage in foreign currencies on a foreign market; (4) French bank notes (and those of the Operations Account countries) mailed direct from abroad to the main office of the Bank of France by an authorized bank's foreign correspondents; (5) transfers from other Foreign Accounts in Francs; (6) any authorized payment by a resident to a nonresident, including interest on balances in Foreign Accounts in Francs; (7) the pro- ceeds, income, and amortization from French and foreign securities held in a foreign dossier in France, and the proceeds of the sale on a French stock exchange of securities denominated in French francs, including secu- rities held by authorized banks; (8) liquidation proceeds of nonresident-held direct investments;4 and (9) the proceeds of the sale, through the intermediation of a notary public, of nonresident-owned real estate to phys- ical or juridical persons of foreign nationality: should the nonresident be a French national, he or she must show proof that the property was originally purchased by debiting a foreign account or by inward transfer of foreign exchange. These accounts may be freely debited for (1) spot purchases of any foreign currency on the exchange market by a nonresident; (2) the purchase by a nonresi- dent of foreign bank notes or withdrawals in French bank notes; (3) the equivalent in francs of arbitrage abroad in foreign currencies by an authorized bank; (4) French bank notes (and those of Operations Account countries) mailed by authorized banks direct to their foreign correspondents; (5) transfers to other Foreign Accounts in Francs; (6) approved direct investment in France by nonresidents (see footnote 4); (7) purchases of real estate from residents, through the intermediation of a notary public; (8) purchases in France of listed French or foreign securities; (9) interest on and repayment of loans granted in accordance with the relevant regulations by residents; (10) any payment by a nonresident to a resident; and (11) repayment of consumer and real estate loans by French banks for foreigners living in France. If francs accruing to a nonresident are not transferable, or are not immediately transferable, they may be credited to a Suspense Account in Francs in the name of the beneficiary. The unremittable funds of emigrants of French nationality must be retained in resident accounts (comptes nonresident accounts. In addition, nonresidents may hold foreign currency accounts with French and foreign- owned banks. Imports and Import Payments Goods originating in and shipped from other countries that are accorded privileged treatment in respect of trade transactions (see section on Exchange Control Territory, above) are generally admitted free of quantitative restric- tions and individual licenses. Imports of goods that originate in other countries and are not covered by French import liberalization require individual licenses. Some imports from non-EC countries are subject to minimum prices; these require an administrative visa and sometimes, exceptionally, an import license. Certain imports require certificates of origin. For import control purposes, countries other than those that are accorded privileged treatment are divided into four groups according to the extent of import liberalization: (1) the former OEEC countries, their dependent territories and certain former dependent ter- ritories, Andorra, Canada, Egypt, Ethiopia, Fiji, Fin- land, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Liberia, Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic, the United States, Western Samoa, and Yugoslavia; (2) some specified countries;5 (3) the Eastern European countries (Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the U .S .S .R .), the People's Republic of China, the Demo- cratic People's Republic of Korea, and Mongolia; and (4) the German Democratic Republic. Goods covered by the import liberalization arrangements applicable to one country may be imported freely from another country, provided that the country of origin and the country of shipment both benefit from the same degree of liberalization. Imports of practically all industrial products from countries in group (1) are free of quantitative restric- tions, but restrictions are applied to a number of agricultural and electronic products; there is relatively little difference between the lists of goods which may be imported freely from different countries in this group. Imports of certain industrial products from countries in group (2) are restricted, and restrictions are applied to these and to certain additional industrial products from group (3) countries. For some commodities, there are global quotas that are allocated annually (petroleum and petroleum products) or semiannually and apply to all countries (other than those that have bilaterally negotiated quotas or receive privileged treatment). Im- ports from all countries of certain agricultural items and certain raw materials are free of quantitative restrictions. 5 Afghanistan, Argentina, Australia, Bhutan, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Japan, Republic of Korea, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Mexico, Nepal, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Uruguay, Venezuela, Yemen Arab Republic, and People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. FRANCE Imports from non-EC countries of most products covered by the Common Agricultural Policy of the EC are subject to variable import levies that have replaced all previous barriers to imports; common EC regulations are also applied to imports from non-EC countries of most other agricultural and livestock products. Liberalized imports are not subject to trade controls, but do require a customs document that constitutes the customs declaration. However, as an exchange control measure, the domiciliation (registration) of the import transaction at an authorized bank may be prescribed. For some liberalized imports, an administrative visa issued by the Central Customs Administration or by the appropriate ministry is required on an import declara- tion. Imports of the products of the European Coal and Steel Community require such administrative visas when originating in non-ECSC countries. Other imports generally require individual import licenses. These are granted up to quotas determined on an individual commodity basis or for a group of commodities and are applicable to specified countries or areas in accordance with trade agreements or an import plan drawn up for a definite period. Imports of some products must pass through designated customs offices. Documents accompanying goods passing through cus- toms must be written or translated into French. Payments for imports from foreign countries must be made by credit to a Foreign Account in Francs or with foreign currency purchased in the French exchange market. Import transactions relating to foreign countries and valued at F 250,000 or more must be domiciled with an authorized bank, to which the necessary import documents must be presented and through which all payments related to the import must be made. The amounts that may be transferred through postal channels are not subject to limitation, but in practice, the Postal Administration does not make import payments valued at over F 250,000, as it does not undertake domiciliation. Authorized banks may without special authorization permit advance payments to be made that are provided for in the commercial contract, up to 30 percent of the price for capital goods and up to 10 percent for all other goods. Higher advance payments require prior approval by the Customs Administration. For all imports, import- ers may purchase spot foreign currency two working days before utilization; utilization cannot take place before the payment falls due. There is no restriction on the use of suppliers' credit. Forward cover for import payments is limited to specified commodities: namely, green coffee, rice, hides and skins, hairs, wool, cotton, and cotton waste. Forward cover must not exceed three months6 and must be carried out in the currency stipulated in the contract and be terminated not later than the day of the settlement; should settlement be effected 6 As a means of facilitating the use of the ECU in external commercial transactions, the French authorities on March 2, 1985, granted permission for importers to make forward purchases of ECUs for a period of up to six months for the purposes of import payments and related charges invoiced in ECUs. 207 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FRANCE before the expiration of three months, the operation must be canceled for the remaining period. If the settlement of the contract is deferred, the forward covering can be extended for a maximum of eight days without prior authorization. In cases where the contract is canceled, the covering operation must be terminated immediately. If the cancellation results in a foreign exchange profit, the bank involved must inform the Bank of France. Payments for Invisibles Payments for current invisibles to foreign countries are controlled but are not restricted as to amount. If justifying documents are presented and certain exchange control requirements are met, authorized banks are permitted to approve applications for payments for many categories of current invisibles without any limitation; for certain other categories of current invisibles, estab- lished limits have been set. Applications for all other payments for invisibles and for amounts in excess of established limits are referred to the Bank of France to prevent unauthorized capital transfers; such applications are approved if a genuine current payment is involved. Any resident may make remittances abroad up to the equivalent of F 1,500 a person each month, provided that the transfers do not serve as a means of accumulating funds abroad. Outward remittances for family support abroad are limited to the equivalent of F 3,000 a person a month; transfers in excess of this amount require the approval of the Bank of France or the CCCE. Transfers of donations to nonresidents are subject to authorization by the Bank of France. Payments that may be authorized without limitation by authorized banks include those related to approved trade transactions; income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties; banking commis- sions, patent fees, and specified categories of taxes; specified insurance payments; fees to medical doctors, lawyers, etc.; alimony in accordance with court deci- sions; and net salaries or wages of foreigners employed in France, provided that the transfer takes place within three months from the date of payment. Irrespective of the exchange control regulations, cer- tain transactions between persons or firms in France and abroad are subject to restriction; these include certain transactions relating to insurance, reinsurance, and road and river transport. The basic exchange allocation for tourist travel to foreign countries by residents (defined for this purpose as including residents of Operations Account countries) is the equivalent of F 5,000 a person a trip, which may be taken up for any number of trips a year. The basic allocation for business travel is the same plus the equivalent of F 1,000 a person a day in French francs or foreign currency. Applications for exchange in excess of the basic allowance for business travel may be approved by the Bank of France or the CCCE, provided that no capital outflow is involved. Any unutilized foreign currency in excess of the equivalent of F 1,000 must be surrendered within one month upon return to France. 208 Applications for travel exchange cannot be submitted earlier than one month before departure. Resident travelers may freely take out the equivalent of F 5,000 in means of payments acquired in the exchange market against a tourist travel allocation. Nonresident travelers may not, in principle, take out more than the equivalent of F 5,000 in foreign bank notes, unless these were declared upon entry and the amount to be taken out does not exceed that imported minus any amounts exchanged for francs plus any reconversion of francs into foreign currencies. However, nonresident travelers may freely take out any other means of payment established in their name abroad; in addition, subject to the submission of an authorized bank's declaration, they may take out any amount in foreign bank notes or foreign currency traveler's checks acquired in France from an authorized bank by conver- sion of foreign exchange in the French exchange market, by debit to a Foreign Account in Francs, or by debit to a foreign currency account. Resident travelers to foreign countries may take out F 5,000 in French bank notes. These bank notes may be used abroad, and any amount taken out is charged against the basic exchange allocation of F 5,000. Nonresident travelers may take out F 5,000 in French bank notes and may reconvert into foreign currency in the French exchange market any French bank notes up to F 5,000 obtained by the conversion in that market of foreign means of payment that they declared upon entry or obtained by debit to a Foreign Account in Francs; any remaining French bank notes must be deposited with the customs against issuance of a receipt. Exports and Export Proceeds Certain goods on a prohibited export list may be exported only under a special license. Some other exports also require individual licenses, but if the total value does not exceed F 1,000 (F 5,000 for art objects or collectors' items), these exports may be permitted without any formality, subject to certain exceptions. Exports to foreign countries are subject to exchange control. Payment must be received through the exchange market. The repatriation7 and, where appropriate, the surrender by sale in the exchange market of proceeds from exports to foreign countries are required not later than 15 days from export deliveries. Small business exporters may be authorized by the Bank of France to spend locally up to 5 percent of export receipts or F 30,000 a month (whichever is higher) held in foreign currency accounts. Authorized banks may freely extend foreign currency advances to exporters; such advances and their repayment may be settled in the exchange market, as may the proceeds from the discounting of foreign currency drafts presented by exporters. The due date of the commercial contract may not be more than 180 days after arrival of the goods at their destination, 7 Repatriation may take place either by collection of foreign currency or by debit to a Foreign Account in Francs. ©International Monetary Fund.

The transfer abroad of nonresident-owned funds, including the sales proceeds of capital assets, is not restricted. French and foreign securities held in France by nonresidents may be exported, provided that they have been deposited with an authorized bank in a foreign dossier (dossier etranger de valeurs except with special authorization or when a guarantee by the Compagnie Franchise cT Assurance pour le Com- merce ExteYieur (COFACE) has been obtained. For values exceeding the equivalent of F 50,000, export proceeds must not be received in French or foreign bank notes or bank notes issued by an institute of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, or by debit to a postal checking account in France; export proceeds from F 50,000 to F 150,000 may be received in checks drawn on a bank account maintained abroad or on a foreign bank account opened in France and those above F 150,000 must be received Jby transfer; in addition, for such amounts, exporters are from the date of shipment to sell on a spot or forward basis 90 percent of the foreign currency proceeds from exports. All export transactions related to foreign coun- tries and valued at F 250,000 or more must be domiciled with an authorized bank; the Director-General of Cus- toms and Indirect Taxes, however, may exempt certain approved firms from domiciliation requirements. Certain goods purchased in France by persons not normally residing in France are considered as exports, even when paid for in francs, and are exempt from taxes. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with Monaco and the Operations Account countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets (with the exception of income from work in border areas) must be repatriated and, where appropriate, surrendered within one month from the due date and in any case within eight working days of receipt. With minor exceptions for certain types of transactions, services performed for nonresidents do not require licenses. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin (except gold coin) in francs, CFA francs, CFP francs, or any foreign currency; however, the exchange of bank notes issued by Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia is prohibited at the request of those countries. Resident travelers must sell in the exchange market any foreign bank notes or traveler's checks in excess of F 1,000 within a month of entry. Capital Capital movements between France and Monaco and the Operations Account countries are free of exchange control; capital transfers between France and all other countries are subject to exchange control approval. With the exception of purchases of French and foreign securities abroad, outward transfers of resident-owned capital generally are restricted; capital receipts from foreign countries are permitted freely, provided that the foreign exchange proceeds are surrendered by sale in the exchange market (but see below for special controls over borrowing abroad and over inward direct investment). Capital assets abroad of residents are not subject to repatriation. Outward remittance of funds for the FRANCE any prior authorization; these include direct investment coming from and going to EC countries, which are nevertheless submitted to prior notification. Foreign direct investments in France and French direct investments abroad, including loans constituting a direct investment, require prior declaration to the Minister of Economy, Finance, and the Budget. Direct investments are defined as investments leading to control of a company or enterprise. Any participation exceeding 20 percent of the capital is considered as direct invest- ment. A participation that does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a firm whose shares are quoted on the stock exchange is not considered as direct investment. To determine whether a company is foreign controlled, the Treasury may take also into account any special relation- ships resulting from such factors as stock options, patents and licenses, and commercial contracts. Foreign companies controlled by EC residents are free to estab- lish a subsidiary and to take over any participation in the equity capital of a French company within one month (for establishments and participations under F 5 million) or two months (for other operations). Foreign companies controlled by other nonresidents may establish a sub- sidiary or take over any participation under F 5 million in a French company, within one month following the declaration, unless the Minister of Economy, Finance, and the Budget decides to postpone the operation; such a decision is highly exceptional. Whatever the nationality of a nonresident investor, the Treasury is, however, entitled to issue a finding within one month to forbid such an establishment or participation, should it be deemed to jeopardize public health, order, security, or defense. Takeovers of French companies by non-EC residents amounting to more than F 5 million,10 as well as changes in shareholders' ownership percentage of any foreign-controlled corporation, require an authorization. Exemptions from declaration or approval requirements are granted for increases of equity capital of a subsidiary by the parent company and for loans granted by a parent company to its subsidiary provided that (a) the interest charges are at a normal market rate, (b) there is a defined schedule of repayment, and (c) each drawing remains outstanding for at least one year. The liquidation proceeds of foreign direct investment in France may be freely transferred abroad; the liquidation itself must be reported to the Minister within 20 days of its occurrence. If the amount involved is more than F 1 million, documentary evidence must be submitted in advance to the Directorate of the Treasury. With the exception of those specifically exempted (such as investments by small and medium-size enterprises—i.e., those with a turnover of less than F 350 million each), 75 percent of direct investment abroad must be financed by borrowing in foreign currency. A lower foreign financing require- ment of 50 percent applies in the case of direct 10 On February 25, 1985, the threshold value beyond which foreign investments in France become subject to prior authorization was raised from F 5 million to F 10 million. 210 investment in EC member countries. Such loans must have an initial maturity of at least two years, and cannot be repaid in advance without authorization. Direct investment abroad by residents is exempt from prior declaration or prior authorization when the amount involved does not exceed F 2 million a year for each beneficiary firm abroad, and provided that the transac- tions do not involve holding companies, investment companies, investment trusts, unit trusts, mutual funds, or companies whose purpose is to facilitate the financing or treasury functions of enterprises belonging to one or more groups, as well as the financing of investments in agriculture and real estate. The liquidation of direct investment abroad is free from any prior application, provided that the corresponding funds are repatriated to France in due time. Foreign issues on the French capital market are subject to prior authorization by the Minister of Economy, Finance, and the Budget. The requirement is applicable also to the Operations Account countries. Exempt from authorization, however, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the French Government and (2) shares similar to securities that already are officially quoted on a stock exchange in France. Borrowing abroad by physical or juridical persons, whether public or private persons, whose normal resi- dence or registered office is in France, or by branches or subsidiaries in France of juridical persons whose regis- tered office is abroad, requires prior authorization by the Minister of Economy, Finance, and the Budget. The following types of borrowing are, in principle, exempt from this authorization: (1) borrowing by industrial firms for the execution of works abroad; (2) borrowing by any type of firm to finance imports or exports of goods; (3) loans related to certain international merchanting transactions; (4) borrowing related to the performance of services (other than income from labor or capital), when undertaken to finance operations executed abroad or transactions with foreign countries; (5) loans contracted by banks expressly permitted to borrow abroad (these include all authorized banks); and (6) foreign currency borrowing abroad by nonbank firms, when the total amount outstanding of these loans does not exceed F 50 million for any one borrower, provided that the interest rate is a "normal" market rate, that the foreign exchange proceeds are surrendered, and that each draw- ing against the loan is separated by at least one year from the corresponding repayment. All borrowings in Euro- francs are subject to prior authorization. The application of the controls over direct investment and borrowing is delegated to the Bank of France insofar as they relate to French firms that are mainly engaged in real estate business. Lending abroad is subject only to exchange control authorization by the Bank of France, within the framework of directives issued by the Treasury. Since the imposition of exchange control in 1968, authorized banks have been virtually free to lend foreign currency to ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution nonresidents, subject to certain reservations in respect of the granting of guarantees and varying limitations on their external position, and to resident importers and exporters. Lending to nonresidents in francs, however, is prohibited, with minor exceptions. Authorized banks' foreign currency assets and their overall liabilities in francs and foreign currency to nonresidents are free from limitation. Nonresidents may freely purchase French short-term securities, including treasury bills, bons de caisse, and private drafts. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire regularly, and dispose of gold in any form in France. They may continue to hold abroad any gold they held there prior to November 25, 1968. There is a free gold market for bars and coin in Paris, to which residents have free access and in which normally no official intervention takes place. Imports and exports of "monetary" gold (defined as gold having a fineness or a weight that is recognized in the gold market) into or from the territory of continental France require prior authorization by the Bank of France. Imports or exports to or from the Bank of France itself, however, are exempted from that requirement. Imports and exports by private persons of gold objects (other than medals and bars, but including both personal and other jewelry) or numismatic gold coins, provided that their combined weight does not exceed 500 grams, are similarly exempt. Movements of industrial gold are subject to a simple declaration as are imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold, such as gold-filled and gold-plated articles. Collec- tors' items of gold and gold antiques are subject to specific regulations. A 20-franc gold coin, the napoleon, is traded on the Paris stock exchange. In domestic trading, purchases of bars and coin are not subject to value-added tax. Imports of monetary gold are exempt from customs duty and value-added tax. Domestic transactions in gold and gold coin are subject to capital gains tax. Changes During 1984 Imports and Import Payments February 5.

Not for Redistribution GABON (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Gabon is the CFA Franc,1 which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. Exchange transac- tions in French francs between the BE AC and commer- cial banks at present take place at the rate of CFAF 50 = F 1. Buying and selling rates for certain foreign currencies are also officially posted, with quotations based on the fixed rate for the French franc and the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market, and include a commission. Commissions are charged at the rate of 0.25 percent on transfers made by the banks for their own accounts, and 0.225 percent on all private capital transfers to countries that are not members of the BEAC, except those made for the account of the Treasury, national accounting offices, national and international public agencies, and private entities granted exemption by the Ministry of Economy and Finance because of the nature of their activities. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of those relating to gold, Gabon's exchange control measures do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control The Directorate of Financial Institutions in the Minis- try of Economy and Finance supervises borrowing and lending abroad. Exchange control is administered by the Minister of Economy and Finance, who has delegated his approval authority for current payments to the authorized banks and that with respect to the external position of the banks to the BEAC. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be ef- fected through authorized intermediaries, that is, the Postal Administration and authorized banks. Import authorizations or licenses, and export authorizations, where necessary, are issued by the Directorate of External Trade of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Prescription of Currency Since Gabon is an Operations Account country, settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, !The CFA franc circulating in Gabon is issued by the Banque des Etats de FAfrique Centrale (BEAC) and is legal tender also in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, and the Congo. and the Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury. Settlements with all other countries are usually made through correspondent banks in France in any of the currencies of those countries or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. BEAC bank notes may be credited to Foreign Accounts in Francs when they have been mailed to the BEAC agency in Libreville by an authorized bank's foreign correspondent. Otherwise, the crediting to nonresident accounts of BEAC bank notes, French bank notes, or bank notes issued by any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury is prohibited. Imports and Import Payments In general, imports from member countries of the Central African Customs and Economic Union (UDEAC) are free of formalities; imports of refined vegetable oil from these countries require prior approval. All imports from countries outside the UDEAC are subject to either an authorization to import (when the value is more than CFAF 500,000) or a license to import. All imports, of any origin, are subject to authorization. For perishables and spare parts, a provi- sional authorization is given to avoid administrative delays. Imports from countries outside the UDEAC that are similar to, and compete with, domestic products are subject to licensing but, with a few exceptions,2 licenses are granted liberally in practice. Some imports are prohibited for security and health reasons. Imports of refined vegetable oil are suspended except when originating from member countries of the UDEAC. All imports of commercial goods must be insured through authorized insurance companies in Gabon. All import transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Authoriza- tions duly endorsed by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and the Ministry of Economy and Finance (Directorate of Financial Institutions) entitle importers to purchase the necessary foreign exchange provided that the shipping documents are submitted to the authorized bank. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to approval, which is granted when the appropriate docu- ments are submitted. For many types of payment the 2Cement, sugar, batteries, and refined vegetable oil. 213 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GABON approval authority has been delegated to authorized banks. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Trans- fers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted freely when the basic transaction has been approved. For tourist travel, residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may obtain an exchange allocation equivalent to CFAF 200,000 a person a trip (CFAF 100,000 for children under ten) for any number of trips a year; any foreign exchange remaining after return to Gabon must be surrendered. For business travel to foreign countries, there is a special allocation equiva- lent to CFAF 25,000 a day, subject to a maximum of CFAF 500,000 a trip. Tourist and business travel allocations may not be combined. Travelers to foreign countries may take out up to a maximum of CFAF 25,000 in BEAC bank notes; the amount taken out is not deducted from the travel allocation. Travelers to France, Monaco, and the other Operations Account countries may not export CFA or French bank notes in excess of an amount equivalent to CFAF 200,000 (CFAF 100,000 for children under ten) for tourist travel; for business travel the amount of such bank notes that may be carried out is the equivalent of CFAF 25,000 a day and CFAF 500,000 a trip. Transfers may be effected without limit through the banking or postal systems. Exports and Export Proceeds There are no general regulations concerning exports. Exports of refined petroleum products, cacao, coffee, and crocodile skins require authorization, irrespective of destination. Export transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Export proceeds received in currencies other than those of France or an Operations Account country must be surrendered. Ex- port proceeds normally must be received within 150 days after the arrival of the commodities at their destination. The proceeds must be collected and, if received in a foreign currency, surrendered within one month of the due date. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Ac- count countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be collected and, if received in foreign currency, be surrendered within a month of the due date. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BEAC, the Bank of France, or any other bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) of countries outside the French Franc Area. 214 Capital Capital movements between Gabon and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require the approval of the Directorate of Financial Institutions and are restricted, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. All foreign securities, foreign currency, and titles embodying claims on foreign countries or nonresidents that are held in Gabon by residents or nonresidents must be deposited with authorized banks in Gabon. Special controls (additional to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable) are maintained over borrowing and lending abroad, over inward and outward direct investment, and over the issuing, adver- tising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Gabon; these controls relate to the transactions themselves, not to payments or receipts. With the exception of controls over the sale or introduction of foreign securities in Gabon, the control measures do not apply to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries. Direct investments abroad3 must be declared to the Ministry of Economy and Finance unless they take the form of a capital increase resulting from reinvestment of undistributed profits; the full or partial liquidation of such investments also must be declared to the Ministry unless the operation involves the relinquishing of a participation that had previously been approved as constituting a direct investment abroad. Foreign direct investments in Gabon4 must be declared to the Ministry unless they take the form of a capital increase resulting from reinvestment of undistributed profits; within two months from receipt of the declaration, the Ministry may request the postponement of the project. The fu ll or partial liquidation of direct investments in Gabon must also be declared to the Ministry unless the operation involves the relinquishing of a participation that had previously been approved as constituting a direct invest- ment in Gabon. Both the making and the liquidation of direct investments, whether these are Gabonese invest- ments abroad or foreign investments in Gabon, must be reported to the Ministry within 20 days following each operation. Direct investments are defined as investments implying control of a company or enterprise. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Gabon requires prior authorization by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Exempt from autho- rization, however, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Gabonese Government and (2) shares similar to securities whose issue, advertising, or offering for sale in Gabon has previously been authorized. 3 Including those made through foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in Gabon and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Gabon. 4 Including those made by companies in Gabon that are directly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in Gabon of foreign companies. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Borrowing abroad by physical or juridical persons, whether public or private persons, whose normal resi- dence or registered office is in Gabon, or by branches or subsidiaries in Gabon of juridical persons whose regis- tered office is abroad, requires prior authorization by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans constituting a direct investment abroad for which prior approval has been obtained, as indicated above; (2) loans directly connected with the rendering of services abroad by the persons or firms mentioned above, or with the financing of commercial transactions either between Gabon and countries abroad or between foreign coun- tries, in which these persons or firms take part; (3) loans contracted by registered banks; and (4) loans other than those mentioned above, when the total amount outstand- ing does not exceed CFAF 50 million for any one borrower. The contracting of loans referred to under (4) that are free of authorization, and each repayment thereon, must be declared to the Directorate of Financial Institutions within 20 days of the operation, unless the total outstanding amount of all loans contracted abroad by the borrower is CFAF 5 million or less. Lending abroad by physical or juridical persons, whether public or private persons, whose normal resi- dence or registered office is in Gabon, or by branches or subsidiaries in Gabon of juridical persons whose regis- tered office is abroad, requires prior authorization by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans granted by registered banks and (2) other loans, when the total amount outstanding does not exceed CFAF 50 million for any one lender. The making of loans that are free of authorization, and each repayment thereon, must be declared to the Directorate of Financial Institutions within 20 days of the operation, except when the total GABON outstanding amount of all loans granted abroad by the lender does not exceed CFAF 5 million. Under the Investment Code of December 4, 1961, as amended on March 23, 1967 and July 9, 1971, any enterprise to be established in Gabon, whether domestic or foreign, is granted, under certain conditions, reduced duties and taxes on specified imports, as well as exemption from direct taxes on specified income. A minimum of 10 percent state participation is required for any enterprise located in Gabon. The Code provides for four categories of preferential treatment. In addition to fiscal privileges, eligible companies may receive protec- tion against foreign competition and may be given priority in the allocation of imports, of public credit, and of government contracts. A Presidential Decree of April 11, 1975 provides that foreign companies investing in Gabon must offer shares for purchase by Gabonese nationals. Non-Gabonese firms or individuals are not permitted to own land in Gabon. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Gabon. Imports and exports of gold require the authorization of the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles). The export of gold is the monopoly of the Societe Gabonaise de Recherches et d'Exploitation Minieres (SOGAREM). Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration.

The Central Bank of The Gambia deals in pounds sterling at the fixed rate of D 5 = £ stg. 1, subject to a commission of 0.0625 percent buying and 0.5 percent selling. The commercial banks deal with customers for spot transac- tions in sterling at rates within 1 percent of the Central Bank's fixed rate and in other currencies at rates determined by the prevailing market rate in London for the currency concerned against the pound sterling. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. There is a multiple currency practice associ- ated with a requirement that the domestic currency counterpart of all external payments arrears be placed in a Blocked Account at the Central Bank of The Gambia. Administration of Control Exchange control policy is determined by the Ministry of Finance and Trade. The day-to-day administration of exchange control is carried out by the Central Bank. The commercial banks, which have been appointed as autho- rized dealers, may authorize sales of foreign currencies for imports covered by specific licenses and, up to specified amounts, for travel expenses and sundry payments abroad. All other sales of foreign currencies are subject to authorization by the Central Bank. The Ministry of Finance and Trade is responsible for the issue of import and export licenses. Prescription of Currency Settlements with other countries may be made and received in dalasis or pounds sterling from nonresident sources or in any other currency. Settlements with the Central Bank of West African States (for Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Niger, Senegal, and Togo) and Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are normally made through the West African Clearing House. Nonresident Accounts Bank accounts held by authorized dealers in The Gambia on behalf of residents of other countries may be designated External Accounts. They may be credited with authorized payments from residents of other coun- tries, with transfers from other External Accounts, and with the proceeds of sales of other currencies. They may be debited for any payments to residents of other countries, for transfers to other External Accounts, and for purchases of other currencies. In addition, there is legal provision for authorized dealers to maintain Blocked Accounts under the direction of the Central Bank. 216 Imports and Import Payments Importation of certain specified goods is prohibited from all sources, predominantly for social or health reasons or on grounds of public policy. The import from any country of rice, sugar, and wheat flour is subject to specific licensing in order to ensure the adequacy of such imports and their fair domestic pricing. The Gambia Produce Marketing Board is responsible for rice imports. Except for imports from Eastern European countries, the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Japan, which are subject to specific licensing, all other imports are freely permitted under an open general license. Settlement for imports from Eastern European coun- tries may be approved by an authorized dealer on production of evidence of importation for any commod- ity that is covered by a valid specific import license. For imports that do not require specific licensing, payment authorization is given by the Central Bank on production of evidence of importation or shipment. Advance pay- ments for imports, whether or not these are covered by specific licenses, are approved by the Central Bank in all cases where the payment is considered genuine and in accordance with normal commercial practice. Payments for imports may be made in dalasis or sterling to an External Account or in any other currency. All goods are subject to an import tax of 4 percent of the c . i .f. value unless otherwise specified. Imports made by the Government, diplomatic missions, and charitable organizations are exempt. There have been some delays in import payments. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles in foreign currencies require permission from the Central Bank, with the exception that authorized dealers have been delegated powers to authorize travel expenses and sundry payments. Permis- sion is given in all genuine cases. Irrespective of the purpose of the journey, authorized dealers may grant a basic exchange allowance of up to D 750 a person a trip but not exceeding D 1,500 in any one calendar year for travel abroad. For business, professional, or official purposes, authorized dealers may provide residents with exchange facilities of up to D 1,750 for any one journey at a rate not exceeding D 125 a day, subject to a maximum of D 3,500 in any one calendar year. Any excess over these allowances requires permission from the Central Bank, but all such applications are approved, provided that no capital outflow is involved. Of the above amounts, up to D 250 may be taken out in foreign currency notes and coin. Irrespective of destination, a traveler leaving The Gambia may take out D 75 in Gambian or pound sterling currency notes. Visitors to ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution The Gambia may also take out with them on departure any other currency notes declared by them when entering the country. There have been some delays in service payments on external debt. Exports and Export Proceeds Because of domestic requirements, the export of charcoal and firewood is subject to specific licensing. The export of all other goods can generally be made without individual licensing, if settlement is made in accordance with procedures laid down by the Central Bank. The Gambia Produce Marketing Board is the sole exporter of groundnut products, oil palm kernels, cotton, and all derivatives of cotton. Payment for exports must be received through an authorized dealer within six months from the date of export in dalasis, or in pound sterling from an External Account, or in any other currency. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in foreign currencies must be offered for sale to authorized dealers. There is no restriction on the import of Gambian or other currency notes. Capital Inward transfers of capital are not controlled, but outward transfers are subject to control. At the time of making investments in The Gambia, nonresident inves- tors may apply for a clearance from the Central Bank to facilitate subsequent repatriation of capital; the remit- tance of profits is allowed freely after provision has been made for local taxes and other legally incurred liabilities in The Gambia. All other applications to transfer capital THE GAMBIA abroad are dealt with by the Central Bank. Loans and advances by the commercial banks to nonresidents are subject to the authorization of the Central Bank. Gold The import of gold coin minted in the United Kingdom requires licensing by the Ministry of Finance and Trade; otherwise, gold coin and bullion may be imported freely. All internal dealings in gold and the export of gold require the permission of the Central Bank. Neither the Central Bank nor the commercial banks deal in gold. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement February 25. The exchange rate of the dalasi was changed from D 4 = £ stg. 1 to D 5 = £ stg. 1, representing a devaluation of 25 percent. Imports and Import Payments July 1. The following changes in import policy came into effect: (a) the general import tax was increased from 3 x/2 percent to 4 percent; (b) import duties on petroleum products were increased from D 0.83 to D 1.16 per liter for premium gasojine, D 0.76 to D 1.09 per liter for gas oil, and D 0.70 to D 1.03 per liter for kerosene; and (c) import duties were raised for various other items, including cigarettes and manufactured tobacco, alcoholic beverages, passenger cars, and sugar and other food items. Exports and Export Proceeds July 1. Export duties on groundnut products were increased by 2 percentage points. 217 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Federal Republic of Germany is the Deutsche Mark. Germany1 participates with Bel- gium, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS), whereby each country maintains the value of its currency in relation to the currencies of the other participating countries. Under this agreement, spot exchange rates between the deutsche mark and the currencies of the other partici- pants are maintained within margins of 2.25 percent above or below the cross rates derived from the central rates expressed in European Currency Units (ECUs), except for the Italian lira for which the temporary intervention limit is plus or minus 6 percent. The agreement implies that the Deutsche Bundesbank (the central bank) stands ready to buy or sell the currencies of the other participating states in unlimited amounts at specified intervention rates. On Dec- ember 31, 1984 these rates were as follows: Specified Intervention Rates Per: 100 Belgian or Luxembourg francs 100 Danish kroner 100 French francs 1 Irish pound 1,000 Italian lire 100 Netherlands guilders Deutsche Mark Upper limit Lower limit 5.106 28.165 33.350 3.160 1.696 90.770 4.882 26.925 31.885 3.021 1.504 86.780 The participants in the EMS are not maintaining the exchange rates for other currencies within fixed limits. However, in order to ensure a proper functioning of the system, they intervene in concert with other participants to smooth out erratic fluctuations in exchange rates. In principle, interventions are made in participating curren- cies but they may also take place in third currencies, such as the U.S. dollar. Official middle, buying, and selling rates are quoted for 17 foreign currencies on the foreign exchange market of Frankfurt am Ma in .2 On December 31, 1984 the official middle rate for the U.S. dollar was DM 3.1480 per US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Germany formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from February 15, 1961. Administration of Control The administration of control in respect of imports and exports of goods and services is operated by the Federal Ministry of Economics, the Federal Ministry of Finance, the Federal Ministry of Transportation, the Federal Office for Trade and Industry, the Federal Ministry for Food, Agriculture, and Forestry, the Federal Office for Food and Forestry, the Federal Office for Agricultural Marketing Organization, and the Ministries of Econom- ics of the Laender. No such controls are currently in place. All banks in Germany are permitted to carry out foreign exchange transactions. A voluntary coordinating body within the banking system, the Central Capital Market Committee, formulates recommendations with regard to the timing of domestic bond issues, except issues by those institutions that have recourse to the capital market on a permanent basis. "Issue calendars" for foreign bonds denominated in deutsche mark are established on a voluntary basis by the Central Capital Market Subcommittee. Imports and Import Payments The Import List comprises a total of 9,170 statistical positions. Their treatment is as follows: some 8,484 items may be imported free of license from any country. Commodities corresponding to some 8,772 positions may be imported free of license from countries in Country List A /B .3 Most items under import licensing are agricultural commodities under EC regulations. The import of some 600 textile items is governed by bilateral agreements of the EC with various supplier countries under the arrangement regarding international trade in textiles. Imports of coal from countries that are not members of the European Coal and Steel Community are permitted within the framework of an annual global quota. The Common Agricultural Policy of the EC covers about 1,700 statistical items; most of these are subject to variable import levies which in most cases have replaced previous barriers to imports. De facto liberalization under what is called the AMLA (Ausschreibungen mit laufender Antragstellung) proce- dure is accorded to certain commodities (153 statistical items) when originating in countries in List C .4 Under the procedure, import licenses are issued automatically upon application, provided that domestic production and prices are not affected adversely. Imports of certain commodities among those not subject to licensing require, for surveillance purposes 'The term "Germany" is used in this survey as an abbreviation for the Federal Republic of Germany, including Berlin (West). 2Austrian schillings, Belgian and Luxembourg francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Irish pounds, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U .S. dollars. 3 Countries in List A/B are those of the former OEEC area and Finland and all other countries except those in List C.

Not for Redistribution only, an import declaration stamped by the Federal Office for Trade and Industry. These import declarations are partly prescribed by the EC. For imports still subject to quantitative restriction (with certain exceptions, such as food items imported by tourists, samples, gifts, and small parcels), an individual import license is required. Applications are normally invited by tender (Aus- schreibung) published in the Federal Official Gazette. Import licenses may be allocated to importers either on a first-come, first-served basis or on the basis of the total value of applications in relation to the quotas established for specified commodities. Payments for imports are unrestricted, even if the underlying import transaction is still restricted. Com- modity futures may be dealt in freely. Most transit trade transactions may also be carried out freely. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles may be made freely without individual license. German and foreign notes and coin and other means of payment may be exported freely. The following transactions—but not the related pay- ments—between residents and nonresidents are subject to restriction: the chartering of foreign ships from residents of specified countries and the conclusion of related sea freight contracts; the use of foreign boats in certain inland waterway traffic; transactions with specified countries (which do not grant reciprocal treat- ment) for hull and marine liability insurance and aviation insurance, except passenger accident insurance. Exports and Export Proceeds With few exceptions, export transactions may be carried out freely. For statistical purposes, an export notification is required for all goods. Certain exports (mostly strategic goods) are subject to individual licens- ing. The customs authorities exercise control over export declarations. Foreign exchange proceeds from exports do not have to be declared or surrendered, and they may be used for all payments. Proceeds from Invisibles With few exceptions, services performed for nonresi- dents do not require licenses. However, licenses are required for transactions related to specific sea services and for technical assistance through the delivery of constructional drawings, materials, and instructions for manufacture to residents of List C countries (see footnote 3), if such assistance is for the production of goods whose export requires a license. There are no restrictions on the receipt of payments for services rendered to nonresidents; however, receipts exceeding DM 2,000 on account of services have to be reported. German and foreign notes and coin and other means of payment may be imported freely. FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY Capital Residents and nonresidents may, in principle, export capital freely without a license. Foreign and international bond issues on the German capital market do not require official approval, although a voluntary monitoring sys- tem of issuing banks is operated by the Central Capital Market Subcommittee. The issue of bonds denominated in deutsche mark by subsidiaries of German banks in Luxembourg is banned, on the basis of a gentlemen's agreement between the banks and the Bundesbank. The issue of external bonds denominated in deutsche mark must be made through a banking consortium with at least one German bank with residence in Germany serving as a lead manager. In principle, domestic and foreign securities of all types may be imported or exported freely. Following the changes in regulations beginning March 12, 1981, no restrictions are applied on the sale of German money market papers and fixed interest securi- ties by residents to nonresidents. Nonresidents' direct investments in Germany, purchases of real estate in Germany for investment or personal use, and purchases of German or foreign equities do not require approval. There are no limitations on the disposal of legacies located in Germany and inherited by nonresidents or on legacies located abroad and inherited by residents. Residents are not required to repatriate or surrender their foreign exchange earnings or holdings. Banks are subject to minimum reserve requirements on the level of their foreign liabilities with maturities of less than four years; the rates of deposit at the end of 1983 were, in principle, the same as those applicable to domestic liabilities, that is, 10.15 percent, 7.15 percent, and 4.5 percent on demand, time, and savings deposits, respectively. The principal exemption is for banks' foreign currency borrowings that are immediately rein- vested abroad. Banks are free to pay interest on domestic or foreign currency balances held by nonresidents. Gold Residents may freely hold gold in any form at home or abroad and may negotiate gold in any form with residents or nonresidents, at home or abroad. There is a free gold market in Frankfurt. Imports and exports of gold in any form by residents and nonresidents are unrestricted and free of license; a customs declaration, however, is required. Imports of gold bullion and coin, unworked gold, and gold alloys are free of customs duty but are subject to value-added tax at a rate of 14 percent. In the case of imports of gold coin where the assessment basis exceeds 250 percent of the fine gold value, the value-added tax is levied at a rate of 7 percent. Imports of monetary gold by the Bundesbank are exempt from value-added tax and from customs du ty. Domestic transactions in gold are to value-added tax at the same rate as imports, 219 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY but under certain conditions no value-added tax is levied on transactions in gold bullion effected on gold ex- changes between brokers who are admitted to these exchanges. Commercial imports and exports of articles containing gold are subject to the general foreign trade regulations and in all cases are liberalized. Changes During 1984 Capital August 1. The withholding tax of 25 percent ("coupon tax") levied on interest payments to nonresident holders of German fixed interest securities was abolished. 220 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution™ GHANA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Ghana is the Ghanaian Cedi. In June 1978, Ghana introduced a flexible exchange system under which the exchange rate for the cedi in terms of the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, was to be adjusted to reflect the underlying economic, financial, and balance of payments situation. Such adjustments were discontinued, however, in August 1978. On April 21, 1983, a multiple exchange rate system was introduced, based on bonuses and surcharges applied to specified transactions by the banks and other authorized dealers of foreign exchange at the rates of 750 percent and 990 percent of the official exchange rate of (£ 2.75 = US$1, and yielding exchange rates of <£ 23.375 = US$1 and # 29.975 = US$1. On October 10, 1983, the multiple exchange rate system was abolished, and the exchange rate system was unified at the rate of ^ 30 = US$1. During 1984, the cedi was adjusted three times, from $, 30 to <£ 50 = US$1, for a cumulative depreciation of 40 percent; on December 31, 1984, the exchange rate was (£ 50 = US$1. Rates are also quoted for certain other currencies,l with daily quotations based on the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar in markets abroad. Rates for certain inconvertible curren- cies of the West African region, including the Nigerian naira, are also quoted daily, but are only applied to transactions under the West African Clearing House arrangement. The other quoted inconvertible currencies are the Gambian dalasi, the Guinean syli, the Sierra Leonean leone, the Guinea-Bissau peso, and the Mauritanian ouguiya. The authorized banks may ex- change Ghanaian currency for any foreign currency. A processing fee of 5 percent is levied on purchases and repurchases of foreign exchange related to travel, and on exchange purchases for education, medical treatment abroad, and for private outward transfers. Administration of Control The Controller of Imports and Exports at the Ministry of Trade is empowered to prohibit, regulate, or license all imports and exports. Applications by the industrial sector and certain state agencies for individual import licenses must be channeled through the appropriate ministry or government agency for endorsement. The Controller of Imports and Exports issues import licenses on the basis of an annual import program formulated by the Ministries of Finance and Trade. The allocation of foreign exchange among sectors is made by the Foreign Exchange Allocation and Monitoring Committee (FEAMC), comprising the Secretaries of Finance, Indus- 1 Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, CFA francs, Danish kroner, French francs, deutsche mark, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, New Zealand dollars, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. tries, Agriculture, Trade, and Health, with the Coor- dinating Secretary as Chairman. All import licenses must be signed by the Director of Imports. The Exchange Control Department of the Bank of Ghana administers the allocation of exchange for payments for invisibles and capital. Permitted foreign exchange transactions must be made through authorized banks. Prescription of Currency Settlements between residents of Ghana and residents of other countries are made in permitted currencies. However, settlements related to transactions covered by bilateral payments agreements are made through clearing accounts maintained by the Bank of Ghana and the central or state banks of the countries concerned.2 Furthermore, proceeds from exports to countries with which Ghana does not have payments agreements must be received in the currency of the importing country (if that currency is among the currencies quoted by the Bank of Ghana) or in deutsche mark, pounds sterling, or U.S. dollars. Current payments to or from the Central Bank of West African States (for Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Niger, Senegal, and Togo) and The Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are normally made through the West African Clearing House. Nonresident Accounts Nonresident account status is granted to embassies, legations, consulates, and offices of high commissioners in Ghana and to the career and established members of their staffs. This facility is also available to international institutions and foreign-registered companies operating in Ghana, as well as to nonresident Ghanaians. The opening of these accounts is subject to approval by the Bank of Ghana. The accounts may be credited with authorized outward payments, with transfers from other Foreign Accounts, and with the proceeds from sales of any convertible currency, other than restricted curren- cies. They may be debited for inward payments, for transfers to other Foreign Accounts, and for purchases of external currencies. Nonresident accounts maintained under the provisions of bilateral payments agreements are called "Official Accounts" or "Territorial Accounts." These accounts may be credited with authorized outward payments by residents, with transfers from Foreign Accounts, with payments received through the Bank of Ghana for settlements with bilateral payments agreement countries, and with proceeds from sales of external currencies, other than restricted currencies. They may be debited for 2Ghana maintains operative bilateral payments arrangements with Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, the German Democratic Republic, Romania, and Yugoslavia. 221 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GHANA authorized inward payments to residents of Ghana, for transfers to other Official Accounts related to the same country, and for transfers to the related clearing account at the Bank of Ghana. Funds not placed at the free disposal of nonresidents, for example, certain types of capital proceeds, may be deposited in Blocked Accounts. These accounts may be debited for authorized payments, including the purchase of approved securities. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Namibia (South West Africa) and South Africa are not permitted. Imports of some goods, including virtually all textiles and textile products, chocolate, and chilled or frozen fish, are prohibited. Imports of certain goods also produced in Ghana, certain luxury commodities, and certain goods deemed harmful to health or public order are severely restricted. Importa- tion of certain goods may be allowed under special license where no transfer of foreign exchange through the Bank of Ghana or a commercial bank is required. There is an open general license which permits any importer to import freely from any country trade sam- ples, personal or household effects, small gifts, single copies of publications, domestic pets, headloads of foodstuffs from neighboring countries, fish caught by Ghanaian-owned vessels, and reimports. All other items involving use of official foreign exchange require a specific import license. There is a list of commercial imports eligible for specific licenses which are issued for items that are considered essential within the framework of an annual import program. Certain imports are channeled through a bulk purchasing agent, the Ghana National Procurement Agency, or for public sector imports, the Ghana Supply Commission. For cases not requiring the provision of official foreign exchange, there is a special license by which specific goods can be imported in commercial quantities. Except for aid imports, import licenses do not specify the country from which the commodity has to be imported, but they do specify whether payment is to be made in convertible or inconvertible currency. Licenses for payment in inconvertible currencies may be used for imports from any payments agreement country. Licenses are issued on a c. & f. basis and are endorsed to the effect that insurance must be covered in Ghana. Exchange for payment of approved imports is, in principle, granted freely by the Bank of Ghana. How- ever, arrears exist with respect to both current import payments and the repayments of matured 180-day trade credits established before February 7, 1972. With effect from January 2, 1980 the Bank of Ghana ceased to issue letters of credit or to perform other commercial banking operations related to import transactions. The Bank of Ghana, however, provides the necessary foreign ex- change cover to the authorized banks. Most imports are effected with confirmed letters of credit established through Ghanaian banks, and usually on a sight basis. For imports valued at over US$2,000 f .o .b ., banks are 222 forbidden to make payments against a letter of credit or a bank draft unless the import documents include a clean report of findings issued by the Societe Generate de Surveillance (SGS), which inspects the goods and verifies the price, quality, and quantity in the country of origin or shipment. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require specific approval of the Exchange Control Department of the Bank of Ghana, and documentary evidence must support all applications. Certain payments and transfers are in arrears. Most foreign exchange purchases for invisible payments are subject to a processing fee of 5 percent ad valorem, with the exception of invisible payments relating to imports. Transfers of normal bank charges payable to overseas bankers for import payments are generally authorized. The payment of buying commissions on imports is not permitted. Freight charges may be paid to the local shipping agents; the transfer of funds to cover such charges is normally permitted, provided that the applica- tion is properly documented. With few exceptions, insurance on all imports shipped to Ghana on f .o .b. or c. & f. terms must be arranged in Ghanaian currency with local insurance companies. Remittances of income by non-Ghanaian employees and self-employed persons are normally limited to 40 percent of their net annual earnings, up to a maximum of US$2,600 a year plus leave pay; this personal remittance quota is intended to cover all personal and family requirements and commitments outside Ghana, including leave expenses, travel, education, insurance premiums, and subscriptions. Employees in the mining, timber, fishing, petroleum, and banking industries are, however, offered a choice between two alternative facilities. Under one of these, they are allowed to transfer 40 percent of their net annual earnings, up to a maximum of US$2,600 a year, plus leave pay and the balance on their savings at the end of their tour of duty. Under the other facility, when documentary evidence of their commitments outside Ghana can be produced in support of their applications, employees can transfer up to 70 percent of their net annual earnings and the balance on their savings at the end of their tour of duty. With the exception of companies financed with locally raised capital, nonresident companies are, in principle, per- mitted to transfer abroad freely their net profits after tax; at present, however, transfers of profits are being authorized only on a limited basis. The transfer of profits by companies that have been financed with locally raised capital is not permitted. The basic exchange allocation for tourist travel, which had been reintroduced on August 21, 1978, was sus- pended again on August 7, 1979. Foreign exchange is not provided for tourist travel, and foreign exchange for business travel is granted only in exceptional cases, with per diem allowances determined on a case-by-case basis. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Resident travelers may take with them foreign cur- rency notes equivalent to 0 160, provided that not more than the equivalent of (£ 40 is taken in any one currency. Ghanaian bank notes up to (£ 40 may be taken out by any traveler. Nonresident travelers may take out any un- utilized foreign currency brought in and declared upon entry. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Namibia (South West Africa) and South Africa are prohibited. Exports of iron and steel scrap also are prohibited. Cocoa and certain other agricultural products are exported through a state-owned export agency, the Cocoa Marketing Company, and diamonds are exported through the Diamond Marketing Corpora- tion. Normally, specific export licenses are required. Exports of bauxite, gold, manganese, and timber are subject to a 6 percent export tax; for cocoa, the export tax is 100 percent on export proceeds above a specified level. With the exceptions noted below, exporters are re- quired to collect and repatriate the full proceeds from their exports within 60 days of shipment; export pro- ceeds in foreign exchange must be surrendered to a commercial bank in Ghana upon receipt. A number of companies in the export sector are allowed to retain up to 20 percent of their export proceeds in accounts abroad for financing essential imports. (Such imports are, however, subject to the import license.) The foreign exchange retention scheme applies to all exports except residual oil and electricity; in the case of the cocoa sector, the retention limit is 10 percent. Proceeds from Invisibles All receipts from invisibles must be sold to authorized dealers. Foreign currency notes may be imported freely. Repurchases of foreign exchange acquired for the pur- pose of foreign travel are subject to a processing fee of 5 percent. The import of Ghanaian currency notes in excess of (£ 40 is prohibited. Capital Foreign investments in Ghana require prior approval by the Capital Investment Centre if they are to benefit • f rom the facilities available under the Investments Code, 1981. Investments approved under the Code are guaran- teed, in principle, the right to transfer profits and, in the event of sale or liquidation, capital proceeds; tax holidays, initial capital allowances, etc., are also avail- able for such investments. The Code stipulates that the assets of foreign investors may not be expropriated and that, when approved enterprises are nationalized, fair compensation is to be determined. Where there is a dispute over the amount of compensation, the dispute shall be settled in accordance with the established procedure for conciliation, for example, through arbitra- tion by the International Center for Settlements of Investment Disputes. Certain areas of economic activity are not open to foreigners. The proceeds of the sales of GHANA foreign ownership to Ghanaian nationals are held in blocked, noninterest-bearing accounts w i th the Bank of Ghana; these accounts carry an exchange rate guarantee. Transfers of such funds are being effected gradually. All outgoing capital movements must be approved by the Bank of Ghana; applications for such transfers must be supported by documentary evidence and are consid- ered on their merits. Transfers to beneficiaries under wills and intestacies are approved, provided that all local indebtedness has been settled. Requests for the transfer of funds representing personal assets of foreign residents in Ghana who emigrate are considered individually on their merits. Applications must be supported by appro- priate documentation showing that the savings are genuine and that no illegal transfer of capital is involved. Proceeds from the liquidation of the real assets of foreign nationals leaving Ghana may be approved for transfer in one lump sum or may be spread over a period of time, depending on the amount. Loan and overdraft facilities to resident companies controlled by nonresidents require the individual ap- proval of the Bank of Ghana. Residents who are private persons are not normally granted foreign exchange for the acquisition of securities or personal real estate abroad. Transactions in securities are controlled to ensure that capital is not transferred abroad. In respect of portfolio investments, residents must obtain approval for any switch in their holdings of securities issued by nonresidents. Private sector and commercial bank bor- rowing require the approval of the Bank of Ghana, as do private import credits for machinery and equipment valued at US$100,000 or more; foreign borrowing by Ghanaian nationals is subject to certain guidelines by the Government. Lending to nonresidents is prohibited, except for export credits; these require exchange control approval, and normally are limited to 60 days. Under a system of external accounts for debt service payments introduced in 1980 to enable export-oriented industries to get external aid, such industries are allowed to operate foreign exchange accounts (in addition to their regular retention accounts) with funds earmarked from export earnings, for the purpose of debt service pay- ments. The opening of such accounts requires the approval of the Committee on Suppliers' Credit and the Exchange Control Department of the Bank of Ghana; the latter also monitors the receipts and payments out of these accounts. Such accounts have been established for the diamond sector as well as for the fishing and timber companies financed with suppliers' credits. Gold Residents may hold and negotiate in Ghana gold obtained domestically by washing or mining according to indigenous methods, gold coins that are collectors' pieces, and gold jewelry. Other domestic transactions in gold, as well as imports and exports, may be authorized by the Ministry of Trade in collaboration w i th the Bank of Ghana, and certain domestic sales may be carried out by permit under the Gold Mining Products Protection 223 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GHANA Ordinance. With these exceptions, Ghanaian residents may not buy or borrow any gold from, or sell or lend any gold to, any person other than an authorized dealer. Imports of gold other than imports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities are not normally licensed. The import duty on bullion, partly worked gold, and other gold is levied at a uniform rate of 30 percent. The gold mines export their output in semirefmed form. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement March 26. The exchange rate for the cedi in terms of the U.S. dollar was changed from # 30.0 = US$1 to $ 35 = US$1, representing a depreciation of 14.3 percent. August 23. The exchange rate of the cedi was changed to <£ 38.50 = US$1, a depreciation of 9.1 percent. November 30. The cedi was depreciated further to <£ 50.0 = US$1, or by 23 percent. Prescription of Currency September 24. Ghana concluded a new bilateral pay- ments arrangement with the People's Republic of China. Payments of Invisibles May 1. Following the abolition of the foreign ex- change tax and the foreign travel tax, most foreign exchange purchases for invisible payments became subject to a processing fee of 5 percent ad valorem, with the exception of invisible payments relating to imports. The fee was made applicable to airline tickets, purchases and repurchases of foreign exchange for travel, trans- fers for medical expenses, private transfers for educa- tional purposes, and other private transfers, dues, and subscriptions. 224 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GREECE (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Greece is the Greek Drachma. Although a member of the EC, Greece does not participate in the exchange rate and intervention mecha- nism of the European Monetary System (EMS). The authorities of Greece operate a managed float for the drachma. On December 31, 1984 buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, in the interbank market were Dr 128.095 and Dr 128.865, respectively, per US$1. Official exchange rates for the U.S. dollar and other currencies1 are determined during the daily fixing session in which the Bank of Greece and the authorized commercial banks participate. A compul- sory commission is charged on all foreign exchange transactions. The commission rate declines from 0.2 per- cent to 0.0125 percent as the size of the transaction increases from Dr 250,000 to Dr 30 million; no charges are levied on transactions of up to US$150, and the maximum charge of Dr 4,500 is applied only to purchases of foreign exchange. The Bank of Greece offers forward cover in U .S. dollars only, at rates determined by the Bank. Administration of Control Exchange control policy is the responsibility of the Bank of Greece (the central bank). Under Law No. 9367 79, the Ministry of Commerce is responsible for import and export policy. Exchange control is implemented and foreign exchange approvals for imports in specified cases are granted by authorized commercial banks. Import and export licenses are also issued by authorized banks. The authorized banks may make exchange set- tlements relating to most trade transactions and may grant residents a standard travel allowance. They may also make exchange payments for a number of specified transactions in invisibles. Prescription of Currency Settlements with all countries are made in any con- vertible currency or through External Sight Deposit Accounts in convertible drachmas. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents may maintain accounts in Greece, as follows: 1. Deposits in foreign exchange under Legislative Decree No. 2687/53. Nonresidents may establish Time Deposit Accounts in foreign currency for a minimum period of six months and w i th a m in imum deposit in convertible currencies equivalent to US$10,000; bal- 1 Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Cyprus pounds, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Irish pounds, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwe- gian kroner, pounds sterling, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. ances on these accounts earn interest not exceeding 8 percent a year. Interest rates vary according to the term of the account, but limits are fixed, as follows: for 6 months to 12 months, 7 percent a year; for 12 months to 24 months, 7.5 percent a year; and for 24 months and over, 8 percent a year. Principal and interest are freely transferable at maturity in the currency of the deposit. 2. External Sight Deposit Accounts in convertible drachmas and in foreign currencies. Nonresidents are permitted to open External Sight Deposit Accounts in convertible drachmas or foreign currencies. Deposit accounts in convertible drachmas are credited with the drachma proceeds of foreign currencies surrendered by a bank to the Bank of Greece against drachmas at the official rate of exchange. Deposits in convertible foreign currency are held by the banks. Any withdrawal from drachma accounts for use in Greece and any conversion of withdrawals from foreign currency accounts into drachmas entail the loss of the reconversion right for the sums withdrawn. At the end of 1984, the maximum rate of interest on such accounts with the banks was 1.5 per- cent a year. In the case of accounts held by the international organizations in which Greece participates, interest rates are freely determined by the banks. These accounts may be credited with (a) convertible foreign exchange or the proceeds from sales of convertible currencies; (b) authorized payments by residents of Greece for imports or services payable in convertible currencies; (c) transfers from other External Sight De- posit Accounts; and (d) accrued interest on these de- posits. They may be debited for (a) payments to residents for current transactions, exports, and services; (b) the purchase and transfer abroad of any convertible cur- rency; and (c) transfers to other External Sight Deposit Accounts. 3. Time Deposit Accounts in convertible foreign exchange. Nonresidents may make time deposits in convertible foreign exchange with banks authorized to deal in foreign exchange. The interest rate is determined freely by the banks according to prevailing rates in the international money markets. 4. Time Deposit Accounts in convertible drachmas. Nonresidents may open Time Deposit Accounts denomi- nated in convertible drachmas for durations of 1, 3, or 6 months. The interest rate on such deposits may be freely negotiated. Banks are authorized to make loans in convertible drachmas to credit institutions abroad for periods not exceeding 6 months, in amounts not exceed- ing the bank's total deposits in convertible drachmas. 5. Deposits in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, and pounds sterling. Greek citizens (including seamen) working abroad, certain Greek societies and associations operating abroad, and Greek nationals residing abroad may make, with funds originating abroad, deposits in U .S. dollars, Canadian dollars, and pounds sterling with 225 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GREECE authorized banks in Greece. The interest rates are freely determined by the banks, taking into account interest rates applied by the Bank of Greece on the corresponding redeposits; at the end of 1984, the interest rates offered by the Bank of Greece ranged (depending on deposit maturity) from (a) 83/s percent to 97/s percent for U.S. dollar accounts; (b) 10 percent to 107/ie percent for accounts in Canadian dollars; and (c) 91/2 percent to 103/i6 percent for accounts in pounds sterling. Should the depositor decide at the time of deposit to withdraw accrued interest in drachmas, the interest rate is in- creased by 1.5 percentage points annually. The banks are obliged to redeposit with the Bank of Greece at least 70 percent of the increase in such deposits after July 1, 1980, at interest rates set by the Bank of Greece in accordance with developments in the Eurodollar market. The remaining 30 percent can be deposited abroad, with other domestic banks, the Bank of Greece, or placed in other assets. 6. Deposits in other convertible currencies (excluding U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, and pounds sterling). Greek citizens (including seamen) working abroad and certain Greek societies and associations operating abroad may open, with funds originating abroad, convertible foreign currency accounts in deutsche mark and other currencies (excluding U .S. dollars, Canadian dollars, and pounds sterling) with authorized banks in Greece. The period and the other terms of the deposits are freely determined by the banks. The Bank of Greece estab- lishes maximum interest rates for each type and currency of deposit based on developments in the internal money markets of the countries in whose currencies the deposits are denominated. Should the depositor decide at the time of deposit to withdraw accrued interest in drachmas, the interest rate is increased by 1.5 percentage points annually. At the end of 1984 the maximum annual interest rates2 payable on these accounts for some of the currencies ranged from (a) 5.5 percent to 7.5 percent for accounts in deutsche mark, (b) 8.5 percent to 12.5 per- cent for accounts in French francs, (c) 3 percent to 5.25 percent for accounts in Swiss francs, and (d) from 9.5 percent to 12 percent for accounts in Belgian francs. Withdrawals in drachmas entail the loss of the reconver- sion right for the sums withdrawn. The banks are obliged to surrender the entire foreign exchange proceeds to the Bank of Greece at fixed parities in exchange for drachmas. Balances on these accounts, including accrued interest, are freely convert- ible into foreign exchange against reconversion of drachmas at the same fixed parities that were applied at the time of original conversion. Similar facilities for foreign currency accounts exist under a Housing Loan Deposit Scheme. The banks are not obliged to redeposit or in any way surrender to the Bank of Greece foreign exchange from the following deposit categories: (i) deposits of shipping 2 These are defined as the interest rates for a deposit of the equivalent of US$200,000 in convertible currencies. 226 (including shipowners), insurance and construction com- panies and of Olympic Airways; and (ii) deposits above the equivalent of US$200,000 for each depositor within the categories mentioned in 5 and 6 above and in all convertible currencies. 7. Blocked Accounts. All drachma assets of nonresi- dents other than those in External Sight Deposit Ac- counts must be declared, and are held in Blocked Accounts. Domestic bank notes in excess of Dr 3,000 brought in by nonresident travelers must also be credited to a Blocked Account, as must certain income accruing in Greece to nonresidents. Subject to the approval of the exchange control authorities, balances on Blocked Ac- counts held by residents of all countries excluding Turkey and Israel may be used for such purposes as (a) travel expenses for each visit to Greece and personal expenses in Greece up to Dr 200,000 a month of the visitor's stay in Greece and up to Dr 100,000 for other members of his family; for residents of Turkey or Israel, the corresponding limit is Dr 25,000 annually; (b) ex- penses for buying tickets for a maximum of two trips to Greece by the depositor and other members of his family; (c) expenses for paying taxes and lawyers' fees; and (d) investing in securities officially listed on the stock exchange in Greece and purchasing real estate in Greece. Payments abroad from funds in Blocked Ac- counts held by residents of countries that have special agreements with Greece3 may be released for remittance (a) if the money deposited is derived exclusively from rents, amounts of up to US$1,000 (or its equivalent) may be transferred abroad semiannually or (b) if the money deposited is derived exclusively from pensions and the holder has been resident abroad since before Decem- ber 31, 1975, up to US$300 a month, plus bonuses for New Year, Easter, and vacation, up to a total of US$4,200 annually, may be remitted abroad. Funds derived from dividends of postwar public loans and loans of public organizations are freely transferable abroad, and other balances on Blocked Accounts may be trans- ferred abroad if the prior approval of the Bank of Greece is obtained. All transfers between Blocked Accounts require prior approval. The amounts that may be with- drawn from Blocked Accounts differ in cases where the holders do not live in the countries listed in footnote 3. Balances on Blocked Accounts held by private individu- als in the EC member countries are scheduled to be released in six equal annual installments during the period January 1, 1981 to January 1, 1986. Blocked balances may be deposited either with the Bank of Greece, where they bear no interest, or with a commercial bank, the Consignations and Loans Fund, and the Postal Savings Bank, where they may earn up to the same rate of interest as savings deposits at commer- cial banks (15 percent at end of 1984). 3 Australia, Austria, Be lg ium, Canada, Denmark, France, Federal Republic of Germany, Iceland, Ireland, I ta ly, Luxembourg, Nether- lands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United King- dom, and Un i ted States. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Resident Accounts Greek citizens have the option to open accounts in foreign exchange of the types described in paragraphs 5 and 6 above with foreign exchange earned as salaries from work abroad or as payments received for services performed outside Greece. Up to September 30, 1983, time deposit accounts in foreign currencies could be opened with authorized banks in Greece by residents of Greece and by nonprofit legal entities in private law having head offices in Greece, without stating the origin of the funds. Such accounts can be for a term of either 6 or 12 months, with the possibility of renewal. Interest rates are determined by the Bank of Greece on the basis of the rates prevailing in the international money markets. At the end of 1984, the maximum interest rates4 ranged (depending on size and maturity of deposit) from (a) 7 percent to 9.5 per- cent for accounts in U .S. dollars, (b) 7.5 percent to 10.25 percent for accounts in Canadian dollars, (c) 7.25 percent to 9.5 percent for accounts in pounds sterling, and (d) 5.5 percent to 6.25 percent for accounts in deutsche mark and other specified currencies. Should the depositor decide at the time of deposit to withdraw accrued interest in drachmas, the interest rate would be increased by 1.5 percentage points annually. The banks are obliged to redeposit the entire foreign exchange with the Bank of Greece. Imports and Import Payments5 Approval for imports is generally not required. Import licenses are required only for imports of commodities in Lists A and B (including textiles, television receivers, and certain foodstuffs, passenger cars, buses, and certain types of machinery and spare parts). For a few items on Lists A and B licenses are being issued restrictively, but for the remainder they are issued automatically. Special regulations govern imports of certain items, such as goods under monopoly control, medicines, narcotics, su lfur, and motion-picture films. Import licenses are not required for a few items in Lists A and B (such as textiles, cars, toys, certain types of machinery, car tire tubes, paper, ceramics, and cheese) if they are imported from EC countries. Goods must be shipped within six months and arrive in Greece within three months of shipment. Final settlement of the value of imported goods must take place within 60 days following the date of arrival at the first Greek port. Most imports are subject to a stamp tax of 2.4— 6.0 percent of the c . i . f. duty-paid and tax-paid value. Special regulations govern imports by state agencies, public entities, and public utility companies. 4 These are defined as the interest rates for a deposit in convertible currencies equivalent to US$50,000. 5The import restrictions which Greece imposed on February 18, 1983 on five industrial items, covering less than 2 percent of Greece's total annual imports, were extended twice: first through October 31, 1984, and then through December 31, 1985. GREECE Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles require approval, which is granted freely for expenses incidental to authorized transactions. Residents traveling abroad for family reasons or tourism are entitled once a year to the equivalent of ECU 640 for travel6 to EC member countries and US$250 for travel to all other countries. In addition, persons traveling to Cyprus are entitled to an annual foreign exchange allowance of US$450. In lieu of this allowance, tourists participating in group tours are granted an amount based on a cost declaration submitted by the travel agency. Commercial banks operating in Greece are authorized to grant foreign exchange for various categories of travelers (e.g., industrialists, hote- liers, exporters, travel agents, journalists) subject to a certain maximum per diem or per trip limit set by the Bank of Greece. The limits range from US$75-120 a day to US$600-!,200 a trip, depending on the professional category. For allocations beyond these limits, interested parties must submit documentation to the International Transactions Department of the Bank of Greece for approval. For medical treatment abroad, a subcommittee authorizes any amount for transfer direct to a foreign hospital, provided that the relevant bills are submitted. For undergraduate and postgraduate studies, various allocations are authorized, depending on the country of study, such as US$600 and US$660 a month, respec- tively, for the United States and Canada; £ stg. 290 and £ stg. 350 a month, respectively, for the United Kingdom; and DM 910 and DM 1,070 a month, respectively, for the Federal Republic of Germany. Authorized banks are also empowered to grant foreign exchange up to US$470 to cover the initial expenses of Greek nationals pursuing postgraduate studies abroad. Travelers may take with them a maximum of Dr 3,000 in Greek bank notes. Greek nationals, not including those resident abroad, are required to declare all domes- tic and foreign bank notes and other valuables taken with them upon leaving Greece. On leaving Greece, nonresi- dent travelers may freely take with them up to US$500 in foreign bank notes without having declared them upon entry; the export of larger amounts after a visit of less than 12 months is also not subject to approval, provided that there was a declaration upon entry. Approval is required for larger sums that have been declared if the visit exceeds 12 months. Payments of interest, profits, and dividends to coun- tries other than EC members are restricted, and special regulations and limits apply to outward remittances of interest, dividends, and profits (see section on Capital, below). 6 On January 1, 1985, the foreign exchange allowance for ind iv idual travel to other EC countries for fam i ly reasons or tourism was increased to the equivalent of ECU 720. 227 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GREECE Exports and Export Proceeds Almost all exports require individual licenses and are free of quantitative limitation. Export proceeds must be surrendered within 90 days from the date of export of the goods; in special cases, however, the authorities are empowered to extend this period up to two years for manufactures and up to one year for other commodities. Industrial exporters can obtain subsidies in the form of interest rebates on loans or income tax deductions. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts representing payments for services must be surrendered. Exchange proceeds from shipping are exempt from the surrender requirement, but ship- owners must cover their disbursements and expenses in Greece in local currency obtained through the sale of foreign exchange to the Bank of Greece. Travelers may bring in a maximum of Dr 3,000 in Greek bank notes. Any surplus is deposited in a Blocked Account with the Bank of Greece; subject to prior approval by the Bank, the surplus may be taken out on departure or spent in Greece on personal requirements. Greek residents returning to Greece must declare the foreign exchange in their possession if they wish to take it out for the next journey. Nonresident travelers of foreign nationality may import any amount of foreign currency and need not declare it. Nonresidents, includ- ing those who hold Greek passports, are required to declare their foreign exchange only if they intend, when leaving Greece, to take out again foreign exchange in excess of US$500 or its equivalent. Capital Commercial banks and investment banks may borrow convertible currencies abroad, provided that they extend medium-term and long-term loans of equal amounts in foreign currency (or drachma loans with a foreign exchange clause) to productive enterprises established in Greece. All other investments in Greece by nonresidents are subject to approval (mainly for securing repatriation of imported capital). Such approval is automatic for purchases of real estate for personal use, but repatriation of the proceeds of liquidation is subject to the approval of the Bank of Greece. Under Legislative Decree No. 2687/53, approved foreign investments which aim at the promotion of national production or otherwise contribute to the economic advancement of Greece may be granted preferential treatment; this decree also provides for the opening of foreign currency accounts by nonresidents and the retransfer of the deposits, as well as the transfer of interest thereon. In accordance w i th Article 5 of the Legislative Decree No. 2687/53, (1) approved investments may not be repatriated before one year from the date the enterprise begins to operate productively and in no case before one year from the date the capital was imported. (2) The repatriation of foreign capital may not exceed 10 percent a year of the amount of capital imported. The repatria- 228 tion of dividends on equity capital and of interest on loan capital may not exceed 12 percent a year and 10 percent a year, respectively. But under Legislative Decree No. 4256/62, as amended by Law No. 849/78, enter- prises engaged in exports are granted higher rates in respect of capital and profit remittances, provided that the total amount required for this purpose does not exceed 30 percent of the foreign exchange earnings of the enterprise from exports during the same year. In the case of loan capital, this provision is applicable on the additional condition that such capital does not exceed twice the share capital of the enterprise and that the remittable amount does not exceed 20 percent annually of loan capital. (3) Both originally and subsequently imported funds for investment capital are considered as imported foreign capital. The total amount or a part of profits realized from foreign capital may also be consid- ered as foreign capital, provided such profits are rein- vested in the enterprise. (4) In cases of leasing of machinery, or other form of foreign capital, the amount of rental is transferable in foreign exchange. If part of the foreign capital imported has been repatriated, the trans- fer of profits is related to the part of the capital remaining in Greece and the transfer privilege expires as soon as all capital has been repatriated. However, for enterprises under Law No. 4171/61 (productive investment exceed- ing Dr 150 million or expansion exceeding Dr 50 mil- lion), a percentage of the profits not exceeding 6 percent annually on the repatriated part of the capital is allowed to be remitted abroad, provided that this percentage is not more than 8 percent of the foreign exchange earnings of the enterprise from the sale of its product abroad. Deviations from the general regulations may be approved for foreign capital imported to develop exports of agricultural and mining products or invested in enterprises of special importance to the economy. Specified foreign short-term investment may also be granted preferential treatment in respect of the repatria- tion of capital and the transfer of interest. Transfers of capital abroad by residents require ap- proval . The purchase abroad of securities or of real estate for personal use is not normally permitted. Gold Residents may freely purchase new gold sovereigns (i.e., those issued since 1974) from the Bank of Greece, through licensed stockbrokers, at prices set by the Bank of Greece; these coins may be resold only to the Bank of Greece or to licensed stockbrokers. Holders of gold coin acquired in the free market that existed prior to Decem- ber 22, 1965 may sell these anonymously and without formality to the Bank of Greece or to an authorized bank at the official price. Imports of gold against payment in foreign exchange are on Import List F and require a special license; licenses are normally issued to reputable importers for distribution to recognized users, such as jewelers and dentists. Gold bars and gold coin may be imported freely, for purposes other than commercial, by ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution other residents, as well as by nonresidents when no payment in foreign exchange is involved. Exports of gold other than by the Bank of Greece are not approved, except that gold bars or coin brought in by travelers and declared upon entry may, with the prior approval of the Bank's Credit Subcommittee, be re-exported by the same person. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement January 1. All advance import deposit requirements were abolished. Nonresident Accounts September 14. Permission was granted for nonresi- dents to open time deposits in convertible drachmas. Such deposits were permitted to be within durations of 1, 3, or 6 months, with interest rates to be freely negotiated. In addition, banks were authorized to make convertible drachma loans to credit institutions abroad for periods of up to 6 months, in amounts not exceeding the bank's total deposits in convertible drachmas. GREECE October 1. The maximum rate of interest payable on blocked deposits with commercial banks, the Consigna- tions and Loans Fund, and the Postal Savings Bank was raised from 11.5 percent annually to the rate of interest paid on savings deposits at domestic commercial banks. Imports and Import Payments January I. All imports were exempted from bank approval requirements, and all restrictions on permissi- ble methods of import payments were lifted. In addition, a time limit of 60 days from arrival date at the first Greek port was imposed for import settlements. January 11. The Commission of the European Com- munities agreed that Greece could extend until Octo- ber 31, 1984, the quantitative restrictions on imports of the following items from EC countries: cigarettes and manufactured tobacco products, tiles, cast-iron sanitary ware, taps, cocks, valves and similar appliances, and furniture other than for medical use. November 29. The quantitative restrictions agreed by the EC Commission on January 11, 1984 were extended until December 31, 1985. 229 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GRENADA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Grenada is the Eastern Caribbean Dollar,1 which is issued by the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB). The Eastern Caribbean dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at EC$2.70 = US$1. The ECCB also quotes daily rates for the Canadian dollar and the pound sterling. A 5 percent exchange tax is levied on all sales of foreign exchange by commercial banks, except for payments for imports of some basic foods and drugs. Administration of Control Exchange control applies to all countries. It is ad- ministered by the Ministry of Planning, Finance, and Trade. The Ministry delegates to authorized dealers the authority to approve some import payments and certain other outward payments. The exchange control direc- tives do not apply to transactions with South Africa. Trade controls also are administered by the Ministry of Planning, Finance, and Trade. Prescription of Currency Settlements with residents of member countries of the Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM)2 must be made either through External Accounts (in Eastern Caribbean dollars) or in the currency of the CARICOM country concerned. Settlements with residents of the former Sterling Area countries, other than CARICOM countries, may be made in sterling, in any other former Sterling Area currency, or in Eastern Caribbean dollars to and from External Accounts. Settlements with residents of countries outside the former Sterling Area other than South Africa may be made in any foreign currency3 or through an External Account in Eastern Caribbean dollars. Nonresident Accounts External Accounts may be opened for nonresidents by authorized dealers without reference to the Ministry of Planning, Finance, and Trade. These accounts are maintained in Eastern Caribbean dollars. They may be credited with proceeds from the sale of foreign curren- cies, with transfers from other External Accounts, with bank interest (payable on External Accounts), and with payments by residents for which general or specific permission has been given by the Ministry.

Other debits and any overdrafts require individual approval. Foreign Currency Accounts Residents and nonresidents are permitted to open foreign currency accounts. Such accounts may be freely debited, but can be credited with only foreign exchange earned or received from outside the ECCB area. Imports and Import Payments4 All imports from South Africa are prohibited. Most goods may be freely imported under open general license from all other countries. Certain other commodities require individual licenses. Payments for documented imports are free of restric- tions. Payments for other authorized imports are per- mitted upon application and submission of documentary evidence (invoices and customs warrants) to the Ministry of Planning, Finance, and Trade. Advance payments for imports also require prior approval by this Ministry. Imports of equipment, spare parts, and raw materials for the manufacture of approved goods are exempted from import duties. Imports not exempt from customs du ty are subject to a stamp tax of 15 percent of the c . i . f. value, as well as to an international airport levy amounting to 5 percent of c . i . f. value. Payments for Invisibles With the exception of outward remittances for educa- tion, medical treatment, gifts, family maintenance, profits, dividends, insurance premiums, and proceeds from sales of local property, royalties, and management fees, payments for invisibles require exchange control approval. Authority has been delegated to authorized dealers to provide basic allocations of foreign exchange for a few types of payments. These include foreign travel (for which up to EC$5,000 a person a calendar year may be allocated for private travel and up to EC$10,000 a person for business travel), subscriptions to magazines and periodicals, and life insurance premiums on policies contracted before June 1975. With the exception of tourism, applications for additional amounts or for purposes for which there is no basic allocation normally are approved by the Ministry of Planning, Finance, and Trade, provided that no unauthorized transfer of capital is involved. Applications in respect of tourism in excess of EC$5,000 a person are considered on their merits.

Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to South Africa are prohibited, and specific licenses are required for the export of certain goods to any destination. There are no formal regulations to ensure that export proceeds in foreign currencies are surrendered within a certain period from the date of shipment, but the collection of export proceeds is mandatory. Export duties are levied on animals and specified agricultural goods, such as bananas, cocoa, nutmeg, coconuts, copra, cotton, and limes and related products. Proceeds from Invisibles The collection of the foreign currency proceeds from invisibles is mandatory. Travelers may bring in freely notes and coin in Eastern Caribbean currency or in any foreign currency. Capital All outward capital transfers require exchange control approval. The purchase by residents of foreign currency securities and of real estate abroad for private purposes is not normally permitted. Certificates of title to foreign currency securities held by residents must be lodged with an authorized depository in Grenada, and earnings on these securities must be repatriated. Personal capital transfers, such as inheritances to nonresidents, require exchange control approval, which normally is granted subject to the payment of estate and succession duties. There are certain allowances for cash gifts (EC$500 a person a year) and for emigration purposes. The Ministry of Planning, Finance, and Trade will also consider transfer applications from foreign nationals who have resided in Grenada and are proceed- ing to take up permanent residence abroad. Direct investment in Grenada by nonresidents may be made with exchange control approval. The remittance of earnings on, and liquidation proceeds from, such invest- ment is permitted, provided that all liabilities related to the investment have been discharged and that the original investment was registered with the Ministry of Planning, Finance, and Trade. Nonresidents may acquire in Grenada real estate for private purposes with funds in foreign currency; local currency financing is not ordinar- ily permitted. The repatriation of the proceeds from the realization of such investments requires the approval of the Ministry of Planning, Finance, and Trade. The approval of the Ministry is required for residents to borrow abroad or for nonresidents to borrow in GRENADA Grenada. Authorized dealers may freely assume short- term liability positions in foreign currencies for the financing of approved transfers in respect of both trade and nontrade transactions. They may also freely accept deposits from nonresidents. Any borrowing abroad by authorized dealers to finance their domestic operations requires the approval of the Ministry. Gold Residents who are private persons are permitted to acquire and hold gold coins for numismatic purposes only. Residents other than the monetary authorities, authorized dealers, and industrial users are not permitted to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry or coins for numismatic purposes.

Not for Redistribution GUATEMALA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Guatemala is the Guatemalan Quet- zal. Guatemala maintains a three-tier exchange rate system: in the "official" market, the exchange rate is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at the rate of Q 1 = US$1; in the banking market, the rate is determined by market supply and demand; in the third or "auction" market, the rate in principle fluctuates according to market forces but also may be set by the Central Bank taking into account developments in the second market. In the first (or official) market the Central Bank buys foreign exchange at the rate of Q 1 = US$1; eligible transactions at this rate include: (a) for- eign exchange proceeds from official borrowing; (b) foreign exchange earnings from exports of coffee and sugar under quotas, exports of bananas, cardamom, and petroleum and 80 percent of export proceeds from sugar outside quota, cotton, and meat, as well as all other exports to destinations outside the Central American Common Market (CACM); (c) payments for imports defined as essential by the Government; (d) payments of principal and interest on external public debt and private external debt registered with the Bank of Guatemala as of November 16, 1984; (e) all other official transactions; and (f) authorized outward remittances to university students and for medical treatment. All other transac- tions take place in the second (or banking) market at a fluctuating rate. In addition, the Bank of Guatemala is empowered to sell foreign exchange on an occasional basis for use in importing certain products designated by the Bank; the rate in this third, "auction," market might either result from a bidding process or be set by the Bank of Guatemala taking into account the value of the quetzal in the banking market. Authorized banks may operate in the banking market. Sellers of foreign exchange through this market receive domestic currency at the official rate plus a negotiable certificate denominated in U.S. dollars for an amount equivalent to the value of foreign exchange surrendered; the certificate may be sold in the local market at a rate above the official rate and the purchaser is allowed to buy the specified amount of foreign exchange at the official rate in the local banks. Exchange certificates have a maturity of eight days. On December 31, 1984 the buying and selling rates for these certificates in terms of the U.S. dollar were 48 percent and 49 percent, respectively, above the official rate. No operations were conducted through the "auction" market in 1984. Buying and selling rates for certain other currencies1 are also officially quoted, mainly on the basis of their 'Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Mexican pesos, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. 232 rates in the New York market. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. On January 27, 1947 Guatemala formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control The Foreign Exchange Department of the Bank of Guatemala is in charge of administering the Emergency Regime for controlling international transfers. Foreign exchange transactions of the public sector are carried out exclusively through the Bank of Guatemala, while those of the private sector are made through banks authorized by the Monetary Board. Essential payments in foreign currency must be approved by the Foreign Exchange Department; banks participating in the system may authorize some foreign payments under powers dele- gated by the Bank of Guatemala. Exports of goods and services must be registered in the Foreign Exchange Department to guarantee the repatriation of the corre- sponding foreign exchange proceeds. Prescription of Currency In practice, most transactions in foreign exchange are denominated in U .S. dollars. Transactions with three other member countries of the CACM2 are carried out in national currencies through the Central American Clear- ing House; clearing settlements are made in U.S. dollars. Transactions with Nicaragua are carried out in U.S. dollars. Imports and Import Payments Imports originating outside the Central American region which qualify for foreign exchange at the official rate of Q 1 = US$1 are subject to prior licensing from the Bank of Guatemala. Imports of items considered "essential" by the Government and which may be effected at this rate include some basic foodstuffs, medicines and pharmaceutical products, printed matter and paper, basic inputs for agriculture, and most fuels and lubricants. All other imports should be effected through the banking market. Imports of essential goods from Central America in excess of Q 100 in each case require registration with the Ministry of Economy. Import licenses issued by the Ministry of Economy are required for imports of maps of Guatemala, coffee beans and coffee plants, explosives, lead, poultry, milk, eggs, sugar, wheat flour, basic food- grains, cottonseed, tallow, and a few other goods. Imports of cacao are prohibited from all sources. Imports from Honduras are regulated by a bilateral trade agree- ment. All merchandise imports must be registered with 2Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Honduras. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution the Foreign Exchange Department or one of the autho- rized banks (imports from other Central American countries covered by the General Treaty for Economic Integration of Central America are exempt from this requirement); the Bank of Guatemala w i ll issue foreign exchange licenses for import payments only against original bills of lading and invoices w i th statistical information consistent with the import registration. Except in the case of imports made directly by autho- rized banks on behalf of importers w i th letters of credit or trade credits, a 25 percent guarantee deposit, to be made at the time of requesting foreign exchange, is required in the case of prepayments for imports. De- posits may be made in cash, bank guarantees, or government bonds and are refundable when the Bank of Guatemala has received from the importer a document issued by customs verifying the arrival of the merchan- dise. In the case of imports made through particular letters of credit, a m in imum of 60 percent guarantee deposit is required, but imports made through credit lines are exempted. Requests for payments by the public sector are exempted from this purchase requirement. Under the provision of the Central American Agree- ment on Fiscal Incentives, Guatemala grants duty exon- erations on imports of raw materials and capital goods to approved industrial firms. Imports originating outside the Central American Common Market are subject to an import surcharge of 30 percent of the applicable import du ty. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles The following categories of current invisible transac- tions are effected at the official rate of Q 1 = US$1: (a) interest payments on the public and registered private external debt; (b) all other official payments and receipts; (c) certain remittances for university studies abroad; and (d) payments for medical treatment abroad. Remittances abroad for studies at university or equivalent level should cover the following expenses: (i) tuition and related payments, (ii) once-a-year round trip transportation, (iii) an initial allowance equivalent to Q 1,000 for settlement, and (iv) monthly remittances of up to the equivalent of Q 500, which may be increased by up to Q 300 by the Exchange Department of the Bank of Guatemala in duly justified cases. Foreign exchange for medical treatment abroad may be provided in advance by the Exchange Department, including that needed for transportation and hospitalization expenses; in duly justified cases, foreign exchange to cover expenses of an additional person may be provided. At the time of requesting foreign exchange in advance for medical treatment abroad, a 25 percent guarantee deposit should be constituted in the form of cash, bank guarantees, or government bonds; the guarantee deposit is refundable at the time of presentation of documents ju s t i fy ing the use of foreign exchange abroad. All other current invisible transactions may be effected without l im it through the banking market. GUATEMALA Exports and Export Proceeds Certain exports are subject to licenses issued by the Ministry of Economy. Exports of a few other items are prohibited, inc lud ing the export of gold (unless the Bank of Guatemala issues a special export license) and silver in any form. Travelers may, however, take out up to Q 25 in silver coin that is legal tender in foreign countries. Exporters must obtain an export permit issued by the Foreign Exchange Department before the Guatemalan customs can authorize shipment of the merchandise; the granting of export permits is contingent on agreement to sell export proceeds to the Bank of Guatemala or an authorized bank w i th in six months of the date of issuance. Exchange earnings from some categories of exports are required to be surrendered to the Bank of Guatemala at the rate of Q 1 = US$1 as follows: (a) 100 percent of proceeds from coffee and sugar exports to quota markets, and from exports of bananas, cardamom, and petroleum; and (b) 80 percent of those from exports of sugar outside quota, cotton, meat, and all other exports to outside the Central American Common Market. All other export proceeds may be converted at the banking market rate. Export taxes are levied on a number of traditional export items (coffee, cotton, sugar, beef, shrimp, and bananas). Capital Proceeds from official external borrowing and prin- cipal repayments on the external debt of the public sector are effected at the rate of Q 1 = US$1. Similarly, principal repayments on the outstanding external debt of the private sector registered with the Bank of Guatemala as of November 16, 1984 can be effected at the rate of Q 1 = US$1. All other capital transactions take place at the rate in the banking market w i thout limitations. All investment by foreign or foreign-controlled companies in the construction of private housing in Guatemala re- quires the prior approval of the Ministry of Economy. Investment in the petroleum sector is governed by special legislation. Gold The Bank of Guatemala is obliged to purchase all gold offered to it, either directly or through the banks, and is entitled to require the surrender, directly or through authorized banks, of the gold holdings of any resident. The Bank sells gold to domestic artistic or industrial users, in accordance w i th directives of the Monetary Board. The export of gold is prohibited except when the Bank of Guatemala issues a special export license. Gold is imported only by the Bank of Guatemala. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement November 16. A three-tier exchange rate system was introduced. In the first market, the official exchange rate continued to be pegged to the U .S. dollar at the rate 233 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GUATEMALA of Q 1 = US$1; transactions channeled through this market included most export receipts, proceeds from official borrowing, debt service payments on the external public and registered private debt, all other official transactions, imports of "essential" goods, certain remit- tances abroad to students, and payments for medical treatment. In the second (banking) market the exchange rate would fluctuate freely; all transactions not specific- ally required to be channeled through the official or the third market would be effected through this market. The third, or "auction" market, would be administered by the Bank of Guatemala and would be supplied on an occasional basis with foreign exchange from the official market to be used for imports of certain products designated by the Bank of Guatemala; the rate in this market would either result from a bidding process or may be set by the Bank of Guatemala taking into account the rate in the banking market. Imports and Import Payments November 16. In connection with the introduction of a three-tier exchange rate system, it was announced that only imports of goods defined as "essential" would be permitted to be effected through the official market. The list of "essential" imports included certain foodstuffs, medicines and pharmaceutical products, agricultural inputs, printed matter and paper, and most fuels and lubricants. All other imports were to be effected through the banking market, except those for which, on an occasional basis, the Bank of Guatemala would provide foreign exchange at a rate either determined through bidding or set by the Bank. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles February 27. It was announced that in bona fide cases, exceptions to the existing limits on requests for foreign exchange would be permitted for the following invisible transactions: (1) expenditures for students abroad; (2) outward remittances for family maintenance; (3) remittances of domestic earnings to Guatemalan residents abroad; and (4) remittances of foreign workers' earnings in Guatemala. November 1. The foreign exchange allowance for tourist travel was reduced from the equivalent of US$2,000 a person a year to the equivalent of US$400 a person a year. The new allowance was to be used exclusively to cover in full or in part the cost of transportation; previously, the foreign exchange allow- ance could also be used to cover other expenses. November 16. In the context of the establishment of a three-tier exchange rate system, foreign exchange financing for all current invisible transactions other than interest payments, official transactions, certain student remittances, and payments for medical treatment abroad was shifted to the banking market. Exports and Export Proceeds November 16. In the context of the establishment of a three-tier exchange rate system, it was announced that 20 percent of proceeds from exports of sugar outside quota, cotton, meat, and all other exports to destinations outside the CACM, and 100 percent of proceeds from exports of coffee and sugar outside quota and all exports to destinations within the CACM were to be converted in the banking market. At the same time, the maximum permissible period for the surrender of export proceeds was extended from three to six months. Capital November 16. In the context of the establishment of a three-tier exchange rate system, foreign exchange financing for all capital transactions other than public sector flows and principal repayments on outstanding private external debt registered with the Bank of Guatemala as of November 16, 1984, was shifted to the banking market. 234 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GUINEA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Guinea is the Guinean Syli, which is pegged to the SDR at GS 24.6853 = SDR 1. Exchange rates for 14 currencies1 quoted by the Central Bank of the Republic of Guinea are determined on the basis of the value of the syli in terms of the SDR and the transaction value of these currencies in terms of the SDR. Exchange rates for the CFA franc and the Mali franc result from the relationship between these currencies and the French franc. Exchange rates for other currencies2 are deter- mined in accordance with the appropriate cross rates in international markets. Application of the official ex- change rate is limited for the time being to exchange transactions effected through the official channel; all other exchange transactions are effected through a tolerated but strictly illegal parallel market. Transactions under the bilateral payments agreement with the People's Republic of China are settled in renminbi at the rate of GS 10.030 per Y 1. Administration of Control Exchange control authority is vested in the Central Bank, which is under the direct supervision of the Presidency. The Bank has not delegated any of its exchange control powers. All settlements with foreign countries, including payments for imports, require ap- proval by the Central Exchange Bureau of the Central Bank. Import and export licenses are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Trade, within the framework of annual import and export programs. Prescription of Currency Settlements on account of transactions covered by bilateral payments agreements are made in currencies prescribed by, and through accounts established under, the provisions of the agreements.3 Settlements with the Central Bank of West African States (for Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Niger, Senegal, and Togo) and The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are normally made through the West African Clearing House. Set- tlements with other countries are made in designated "convertible" currencies quoted by the Central Bank. Nonresident Accounts There are two types of nonresident accounts: Nonresi- dent Transferable Accounts in Foreign Currencies and 'Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Sierra Leonean leones, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. 2Principally, the Saudi Arabian riyal. 3 Guinea maintains bilateral payments agreements with Algeria, the People's Republic of China, Cuba, and Viet Nam; all but the agreement with China are inoperative. Nonresident Accounts in Sylis. The opening of a nonresident account is subject to the prior approval of the Central Exchange Bureau. Imports and Import Payments Import licenses are of two types: "licenses with settlement" and "licenses without settlement" (i.e., imports are financed by the importers' own foreign exchange). The first type of license is mainly for those imports of the public enterprises and ministries that are part of the import program, while the second type of license is for the private sector imports. An annual program of imports is presented by each public enterprise and forwarded to the respective minis- try, which aggregates its overall import needs before forwarding them to the Minister of Foreign Trade. These requests are discussed by an interministerial committee (commission de contrdle des licenses), which has the ultimate authority to decide on the final composition of imports; on this basis, annual import quotas are allocated to each ministry. If one ministry's requirements should exceed its quota, it would have to make a special request to the interministerial committee; the determining crite- rion in such cases is the urgency of the need. In any case, any extra amount allowed beyond the original quota would normally be deducted from the quota for the following year. The execution of the import program is closely monitored to ensure that actual imports comply with the authorities' imports. Should the foreign ex- change situation permit, an annual program could be expanded in favor of the import of necessities. Once an import license has been issued, authorization for the corresponding payment is granted by the Central Exchange Bureau. Imports by foreign concession holders require import licenses for statistical purposes only and are not restricted. The annual import program takes into consideration the sources of imports and the availability of convertible currencies and of balances under payments agreements. Certain imports, including most private sector im- ports, are effected outside the import program. This category comprises goods for which foreign exchange is derived from sources other than the official foreign exchange resources of Guinea and covers mainly imports by two "mixed-economy companies" (the Friguia Com- pany and the Guinea Bauxite Company), the foreign embassies, imports made directly for the execution of the Five-Year Plan, and imports by private traders not involving purchase of foreign exchange through the official market (sans reglement financier). Pharmaceut- ical supplies and fuel can be imported only through the official channel by the public sector. All commodities are subject to import surcharges, except when imported by the "mixed-economy companies." 235 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GUINEA Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles through the official foreign exchange market require the authorization of the Central Exchange Bureau. Payments for freight and insurance in connection with imports are authorized as part of the import license. No official exchange is granted for other types of insurance with companies abroad. There is no official exchange allocation for tourist or business travel; each application is considered individually. Government officials on official missions are permitted an allowance of GS 600 a day. Pilgrims are granted exchange up to the equivalent of GS 16,351 for each pilgrimage and, in addition, up to GS 22,000 to pay for fares. In cases of serious illness, where a doctor's certificate is submitted, residents are granted foreign exchange for medical care abroad or are permitted to transfer exchange for the care of relatives receiving medical treatment abroad. Indi- vidual authorization is required for the payment in Guinea of all fares for foreign travel. Payments for family support through the official market may be made up to monthly amounts determined on the merits of the case; for officially recognized study abroad, the allocation is the equivalent of the amount of a government scholarship, that is, GS 2,500 a month, but students beginning their studies abroad are granted an additional foreign exchange allowance of up to GS 4,000. The Foreign Investment Law guarantees that at least 20 percent of the net annual profits of approved foreign investments may be transferred abroad through the official market; the percentage actually permitted depends on the agreement concluded between the enter- prise concerned and the Government. Expatriate workers employed by the public sector in Guinea may transfer abroad through the official market 40 percent of their net monthly salaries, and those employed by the private sector are permitted to transfer up to 30 percent of their net monthly salaries on the same basis. The export of Guinean currency is prohibited. Exports and Export Proceeds The Minister of Foreign Trade establishes an annual export program for all public sector exports except those of the "mixed-economy companies." All exports require individual licenses in order to (1) assure the implementation of the export program (particularly in respect of commitments under bilateral trade agreements); (2) permit the Treasury to levy certain duties (e.g., special taxes payable in foreign exchange are levied on the volume of bauxite and alumina exported); (3) prevent shortages of goods needed for domestic consumption; and (4) prevent the export of capital. For the following commodities, special authori- zation from designated agencies is required in addition to the export license: wild animals (dead or alive), edible animals, articles of historic or ethnographic interest, jewelry, articles made of precious metals, and plants and seeds. An export license is granted only when the 236 exporter assumes the obligation to surrender the pro- ceeds immediately after they are collected. Foreign planters may be granted special transfer privileges related to the quantity of pineapples, bananas, or citrus fruits exported, and private traders may also be permitted to retain a part of their export proceeds in order to finance authorized imports. The mixed-economy companies are allowed to retain their export proceeds abroad, to pay for their imports and operating require- ments, and to service their external debt. For diamond producers, there is an auction arrangement operated by the Central Bank, under which producers are paid 60 percent of proceeds in foreign currency and the remainder is converted at the official exchange rate. Proceeds from Invisibles In principle, exchange proceeds accruing to residents in respect of invisibles are required to be surrendered. The import of foreign bank notes and traveler's checks is permitted freely, subject to declaration on entry, but both must, in principle, be surrendered within 24 hours after entry. Nonresident travelers may repurchase and re- export the foreign exchange declared upon entry, after deduction of their local expenditures; this deduction may not be less than the equivalent of US$20 for each day of their stay, unless evidence can be produced to show that actual expenditure was less. The import of Guinean currency is prohibited. Capital All capital transfers through the official market require authorization. Outward capital transfers by Guinean nationals through the official market are prohibited. The Foreign Investment Law of April 5, 1962 provides guarantees against the nationalization of foreign invest- ments in the industrial and mining sectors. It also provides for preferential tax and customs treatment applicable to foreign investments and for the transfer of profits, interest, amortization, and liquidation proceeds of such investments. Under a special investment law passed in August 1977, freedom of movement and other privileges are granted to funds remitted and placed in Guinean banks by nonresident Guineans. In accordance with the terms of the Investment Law of February 1, 1980, small and medium-size enterprises in which at least GS 25 million is invested over a 3-year period may receive tax exemptions for a period of 7 to 10 years. Exemptions for up to 25 years may be granted on long- term investments of particular importance to the econ- omy. There are arrears on external payments, mostly in respect of debt service payments. Gold Guinea has four issues of commemorative gold coin, which are legal tender. Furthermore, residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Guinea for numismatic purposes. With these exceptions, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GUINEA not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Changes During 1984 Administration of Control May 9. The state-trading agency (IMPORTEX) was abolished, and its powers temporarily transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Trade. Imports and Import Payments May 9. In connection with the abolition of IMPORTEX, the power to issue import licenses and to prepare the annual public sector import program was transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Trade. May 9. In connection w i th the dissolution of IMPOR- TEX, authorization was granted for private sector import- ers to import items previously monopolized by IMPOR- TEX: namely, educational supplies, sugar, rice, and flour. Exports and Export Proceeds May 9. With the abolition of IMPORTEX, the power to issue export licenses and to prepare the annual export program was transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Trade. 237 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GUINEA-BISSAU (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Guinea-Bissau is the Guinea-Bissau Peso. Guinea-Bissau follows a flexible exchange rate policy under which the exchange rate of the Guinea- Bissau peso in terms of the SDR is adjusted at relatively short intervals on the basis of domestic price devel- opments, external market conditions, export trends, and the overall balance of payments position. Daily buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, and for other foreign currencies are fixed within margins of 2.25 percent of the SDR rate for the Guinea-Bissau peso. On December 31, 1984 the buying and selling rates of the National Bank of Guinea-Bissau (the central bank) for the U.S. dollar were PG 127.25 and PG 127.98, respectively, per US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Foreign exchange transactions are under the control of the National Bank of Guinea-Bissau (the central bank). Foreign exchange proceeds must be surrendered to the central bank. Residents must declare to the central bank all their physical assets and foreign exchange holdings abroad. Prescription of Currency Settlements with all foreign countries must be made in foreign currency. The central bank may prescribe the currency in which export earnings shall be received. Guinea-Bissau maintains a bilateral payments agreement with Algeria. Settlements with the Central Bank of West African States (for Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Niger, Senegal, and Togo) and The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are normally made through the West African Clearing House. Imports and Import Payments All imports are subject to prior licensing. In principle, licenses are issued by the Ministry of Commerce and Tourism in line with availability of foreign exchange and on the basis of a program agreed between the central bank and the Ministry of Commerce and Tourism. Licenses are valid for the period of the import transac- tion. Licenses granted have to be presented to the central bank within 15 days. Only importers registered with the Ministry of Commerce and Tourism may receive licenses. Each license specifies the quantity and value (c . i . f. and f .o .b .) of the product imported, and a separate license is required for each product. Retail traders receive imported products in proportion to their exports of agricultural products, and private exporters of non- traditional products are authorized to use up to 70 per- 238 cent of their foreign exchange receipts to pay for merchandise imports. Licenses for project-related im- ports financed by foreign loans or grants are granted automatically. Import licenses are normally provided within 8 to 15 days of a documented request. Imports of essential foodstuffs, such as rice and sugar, are state monopolies. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require the prior approval of the Committee of Foreign Exchange Control. Foreign exchange allocations for many payments for invisibles, including those for tourism and for the purchase of stocks, bonds, real estate, and profit remittances, have been temporarily suspended. Transfers of pension pay- ments are authorized in accordance with specific criteria. Although no foreign exchange may be purchased for tourism, airplane tickets can be bought using domestic currency. Airline companies may transfer in foreign exchange the difference between their payments and receipts in Guinea-Bissau pesos. These transfers are approved on an ad hoc basis. Foreign exchange allowances for business travel are limited to PG 30,000 a trip. For study abroad foreign exchange is granted up to PG 13,800 each month (PG 9,000 for high school students). Allowances for travel for health reasons are permitted up to PG 65,000. Remittances to close relatives (parents and children) living abroad are permitted. Foreign travelers may take out any remaining foreign currency declared upon entry. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports require an export license. Only exporters registered with the Ministry of Commerce and Tourism may obtain export licenses, which are granted auto- matically in most cases. Exports of groundnuts are reserved for the Government and are effected by two state companies, the People's Stores and SOCOMI. Other products exported only by the Government include palm kernels, sawn wood and logs, shrimp, fish, beer, nonalcoholic beverages, groundnut oil, and parquet flooring. Private exporters of nontraditional products are authorized to use up to 70 percent of their foreign exchange receipts to pay for merchandise imports. All exports are subject to a general fee of 1 percent, and certain exports are also subject to export taxes. All export proceeds must be surrendered to the central bank. A special regime applies to exports destined for countries of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Proceeds from Invisibles Travelers may bring in any amount of foreign cur- rency. Foreign airline companies must cover the excess of their expenditures over revenues in Guinea-Bissau ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GUINEA-BISSAU pesos by transfers from abroad or by the sale of their foreign exchange receipts for Guinea-Bissau pesos. All proceeds from invisibles must be surrendered to the central bank. Capital Foreign investment operations are guided by the Investment Code introduced in 1980. Under this Code, which is being reviewed, exchange control is exercised over capital receipts and payments. Capital transfers associated with emigration are authorized by the "transi- tory norms" within a monthly limit of PG 50,000 and up to 20 percent of total taxable income earned during a period of not more than ten years. At present, however, such transfers are suspended. Gold Exports and imports of gold are prohibited, except when authorized by the Head of State and the Ministry of Finance. Changes During 1984 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 239 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GUYANA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Guyana is the Guyana Dollar, which is pegged to a basket of currencies consisting of the pound sterling, the deutsche mark, the Japanese yen, the French franc, and the Netherlands guilder. The external value of the Guyana dollar in terms of the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is announced on a weekly basis. On December 31, 1984 the official buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were GS4.247 and G$4.268, respectively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates for certain other currencies1 are also officially quoted, with daily quotations based on the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar in markets abroad. The Bank of Guyana (the central bank) charges commissions at different rates on the purchase and sale of the officially quoted currencies. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Guyana formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from December 27, 1966. Administration of Control Exchange control authority is vested in the Minister of Finance who has entrusted its administration to the Bank of Guyana. Authority for approving current payments up to specified amounts is delegated to the banks authorized for this purpose; all other import payments and certain payments in respect of current invisibles of a personal nature require the approval of the Bank of Guyana. The Ministry of Trade and Consumer Protection is responsi- ble for issuing import and export licenses, but import licenses require the endorsement of the Bank of Guyana. Prescription of Currency Exchange control applies to all countries, and all currencies other than the Guyana dollar are considered foreign currencies. Authorized payments, including pay- ments for imports, by residents of Guyana to residents of countries outside Guyana may be made in any foreign currency or in Guyana dollars to the credit of an External Account in Guyana. Receipts from countries outside Guyana may be obtained in any foreign currency (in any listed specified currency2 for export proceeds) or in Guyana dollars from an External Account. Nonresident Accounts There are two categories of accounts for persons who are not residents of Guyana: External Accounts and Blocked Accounts. 'Barbados dollars, Canadian dollars, Eastern Caribbean dollars, Jamaica dollars, pounds sterling, and Trinidad and Tobago dollars. 2Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. 240 External Accounts may be opened, with exchange control approval, for persons resident outside Guyana. They may be credited freely with all authorized pay- ments by residents of Guyana to nonresidents and with transfers from other External Accounts; other credits require approval. They may be debited freely for payments for any purpose to residents of any country, for transfers to other External Accounts, and for withdraw- als by the account holder while he is in Guyana; other debits require approval. Blocked Accounts may, in principle, be credited with funds that are not placed at the free disposal of nonresidents (e.g., certain capital proceeds); these ac- counts may be debited for certain authorized payments, including the purchase of approved securities. Since mid-1978 Blocked Accounts have been used to hold domestic currency deposits equivalent in value to pend- ing applications for foreign exchange. Such deposits carry a market-related interest rate but no exchange rate guarantee. Imports and Import Payments All imports from or that transit South Africa are prohibited. Imports of certain other commodities are also prohibited from all sources. Permissible imports are subject to individual licensing, but the following com- modities are exempted: passengers' baggage, household effects and personal effects, bona fide patterns and samples that have a stipulated f.o.b. value, parcel post items of a certain value imported by individuals, and gifts subject to certain conditions. In addition, from May 1, 1982 a scheme was to be introduced under which a manufacturer would be permitted to import spare parts up to c.i.f. value of G$5,000 and any items of equipment or machinery up to c.i.f. value of G$l0,000 without a need to apply for an import license, provided that no foreign exchange from Guyana would be required to pay for the imports; the scheme has, however, so far not become operational. An import license is granted on a relatively free but priority basis as follows: (1) raw materials for the manufacture of essential items, (2) essential items, (3) raw materials for manufacturers serving the export markets and the essential services in industry, (4) equipment and materials for sawmills in the timber industry, (5) commodities for hatcheries, (6) spare parts, (7) petroleum products, (8) importation by international organizations and diplomatic personnel, and (9) drugs. However, an application for an import license will not normally be approved for commodities when similar ones are produced locally and at reasonable levels to supply domestic needs or sustain exportation. Public sector corporations have a monopoly over the importation of specified commodities from all sources. Import licenses are issued in respect of certain specified commodities only to that government corporation which ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution has been identified to procure them centrally. When the responsibility of handling imports of any commodity has been given to a single government agency with a view to eliminating duplication of ordering between such agen- cies, the relevant licenses are issued only to that corporation. A similar course of action is adopted when standardization of commodities is involved. As a general rule, licenses are issued only to government corporations for the procurement of supplies for the retail and distributive sectors of the economy where responsibility is to order on a national, rather than a local basis. Licenses are not normally made available to private sector concerns or individuals for goods to be disposed of by retail trade, other than to dealers in spare parts. Import licenses continue to be approved for specialized requirements of government and private concerns con- nected with sugar, bauxite, rice, timber, and manufac- turing industries, as the case may be. There are no import quotas, but the granting of import licenses is subject in large measure to the availability of foreign exchange. All applications for foreign exchange must be accompanied by a domestic currency deposit of equivalent value, to be held in blocked accounts with commercial banks. Commercial banks are required to maintain a 100 percent reserve requirement against these deposits at the Bank of Guyana. There has been an accumulation of commercial arrears. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to all countries require ap- proval, which, except for tourist travel, is usually given freely, provided that no illegal capital transfer is in- volved, but there has been some accumulation of arrears. The basic annual exchange allocation for tourist travel is G$200 a person and is not cumulative. The allocation for education depends on each circumstance and is granted in terms of foreign currency needs. Resident and nonresident travelers are subject on departure to an exit tax of G$50 a person. Persons traveling abroad may take with them Guyana currency notes not exceeding G$40; these notes do not form part of any allotment of exchange for travel. The equivalent of up to G$60 may be taken out in actual currency notes as part of the foreign exchange allowance for foreign travel. Nonresident travelers may, within one month of their last entry, freely take out any foreign currency notes declared upon entry. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. Rice may be exported only by the Guyana Rice Board, sugar only by the Guyana Sugar Corporation, and bauxite and alumina only by the Guyana Mining Enterprise Limited. Certain other exports also are channeled through official agencies. Most exports do not require export licenses, but transactions are supervised by the Bank of Guyana and the Customs and Excise Department to ensure that the exchange proceeds are repatriated and, if obtained in GUYANA listed specified currencies (see footnote 2), surrendered. Exchange control forms have to be completed for all exports exceeding G$200 in value. Proceeds from Invisibles Specified currencies (see footnote 2) received on account of invisibles must be sold to an authorized bank, but other currencies may be retained by the recipient. Travelers may bring in freely any amount in foreign bank notes; domestic bank notes up to a value of G$40 may be brought in by returning travelers only. Capital Private investment, both foreign and domestic, is governed by the Private Investment Code of 1979. Foreign investors must apply to the Bank of Guyana for approved status for new investments at the time of investment in order to be able to repatriate capital. Such approval is normally given for direct investments in new projects that would benefit the balance of payments or the economy of Guyana; "approved status" assures that profits may be remitted, and that upon liquidation of the investment, the proceeds, including any capital incre- ments after payment of all taxes, may be repatriated in full in the currency of the original investment. For the time being, however, foreign-based companies and their subsidiaries can borrow in Guyana only with the express approval of the Bank of Guyana. The export of capital by residents is not normally permitted. Listed specified currencies (see footnote 2) obtained by residents through capital transactions must be surrendered to an authorized bank, but other curren- cies may be retained by the recipient. Emigrants of Guyanese nationality may not transfer abroad any part of their capital assets other than a settling-in allowance of G$100 for each member of a family unit; emigrants of foreign nationality may export all declared capital assets, an amount of G$24,000 a family unit at the time of emigration, and G$17,300 in each successive calendar year. Borrowing from nonresidents requires exchange con- trol approval. However, publicly owned enterprises are encouraged to borrow abroad for the financing of specific projects and in some instances for working capital purposes. Since mid-1979 any borrowing by a public sector corporation is subject to prior approval by the Government Debt Committee. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Guyana for numismatic purposes, and also jewelry. With these exceptions, residents other than the monetary authori- ties, authorized dealers, producers of gold, and autho- rized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form, at home or abroad, without special permission. Neither the Bank of Guyana nor any other official institution purchases gold to supply domestic industry. Imports and exports of gold in any form by or 241 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GUYANA on behalf of the monetary authorities, authorized deal- ers, producers of gold and industrial users, require licenses issued by the Ministry of Trade. Residents traveling abroad are allowed to take out with them jewelry up to a value of G$2,OQO, G$l,500, and G$500, for women, men, and children under 12 years of age, respectively. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement January 11. The exchange rate for the Guyana dollar was changed from G$3.00 = US$1 toG$3.75 = US$1, representing a depreciation of 20 percent. In addition, the basket of currencies on the basis of which the external value of the Guyana dollar would be determined was modified to include the pound sterling, the deutsche mark, the Japanese yen, the French franc, and the Netherlands guilder. October 5. It was announced that, with effect from October 6, the exchange rate of the Guyana dollar would be announced weekly on the basis of the basket of currencies introduced in January 1984. (This action necessitated a change in the classification of the ex- change arrangement of Guyana from a system of "flexibility limited in terms of a single currency (U .S. dollar)" to one of a "currency pegged to other compo- site.") For the week beginning October 6, 1984, the central rate for the Guyana dollar was set at G$4.12 = US$1, representing a depreciation of 9 percent from the previous rate of G$3.75 = US$1. 242 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution HAITI (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Haiti is the Haitian Gourde, the parity of which is defined in terms of the SDR, but in such a way as to preserve the relationship of G 5 = US$1. The official buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar are G 5 = US$1. The U .S. dollar circulates freely and is generally accepted in Haiti. Sales of foreign exchange are subject to a local tax of 0.20 percent. Commercial banks quote buying and selling rates for certain other currencies, based on the buying and selling rates of the U .S. dollar in markets abroad. On December 22, 1953, Haiti notified the Fund that it formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sec- tions 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control The administration of the foreign exchange system is under the control of the Bank of the Republic of Haiti (the central bank) and exchange transactions are imple- mented by that Bank and certain commercial banks. The tax code provides for a penalty, payable to the tax authorities, equal to 20 percent of any commercial foreign exchange transaction not conducted through a bank established in Haiti. Aside from this requirement, there is no exchange control, and there are no obligations prescribing the method or currency for payments to or from nonresidents. Imports and Import Payments Importation of certain consumer goods is regulated by an order of November 3, 1982. Import licenses are required for, inter alia, certain foodstuffs, certain foot- wear, cotton textiles, paints, specified household goods, and iron rods. In principle, these products are subject to global quotas which are distributed among importers on the basis of established market shares. In practice, however, the Ministry of Commerce applies specific quotas only when the local market is perceived clearly as being flooded by a particular imported item, threatening a complete displacement of local production.! The importation of used automobiles is subject to the require- ment that the vehicle is at most five years old and has been owned by the importer for a minimum of two years. Imports from member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance require prior authorization by the Ministry of Commerce. The Ministry's prior authorization is also required for imports from any source of specified types of footwear and of a few other items that are controlled for other than balance of payments reasons. The domestic marketing of certain !W i th the exception of milk and batteries, import quotas are not fixed in advance for specified products. imports is controlled by the State Tobacco Monopoly.2 A consular fee of 2 percent is payable on all imports in the country of origin except for materials required by certain export industries. A unified and simplified system of import tariffs came into effect in May 1981. Importers pay a sales tax of 7 percent on the amount of their imports.3 All merchandise shipments to Haiti are subject to qualitative and quantitative verification by the Swiss company Societe Generate de Surveillance (SGS). Exports and Export Proceeds Exportable commodities require prior authorization from the Office de Promotion des Denrees Exportables. Export authorization is usually granted freely but may be withheld when domestic supplies are low. Exports of coffee are subject to a 19 percent duty for light coffee and a 24 percent duty for natural coffee. Exports of essential oil extracts are regulated by the Marketing Office for Aromatic Oils. A minimum of 50 percent of foreign exchange proceeds from all exports is required to be held at the commercial banks for the use of the central bank. Exporters are required to negotiate documentary drafts with local commercial banks to ensure the repatri- ation of their export proceeds. The customs administra- tion will refuse export approval unless such drafts are cleared by the central bank. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments for invisibles are not restricted. Residents traveling abroad must pay a tax of G 60 on tickets and must buy a G 25,000 travel insurance policy by paying a premium of G 52; diplomats and staff members of international organizations are exempt. Arrears in re- spect of debt service payments arise from time to time. Capital Capital transfers abroad are not normally permitted but imports may be made freely. Foreign investment in Haiti is regulated by the decrees of March 13, 1963, October 8, 1969, and December 31, 1984, and requires prior government approval. Permission is not normally granted to nonresidents for investments in handicraft industries. Under a decree of April 6, 1973, private banks operating in Haiti are required to keep in the form of domestic assets a minimum of 85 percent of their liabilities to local customers. 2On January 21, 1985, the General Directorate of Taxes was established under the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Indus t ry, and in replacement of a number of existing institutions, including the State Tobacco Monopoly. 3On January 17, 1985, a du ty of 1 percent was imposed on all imports. 243 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution HAITI Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Haiti for num isma t ic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. The Bank of the Republic of Haiti has the exclusive right to purchase gold domestically and to export gold in the form of coin, mineral dus t, or bars. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry carried as personal effects by travelers may be made only by the Bank of the Republic of Haiti; exports require in addition prior authorization by the M in is try of Commerce and Industry and the Ministry of Finance, as well as an endorsement by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry before customs clearance. However, commercial imports of articles containing a limited amount of gold, such as gold watches, are freely permitted and do not require an import license or other authorization. Several gold coins have been issued, which are legal tender but do not circulate. Changes During 1984 Exports and Export Proceeds April 3. It was announced that the Customs Adm in is- tration would not grant approval of export, unless export documentary drafts previously stamped by a local com- mercial bank had been cleared with the Bank of the Republic of Haiti (the central bank). June 29. The central bank concluded an agreement w i th the commercial banks, under which the latter were required to hold for the use of the central bank up to 50 percent of the foreign exchange proceeds from exports. (Previously the banks were required to surren- der to the monetary authorities all the foreign exchange proceeds from "traditional," but not manufactured, exports.) August 2.

Not for Redistribution HONDURAS (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Honduras is the Honduran Lempira, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at L 2 = US$1. The official buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar are L 2.00 and L 2.02, respectively, per US$1. Bank notes in Costa Rican colones, Guatemalan quetzales, Nicaraguan cordobas, and Salvadoran colones are purchased at parity rates with a 1 percent commission and are sold at parity rates. The buying and selling rates for other currencies that are of significance to the foreign trade of Honduras are fixed daily on the basis of the buying and selling rates of the currency concerned against the U.S. dollar in foreign markets. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. On August 19, 1950, Honduras formally notified the Fund that it had assumed the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, beginning on July 1, 1950. Prescription of Currency There are no regulations prescribing the method of currency for payments to or from nonresidents. Pay- ments among member countries of the Central American Common Market (CACM)1 in respect of trade and invisibles are settled every six months in the domestic currency of the payer through the Central American Clearing House. If the outstanding balance is in excess of US$12 million, immediate settlement is required. Payments to and from Colombia in respect of merchan- dise trade and invisibles are settled on a six-month basis in U.S. dollars through a reciprocal credit arrangement between the member central banks of the Central American Clearing House and the Bank of the Republic of Colombia. Payments to Mexico in respect of mer- chandise trade and invisibles are settled on a four- monthly basis in U .S. dollars under a similar agreement between the member central banks of the Central American Clearing House and the Bank of Mexico. There are monthly quotas on the amount of lempira notes and coins that can be purchased by the central banks of other CACM countries,2 similar to those imposed by these countries on the purchases of their currencies by the Central Bank of Honduras. Beginning August 1983, all lempira-denominated payments amounting to at least L 1,500 processed through the Central American Clear- ing House in respect of trade and trade-related transac- tions with Mexico, Colombia, and member countries of the CACM require prior authorization from the Central Bank of Honduras. 'Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. 2Costa Rica was exempt from the quota. Imports and Import Payments Import permits are required for all items and are issued by the External Financing Department of the Central Bank. Imports are categorized according to those that must be paid for in cash (mainly nonessential imports) and those that can be financed with credit. The purpose of the classification is to discourage the import of luxury goods by denying them foreign credit and limiting their access to domestic credit by setting portfolio ceilings. A priority scheme for the approval of import permits has been established on a temporary basis, with the intention of further restraining the demand for nonessential im- ports; the scheme includes five categories with specified maximum waiting periods in each case. Importers using their own sources of foreign exchange receive an import permit within five days. Imports may be checked for appropriate pricing; import prepayments are subject to certain restrictions on the means of settlement. As a restraint on import prepayment, central bank authoriza- tion is required when payments for imports by bank drafts exceed US$5,000. Imports from CACM member countries in excess of US$25,000 in each case are also subject to prior authorization by the Central Bank. Depending on the foreign exchange situation, the Foreign Exchange Department of the Central Bank may subject the allocation of foreign exchange for imported goods and services to a set of policy-determined priorities. 3 A 100 percent guarantee deposit is required against all requests to open sight letters of credit for import payments; the deposits are held with commercial banks.4 Importers are also required to deposit with the Central Bank the lempira equivalent of requests for official foreign exchange that are not granted within a specified waiting period. Importation of corn, rice, sorghum, beans, and potatoes is the monopoly of the Honduran Institute of Agricultural Marketing (IHMA). Under the provisions of the Central American Agree- ment on Fiscal Incentives, Honduras grants duty exoner- ations on imports of raw materials and capital goods to approved industrial firms. Most imports from countries outside the CACM are subject to customs duty. Imports from the CACM are 3The Central Bank is authorized to allocate foreign exchange in accordance w i th the following priorities: external financial payments, essential consumer items, health products, educational materials, fuel and lubricants, raw materials, agricultural and industrial inputs, machinery, equipment, and spare parts, and other goods and services. 4Prior to May 1982, when this practice was introduced, the requirement had already been put in operation by a number of local commercial banks whose foreign correspondents had been requiring of them an equivalent deposit of foreign currency at the time that the letter of credit was confirmed. Since local branches of foreign banks were not subject to the same requirement, the Central Bank decided to generalize the practice in order to equalize the position of all commercial banks with respect to their opportunities for financing foreign trade. 245 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution HONDURAS subject to customs duties ranging from zero to 35 percent, under bilateral trade agreement. Some goods are subject to a customs surtax of 12 percent of the duty and to a consular charge of 8 percent of the f.o.b. value. There is a duty-free zone in Puerto Cortes. Exports and Export Proceeds Any export with a value exceeding US$1,000 requires a license and is subject to prior authorization of the External Financing Department of the Central Bank. All foreign exchange proceeds must either be surrendered to the Central Bank or to authorized banks and institutions, or be held as dollar-denominated deposits with commer- cial banks. The withdrawal of dollar-denominated de- posits is subject to compliance with the procedures on the use of foreign exchange. In general, the surrender of export proceeds must be made within 90 days following the negotiation of export documents. The Central Bank is authorized to require banks to sell to it foreign exchange holdings in excess of established limits. Exports of coffee are supervised by the Honduran Coffee Institute (!HCAFE), and exports of bananas by the Honduran Banana Corporation (COHBANA). Exports of corn, rice, beans, and potatoes are controlled by the Honduran Institute of Agricultural Marketing (IHMA), and lumber exports are channeled through the Honduran Forest Development Corporation (COHDEFOR). There is an export tax on cattle, meat, and sugar, and a general export duty of 1 percent of the f .o .b. value of all other export items except bananas, coffee, cattle, meat, sugar, minerals, and nontraditional products. The export pro- motion law enables nontraditional exports to receive a reduction in payments of indirect taxes. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles are either subject to a surrender requirement or must be held as dollar- denominated deposits with commercial banks. All pur- chases of foreign exchange in excess of US$5,000 require prior approval of the Central Bank. For statistical purposes, however, all buyers of foreign exchange are required to file an application stating how such funds will be used. Within this limit, persons traveling abroad may purchase foreign currency notes and coins in an amount not exceeding US$100 a person. There are no restrictions on the import of foreign bank notes by travelers. Capital The authorization of the Minister of Finance and approval by the Central Bank are required for all activities involving the receipt of foreign exchange resources and their transfer abroad for purposes of 246 investment in mutual funds, housing developments, real estate, or similar activities. Foreign mutual funds and similar financial institutions require permission to collect funds in Honduras for deposit or investment abroad. The approval of the Ministry of Finance, the National Planning Council (CONSUPLANE), and the Central Bank is required for the public sector to contract any foreign indebtedness, whether for import financing or for other purposes. The contracting of external debt by the private sector requires approval by the Central Bank. External debt contracts must be registered with the Central Bank, which provides foreign exchange for the servicing of only duly registered and approved external debt. The contracting of external financing must conform with specified priorities. Sight and term deposits in foreign currency at the banks are subject to a reserve requirement of 30 percent; the reserve requirement for certificates of deposit of US$25,000 and above is 20 percent, and 15 percent for savings deposits in foreign currency with savings and loan associations. Foreign exchange hold- ings in excess of specified limits may be required to be sold by the banks to the Central Bank. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Hon- duras for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and autho- rized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Central Bank; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, industrial users, and producers of gold. All locally produced gold is exported in the form of ore for refining. Commercial imports and exports of jewelry and other articles containing gold require licenses issued by the Ministry of Economy; for most articles, these are granted freely. Exports of gold are subject to a tax of 5 percent. Changes During 1984 Imports and Import Payments July 1. A regulation was introduced requiring import- ers to deposit in the Central Bank the lempira equivalent of requests for official foreign exchange that were not granted within a specified waiting period. Exports and Export Proceeds October 8. Regulations were approved that exempted nontraditional exports from the 1 percent export tax and entitled such exports to a reduction in payment of indirect taxes. The rebates of indirect taxes would be based on the national value added of the industry and the amount exported above a specified base level. ©International Monetary Fund.

The authorities do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions. Starting on October 17, 1983, certificates of indebtedness denominated in Hong Kong dollars and issued by the Government Exchange Fund, which the two note-issuing commercial banks are re- quired to hold as backing for their Hong Kong dollar note issues, are issued only against payment of U .S. dollars at a fixed exchange rate of HK$7.80 = US$1; payments by the Exchange Fund on surrender of certifi- cates of indebtedness to it when the note issue declines are also made in U.S. dollars at the same exchange rate. By arrangement, other licensed banks also pay or receive U.S. dollars at this same rate when they draw bank notes from or surrender them to the note-issuing banks. With these exceptions, the exchange rate for the Hong Kong dollar is freely determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, though influenced by the fixed rate that applies to note-issue transactions. The authori- ties do, however, retain a capability to intervene in the market. On December 31, 1984 the middle rate in the interbank foreign exchange market for the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, was HK$7.8230 = US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control There is no exchange control. Import and export licensing is carried out mainly by the Director of Trade. Prescription of Currency No prescription of currency requirements are in force. Settlements between residents of Hong Kong and non- residents may be made and received freely in Hong Kong dollars or any other currency. Nonresident Accounts No distinction is made between resident and nonresi- dent accounts. Imports and Import Payments Imports are free from licensing control, except for certain dutiable commodities, items controlled for health, safety, or security reasons, and textiles that are subject to licensing control for surveillance reasons. Imports of rice are subject to a quota system operated by 1 Hong Kong is a nonmetropolitan territory in respect of which the United Kingdom has accepted the Fund's Articles of Agreement. the Department of Trade. With a few exceptions, a trade declaration must be lodged with the Customs and Excise Department within 14 days of importation in respect of each consignment of goods imported into or exported from Hong Kong. Payments for permitted imports may be made freely, at any time, and in any currency. Exports and Export Proceeds Export licenses are required for a small number of items to enable Hong Kong to fulfill its international obligations and for health, safety, or security reasons. Textiles are also subject to licensing control because of a number of bilateral arrangements with specified coun- tries under which the export of certain textiles is restricted. Export proceeds may be collected at any time and in any currency. They need not be repatriated or surrendered. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles There are no limitations on payments for or receipts from invisibles. Resident and nonresident travelers may freely bring in and take out any amount in domestic or foreign banknotes, traveler's checks, and other means of payment. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or payments by residents or nonresidents. A license is required before any company, whether incorporated in Hong Kong or elsewhere, can do banking business in Hong Kong. Subject to certain conditions, an overseas bank can establish a representa- tive office in Hong Kong and may also register a subsidiary as a deposit-taking company. A deposit- taking company may not, however, conduct banking business or use the word "bank" in its title. Gold There is a free market for gold in which dealings by residents and nonresidents are unrestricted. Imports and exports of gold in any form (including finished jewelry) are freely permitted and do not require licenses. Resi- dents may hold gold in any form in Hong Kong or abroad.

Not for Redistribution HUNGARY (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Hungary is the Hungarian Forint. The exchange rate of the forint against currencies other than those of the member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA),1 Albania, and the Dem- ocratic People's Republic of Korea, is derived on the basis of a weighted basket of nine currencies;^ the weights are adjusted annually and reflect the currency composition of Hungary's export receipts from the nonruble currency area. The value of the forint in terms of the basket is adjusted at irregular intervals, on the basis notably of the difference between the domestic and foreign rates of inflation. Exchange rates are quoted by the National Bank of Hungary for 19 convertible currencies3 and the National Bank stands ready to effect transactions in any of these currencies. Buying and selling rates are set with a spread of Vw of 1 percent around the middle rate for each currency. 4 New rates are quoted once a week (on Tuesday)5 and, in the case of the currencies included in the basket, are based on the average exchange rates between these currencies in international markets during the previous five working days. Rates for other curren- cies are based on the quoted rate for the U.S. dollar and the dollar rates for the currencies concerned in interna- tional markets. The exchange rate of the forint against individual currencies need not be changed if the adjust- ment relative to the previous quotation would be less than l/2 of 1 percent and if cumulative changes in the value of the forint relative to the basket would not exceed 1 percent during the calendar year. The buying and selling rates for spot transactions in U .S. dollars on December 31, 1984 were Ft 51.1478 and Ft 51.2502, respectively, per US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Although there are no official forward quotations, the National Bank is prepared to buy currencies forward for exports and related transactions. Rates are set on a case- by-case basis and reflect forward quotations in interna- tional markets. 1 The member countries of the CMEA are Bulgaria, Cuba, Czecho- slovakia, German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, U .S .S .R ., and Viet Nam. 2Austrian schillings, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. Each of these currencies accounts for at least 1 percent of export receipts. 3Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Kuwa i ti dinars, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Portuguese escudos, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. In addition to the above, exchange rates for bank notes and traveler's checks are quoted for Greek drachmas and Yugoslav dinars. 4The spread of 0.2 percent between buying and selling rates applies to spot telegraphic transactions. For traveler's checks and bank notes, a 6 percent spread is maintained between buy ing and selling rates. 5 Beginning from January 1, 1985, new exchange rates are quoted on a daily basis. 248 The largest portion of Hungary's trade and financial settlements with the member countries of the CMEA is settled in transferable rubles through the International Bank for Economic Cooperation (IBEC) and with Al- bania and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in clearing rubles. Official exchange rates for the transfer- able ruble and the clearing ruble are, in principle, quoted weekly (see footnote 5) by the National Bank, although these rates remain fixed for longer periods. At the end of December 1984 the buying and selling rates for the forint against the transferable ruble were Ft 25.974 and Ft 26.026, respectively; the same rates applied to the clearing ruble. The National Bank also quotes rates of exchange for the forint against the currencies of member countries of the CMEA, Albania, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. These rates are used for noncommercial settlements, for example, international travel, expenses of diplomatic representation, scholar- ships,6 and are based on multilateral agreements or, in some cases, on supplemental bilateral agreements. Administration of Control The authority for enforcement of foreign exchange regulations is vested in the Minister of Finance. Related functions are exercised by the Minister through the National Bank, except for those functions reserved for the Minister himself or delegated to other institutions, such as the Hungarian Foreign Trade Bank and the Central Corporation of Banking Companies. The Na- tional Bank may entrust other agencies, such as banking institutions and travel agencies, with the performance of specified tasks. The Central European International Bank Ltd., established jointly by the National Bank and Western European and Japanese interests, is exempt from Hungarian foreign exchange regulations and re- strictions in respect of authorized activities. Foreign trade is a state monopoly. In practice, this means that commercial exports and imports may be effected only by economic enterprises authorized for this purpose. Organizations that are not authorized to con- duct foreign trade channel their imports and exports through authorized organizations. At the end of Decem- ber 1984 there were 218 enterprises7 authorized to engage in foreign trade on a permanent basis, of which 39 were specialized foreign trade organizations;8 the rest consisted of industrial enterprises, state farms, coopera- tives, and domestic trading concerns. In addition, appro- vals for ad hoc foreign trade activities were granted in 80 cases during 1984. Authorization to enter into foreign trade may thus be either general or specific, referring in 6 A commission of 3 percent applies to purchases from tourists of bank notes in the currencies of member countries of the CMEA. 7 Thirty-two additional enterprises were granted foreign trading rights on January 1, 1985. 8In addition, there were n ine enterprises specializing in the represen- tation of foreign enterprises. ©International Monetary Fund.

Prescription of Currency Payments to and from countries with which Hungary has multilateral and bilateral payments agreements are made in the currencies and in accordance with the procedures set forth in those agreements.9 If there are no specific agreements, or if trade takes place outside the scope of the agreements, settlement is made in a convertible currency. Nonresident Accounts Nonresident juridical and physical persons may main- tain convertible currency accounts at the National Bank, at certain designated offices of the National Savings Bank, and at the Foreign Trade Bank; only relatively large amounts may be placed at the National Bank. The accounts carry tax-free interest, payable in the currency of deposit, and have a guarantee of repayment but no exchange rate guarantee. Nonresident deposits at the National Bank earn rates of interest set on a competitive basis with those in international markets. Interest rates on nonresident deposits at the National Savings Bank at the end of December 1984 ranged from 2 percent to 15.25 percent a year, depending on the currency and the maturity of the deposit and reflecting the financial market situation. No authorization is required to open such accounts or to draw on them. Unless specifically exempted, payments in forints to nonresidents must be deposited in blocked forint ac- counts at certain designated offices of the National Savings Bank. Approval authority for withdrawals from blocked forint accounts has been delegated to the National Savings Bank for specified uses, for example, living expenses while traveling in Hungary, medical expenses, and certain personal and family-related ex- penses; approval may be obtained on the basis of a verbal declaration. Requests for approval for other uses must be referred to the National Bank. All requests for rea- sonable purposes are granted. In general, no interest is paid on these accounts. Residents may also open accounts at designated offices of the National Savings Bank either in foreign currencies or in forint convertible into foreign curren- cies.

Convertible currency income or assets from these sources may be deposited in these accounts up to the extent of the first Ft 15,000 and up to 25 percent of the excess a year (in the case of inventors, up to 30 percent of the fees from foreign sales of licenses and products under licenses). No limits apply to income from these sources earned in the currencies of countries accounting in rubles. In addition, reasonable amounts of savings from per diem payments, wages and salaries derived from employment abroad, scholarships, and artistic performances may be deposited in these ac- counts. Separate accounts are kept for deposits made in convertible and CMEA currencies. No authorization is required for the use of accounts of residents in foreign currencies or in forint convertible into foreign currencies. Withdrawals of convertible currency balances can be made in any convertible or CMEA currency, in Yugoslav dinars, or in forint. CMEA balances can only be withdrawn in a CMEA currency or in forint. The deposits may be used for foreign travel or to purchase foreign goods through the Consumex and the Intertourist shops or directly from abroad against payment in convertible currencies. De- posits of more than one-year maturity earn interest at rates prevailing in international markets. Residents can also hold another category of accounts called the BC foreign currency accounts. Deposits in these accounts are limited to transfers from nonresidents to residents for the purpose of financing residents' expenses while traveling abroad. Such deposits can be used in lieu of a nonresident's affidavit in applying for a visitor's travel visa (see below). Imports and Exports All imports and exports are subject to a licensing requirement. Licenses are issued by the Licensing Department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade. No further license from the foreign exchange authority is required for export or import and the performance or use of related services. Import licenses may be global or individual and, unless otherwise specified, are valid until the end of the calendar year for which they are issued. Global licenses allow the transaction to take place w i th any country for the goods and services specified in the license; such licenses are used primarily for bulk imports of items, such as fertilizer and steel products, which are spread over the course of the year. Individual licenses permit transactions to take place only as specified. A fee equivalent to 1 percent of the forint value of licensed imports settled in convertible "currency is levied. Imports are subject to import duties and a 1 percent customs fee upon customs clearance. An advance import deposit scheme introduced in 1967 remains in place but has not been activated since 1971. Separately, a forint cover requirement applies to both imports and investment f inanc ing. In the case of imports, 249 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution HUNGARY the importer is required to deposit the forint equivalent of the value of the letter of credit in a blocked noninterest- bearing account at the National Bank when opening a letter of credit. When importing on behalf of other end- users, foreign trade organizations can obtain payment from the end-user up to a maximum of 15 days before the due date for payment by the latter. The due date for payment can relate either to the date when a letter of credit is to be opened or for imports against documents or acceptance, to the date of payment. In the case of investment financing, a letter from the National Bank confirming that financing for the project has been secured in full is required before spending can be initiated. The related financing is frozen in a noninterest- bearing account at the time the letter is issued by the National Bank. In the case of imported capital goods, the letter must be submitted to the licensing authority before the import license is issued. Apart from the import of consumer goods settled in convertible currencies, the licensing of imports was quasi-automatic and was used essentially for the purpose of ensuring that only authorized enterprises engaged in international trade. Beginning in September 1982, im- ports of several, mainly primary products were made subject to quotas. In addition, the regime for imports settled in the convertible currencies was applied more restrictively: imports of capital goods, other imports by large and frequent importers in excess of specified quarterly limits, and all imports by other importers were subject to individual approval on the basis of the availability of foreign exchange. These restrictions were gradually lifted during the course of 1983 and 1984; by the end of 1984, the quasi-automatic licensing system in effect before September 1982 has been virtually fully restored. Imports of consumer goods settled in convert- ible currencies are subject to a global quota, the dollar value of which is published annually in the Foreign Trade Gazette. The value of the quota for 1985 was set at US$170 million. Licenses against the quota are granted on an order-of-arrival basis, and unused allocations are not automatically added to the quota for the next year. Licenses are generally applied for by the enterprises authorized to engage in foreign trade. Settlement in foreign exchange is authorized and effected upon receipt, and according to the terms, of valid documents for settlement. Ex post verification of compliance with the terms of the license is made by the foreign exchange authority twice a year. Certain imports are prohibited for sanitary, security, and other non- economic reasons. Hungary has been a member of the GATT since 1973. As part of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations (MTN), the arithmetic average tariff level applied on a most- favored-nation basis is to be reduced from 24.9 percent in 1979 to 16.1 percent in 1987; the weighted average tariff level is also showing a decreasing trend, to 11.0 percent in 1983. Imports from developing countries enjoy preferential tariff treatment. A part of these imports, however, is subject to special import turnover 250 taxes aimed at equalizing the prices of such imports and prices in the domestic market. In general, returning Hungarian travelers may import, free of customs duty, goods for noncommercial use up to a value of Ft 6,000. Returning residents may import, free of customs duty, goods up to a value equivalent to 40 percent of their earnings while stationed abroad for more than one year. Border trade is conducted on the basis of intergovernmental agreements. Certain exports are prohibited for sanitary, security, and other noneco- nomic reasons. In addition, an export subsidy may be applied to exports of agricultural products and processed foods settled in convertible currencies, amounting to not more than 8 percent of the value of the agricultural raw material content of these exports. The tax refund and the subsidy are calculated on the basis of the customs invoice value. Most trade with member countries of the CMEA, Albania, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, is conducted under bilateral agreements negoti- ated annually within the framework of five-year bilateral trade and payments agreements. Trade within this framework takes place at prices fixed in the annual bilateral agreements, on the basis of quotas representing delivery obligations, with determined conditions of delivery. Subsidies may be paid to compensate exporting enterprises for losses incurred if such exports are required for the fulfillment of the agreements' obligations. All foreign assets and currencies must be declared and all foreign exchange assets must be surrendered, unless otherwise exempted. Declaration must be made within eight days, but the length of time allowed for repatriation depends on the nature of the case. The Foreign Trade Bank is generally exempt from the obligation to surren- der its foreign exchange assets to the National Bank. The National Savings Bank and the General Banking and Trust Company are exempt from the surrender require- ment in certain cases; specific exemptions for individuals are granted in respect of gifts received while traveling and used to cover living and shopping expenses while abroad, as well as for wages and salaries earned while working abroad with official permission, or from schol- arships received from nonresidents. Receipts of foreign currency not exceeding Ft 2,000 (in bank notes only) a person are also generally exempted from the surrender requirement. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles related to merchandise trans- actions, including transportation and advertising, are freely granted. Generally, other invisible transactions exceeding Ft 5,000 require general or individual authori- zation by either the Ministry of Finance or other competent authority. Foreign exchange for related pay- ments is made available automatically once the transac- tion has been authorized. Budgetary or social institutions may obtain general authorizations for transactions up to specified amounts in ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution connection with their own activities. General authoriza- tion up to specified amounts or proportions of turnover is given to enterprises engaging in foreign economic activities for the purpose of defraying expenses other than those directly related to trade. Such authorizations relate to expenses for travel and other expenses, such as the maintenance of foreign representation and related personnel expenses. Compliance with the conditions of the general authorizations is reviewed on an ex post basis by the Ministry of Finance, the chief control administra- tion of the Ministry of Finance, and the National Bank. Permission for travel to countries outside the CMEA area is granted only upon evidence of means of support abroad. This requirement can be met in one of three ways: (1) if living expenses while abroad are covered by nonresidents, in which case an affidavit from the nonresident or the availability of sufficient funds in a resident BC account at Touring, Money Changing, Traveling and Shipping Co., Inc. (IBUSZ) is required; (2) if living expenses while abroad are covered from the resident's own funds in a convertible currency account or from a travel allowance obtained from the National Bank; or (3) if traveling with an authorized tourist group. Travelers under the first category are labeled "visitors," while travelers under the latter two categories are labeled "tourists." Permission for private travel may be obtained once a calendar year. Authorized tourist offices obtain annual foreign exchange allocations for granting allow- ances to tourist groups. Foreign exchange allowances for travel to countries outside the CMEA may be obtained from the National Bank once every third year. Individual allowances amount to Ft 15,200 a passport holder plus Ft 2,400 a child for children of less than 14 years of age traveling under a parent's passport. Small amounts may also be granted on a case-by-case basis in excess of the basic allowance for personal reasons, for example, if certain additional transport must be paid for abroad. In general, transportation expenses for "tourists" can be settled in forint for Hungarian carriers or carriers participating in a pooling agreement of which the domestic carrier is a member. Transportation expenses for tourists can be settled in forint for any other carriers using the less expensive fares when the destination of travel cannot be reached by the above-mentioned carriers. The same regulations apply to visitors when traveling by air or long distance coach. In the case of tourists, a supplementary travel allowance may be obtained for travel by car to cover gasoline expenses up to a quota fixed for each country. Visitors may purchase foreign currencies up to Ft 2,200. For official and business travel, separate allowances are established by the Ministry of Finance for living expenses and accommodation. Limits for living ex- penses are applied strictly, while accommodation allow- ances are applied more f lex ib ly to reflect actual rea- sonable costs. Compliance w i th these limits is adminis- tered by the enterprises or institutions themselves w i th in their allocated global foreign exchange quotas and is HUNGARY reviewed, on an ex post basis, by the Ministry of Finance, the chief control administration of the Ministry of Finance, and the National Bank. No m in imum spending or conversion requirement applies to nonresident travelers to Hungary, except in the case of visitors from Yugoslavia, who are required to convert the equivalent of Ft 760 a trip (Ft 380 for residents of the border area) when entering Hungary other than for business purposes. (Yugoslav citizens arriving with an authorized tourist group are, however, not covered by this regulation.) For travel between Hungary and Poland and between Hungary and Czecho- slovakia, travelers are required to have in their posses- sion specific m in imum amounts of the currency of their country of destination. Nonresidents may take out of the country foreign exchange assets and economic assets, in addition to their personal effects, without a license of the foreign exchange authority, provided that they have filled out a "Certified Declaration on Brought-In Assets" on arrival. In addition, nonresidents may not take out of the country articles exceeding the value of Ft 3,00010 (up to Ft 1,000 an article). Within the same overall limits, nonresidents from countries with which an agreement is in force for the reciprocal exchange of currencies (CMEA members, except Cuba and Viet Nam) may take out of the country gifts up to Ft 300 (see footnote 11) a person as well as purchased articles up to 50 percent of the amount brought into Hungary under the certification of the nonresident's foreign exchange authority. How- ever, nonresidents may take out freely articles bought in shops designated for sales in convertible currencies. Residents may, without a license from the foreign exchange authority, bring into or take out of the country domestic currency in an amount not exceeding Ft 200 a person, in denominations not exceeding Ft 50. Nonresi- dents may similarly bring into or take out of the country Ft 100 a person, in coins on ly .] l Limits of Ft 50 a person (only in coins in the case of nonresidents) apply to both residents and nonresidents, not to exceed Ft 200 a month, in the case of border-zone traff ic. Special exchange regulations apply to travel to CMEA countries as follows: residents visiting CMEA countries are entitled to an annual allowance of Ft 15,000. Except for a portion of the travel allowance (equivalent to the above-mentioned Ft 200) that may be taken out of the country in forint and converted at the travel destination, under multilateral agreement travelers to CMEA coun- tries can acquire the currency of the country of destina- tion in amounts determined by the regulations of that country. For the remainder of their allowances travelers must acquire traveler's checks denominated in the currency of the country of destination.

By multilateral agreement, no reconversion of forint acquired by CMEA tourists into their own national currency is allowed. Tourists from the convertible currency area can reconvert up to the equivalent of US$100, provided that the reconversion is for not more than half of the amount originally converted into for in t. No foreign exchange is made available for study abroad. Students' living expenses and tuition fees while abroad must be covered by scholarships or f inanc ial support from nonresident relatives. Transfers abroad by nonresident workers in Hungary, other than those em- ployed in joint ventures, are determined on the basis of agreements between domestic and foreign institutions or enterprises. Nonresident employees of jo int ventures may transfer abroad up to 50 percent of their income. Twenty percent of wages earned by Hungarian private citizens working abroad must be transferred to Hungary and converted into forint. Capital All foreign borrowing, excluding foreign borrowing on the basis of intergovernmental agreements, requires the approval of the National Bank. This approval is given only in exceptional circumstances, for example, when credits on favorable terms are guaranteed by the government of the exporter or when bankers' accept- ances are provided on favorable terms. The requirements of the economy for foreign credit are met through direct foreign borrowing by the National Bank; the aim is to prevent Hungarian enterprises from circumventing the regulations of domestic credit policy by means of foreign resources. Directives for extending short-term commercial cred- its in connection with foreign trade activities have been established jointly by the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Foreign Trade, and the President of the National Bank. No license from the foreign exchange authority is required for commercial credits in com- pliance w i th the directives. Medium-term and long-term credits for the export of investment goods may be extended by exporting enterprises with the authorization of the Minister of Foreign Trade. Negotiable export documents are discounted by the National Bank. These credits are refinanced by the National Bank from its own resources. Foreign investment in the form of joint ventures w i th Hungarian enterprises may be established subject to the approval of the Minister of Finance. Joint ventures may also be established in duty-free zones. In both cases the jo int venture is considered as a Hungarian legal en t i ty, but those in duty-free zones are not subject to several regulations. Foreign participation is limited in general to 49 percent; but a higher proportion may be allowed in the banking and service sectors. In other sectors, foreign majority requires special permission of the M in is ter of Finance. Machines and equ ipmen t, technical know-how, and patents may qua l i fy as part of foreign investment. 252 Tax benefits may be granted by the Minister of Finance. Guarantee is given for the transfer of the foreign investors' share of profits or, in the case of liquidation of the joint venture, of the invested capital. In addition, a guarantee may be obtained from the National Bank, covering losses on invested assets as a result of state measures, or from Hungarian banking institutions, cov- ering the fu l f i l lment of obligations of the Hungarian partner. Foreign investment by resident economic organiza- tions, either by establishing subsidiaries or affiliates or by acquiring an interest in a foreign enterprise, is subject to the approval of the head of the competent sectoral authority. In addition, approval is required from the Minister of Finance in his capacity as the foreign exchange authority. Except for gifts w i th a market value of up to Ft 800, the transfer of economic assets abroad by residents is subject to licensing administered by the National Bank. Gifts (movable property) from nonresidents in excess of Ft 25,000 a person are also subject to licensing. Nonresidents are not generally allowed to acquire real estate, bu i ld ings, or other immovable property in Hun- gary, except in the form of inheritance. Outward capital transfers by resident physical persons are not generally approved. For certain established categories, such as inheritances, transfers may be autho- rized on the basis of agreements and reciprocity w i th other countries, subject to the control of the Central Corporation of Banking Companies. Emigrants may take out of the country up to Ft 60,000 an adult and Ft 30,000 a child, silver objects weighing at most 1 kilogram, and gold and jewelry considered to be personal effects. Other assets of emigrants, as well as the assets of nonresidents, are held either in the care of a person designated by the nonresident owner or, in the case of financial assets, in a nonresident blocked forint account or blocked deposit. Gold All trade in gold and gold objects is subject to the authority of the National Bank and in concurrence with the competent authority in the case of industrial and artistic uses. All ingots and gold coins, except for one piece a person of every kind of gold coin minted prior to 1945, must be offered to the National Bank for sale. Except for transactions w i th enterprises specifically authorized to transact in gold, all transactions in gold are subject to licensing administered by the National Bank. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement The forint was depreciated on two occasions against the basket of currencies to wh ich it is pegged: by 3 percent on February 7, and by 5 percent on June 26.

The termination of the bilateral payments agreement with Brazil took effect; balances outstanding under the agreement by December 31, 1983 were required to be settled by June 30, 1984. Imports and Exports January 1. The coverage of quota restrictions on imports was reduced by 25 percent in terms of local currency. In addition, the reference limits for individual importing companies handling large and frequent trans- actions were defined as six-monthly rather than quar- terly, and the limits were raised by 14.4 percent, on average, relative to the first half of 1983. February 7. The fee on licensed imports settled in convertible currencies was lowered from 2 percent to 1 percent of value, and the refund of indirect taxes on exports settled in convertible currencies was reduced by 3 percentage points, to 2 percent of value. April 1. The 20 percent surcharge on imports of component parts was abolished. April 20. Following their suspension beginning from April 1, 1982, waivers began again to be granted by the National Bank in respect of forint cover for imports. July 1. In an easing of import restrictions, the reference limit scheme applied to large and frequent importers was abolished and the quasi-automatic licens- ing was fu l ly re-established, with the exception of goods covered by the six import quotas still in force. August 9. Imports of capital goods for projects covered by IBRD financing became exempt from the forint cover requirement. December 1. The rate of customs duties for accom- panying imports by travelers was lowered from 40 per- HUNGARY cent to 30 percent, and the rate for imports of cars was reduced from 60 percent to 50 percent. In addition, the duty-free allowance for imports by Hungarian travelers was raised from Ft 5,000 to Ft 6,000. A new price list of items importable by individuals was also to be prepared, which would show a lowering of customs values of some 10 percent; new lists would henceforth be published every half year to reflect evolving changes in prices. December 31. The six import quotas valid until the end of 1984 were abolished, thus eliminating all the restrictive trade measures introduced on September 1, 1982 for balance of payments reasons. Payments for Invisibles February 7. The foreign exchange allowances for travel to countries outside the CMEA was raised to the equivalent of Ft 14,500 per passport holder, plus Ft 2,300 for an accompanying traveler under 14 years of age (previously Ft 14,000 and Ft 2,200 respectively). In addition, the amount of foreign currency that visitors could purchase was raised from Ft 1,800 to Ft 2,100. June 26.

Not for Redistribution ICELAND (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Iceland is the Icelandic Krona, the exchange rate of which is determined on the basis of a trade-weighted basket of currencies. There is no organ- ized foreign exchange market in Iceland and official buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar, the principal trading and reserve currency, are quoted by the Central Bank of Iceland. These rates are adjusted from time to time; on December 30, 1984 the buying and selling rates were ISK 40.49 and ISK 40.60, respectively, per US$1. Rates for other currenciesl are based on the official rates for the U .S. dollar and the dollar rates for the currencies concerned in international markets. The authorized banks are permitted to carry out exchange transactions among themselves and to engage in arbitrage in foreign markets. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Iceland formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2 , 3, and 4 of the Fund Agreement, as from September 19, 1983. Administration of Control The Ministry of Commerce, after consulting with the Central Bank, has the ultimate responsibility for matters concerning import and export regulations and payments for invisibles. The Central Bank is responsible for the regulation of foreign exchange transactions and of exchange control, including capital controls; it is also responsible for ensuring that all foreign exchange due to residents from commercial transactions is surrendered to authorized banks and that such foreign exchange is disposed of as authorized. Three commercial banks (the National Bank of Iceland, the Fisheries Bank of Iceland, and the Agricultural Bank of Iceland), previously the only fu l ly authorized banks, were joined in 1984 by three more authorized banks (the Industrial Bank of Iceland Ltd., Iceland Bank of Commerce Ltd., and the Icelandic Cooperative Bank, all private). Prescription of Currency All exchange receipts are obtained in convertible currencies. Settlements (a) with countries whose curren- cies are usually tied to the U .S. dollar and (b) with many other countries, such as in Eastern and Southern Europe, as well as outside Europe, are made in U .S. dollars; with countries of the former Sterling Area and some other countries, in sterling; and with many other countries, in their respective currencies. 1 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Irish pounds, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. 254 Nonresident Accounts There are two categories of nonresident krona ac- counts with the authorized banks: Foreign Accounts and Special Accounts. The opening of nonresident accounts requires individual approval. Foreign Accounts may be credited with the proceeds from the sale of foreign currency to authorized banks and with authorized payments due to nonresidents from residents. Balances on Foreign Accounts may be used freely for payments to residents and may, without a license, be converted into the currency of the country of residence of the account holder. These accounts are, in practice, seldom used, payments for international trans- actions generally being made in U .S. dollars, sterling, or other convertible currencies.2 Special Accounts in kronur or foreign currency may be opened by agreement with an authorized bank. The most important of these accounts are those of foreign banks and foreign insurance companies. They may be credited freely with approved payments from residents. Imports and Import Payments All goods not on the restricted list may be imported freely without an import license from any country; most imports are liberalized. The main commodities on the restricted list are petroleum products, fishing vessels, certain agricultural goods, and specified industrial brooms and brushes. Certain imports, including fertiliz- ers, tobacco, matches, and alcoholic beverages, can be ordered freely but admitted only under state-trading arrangements. Fresh vegetables and potatoes are im- ported under the auspices of the Agricultural Production Board. For imports from all sources, when requiring a license, a fee of 1 percent is charged as a license fee on the krona value of the import license when the license is issued; for petroleum products, however, this fee is 0.1 percent. Importers of goods not requiring licenses are not required to obtain a foreign exchange permit prior to shipment from abroad, but import documentation must be presented to one of the authorized banks to obtain foreign exchange. The goods will not be cleared by the customs unless payment has already been made, or the importer has acquired a permitted foreign credit, usually by accepting a bill of exchange issued by the seller. For imports that require an individual license, foreign ex- change is granted in accordance with the terms stipulated in the license. 2 Residents who hold foreign currency wh ich they are not required to sell to authorized dealers may open Foreign Accounts with Icelandic banks. Such accounts, denominated in Danish kroner, deutsche mark, pounds sterling, and U .S. dollars, may be credited w i th authorized receipts in foreign currencies and may be debited for authorized payments in foreign currencies. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Importers may freely.accept suppliers' credit for up to 3 months from the date of arrival at an Icelandic port for listed goods corresponding to around two thirds of imports; the goods not listed are mainly certain building materials, household appliances, motor vehicles for personal use, and nonessential goods. Credit in excess of 3 months and not exceeding 12 months is permitted in respect of some categories of goods and materials, for example, in connection with the import of industrial raw materials for which the production process is lengthy. Foreign credit in excess of 12 months is subject to government authorization issued by the Ministry of Commerce. Import documentation on credit terms must be presented to one of the authorized banks prior to customs clearance. Automobiles are subject to a special import tax ranging between 7 percent and 37 percent depending on the weight of the vehicle or the engine capacity. Buses, heavy trucks, ambulances, and public service vehicles are exempt. Certain nonessential goods, whether of imported or of domestic origin, are subject to a special excise tax of 24 percent or 30 percent, ad valorem. Payments for Invisibles No exchange license is required for government payments (such as interest and amortization on external loans, expenses of the foreign service, payments to inter- national organizations, payments for postal, telegraphic, and telephone services), for banking commissions, or for bank charges on foreign exchange transactions. The authorized banks effect payments freely on most transactions on the basis of bona fide documents. There is an exchange license fee of 1 percent for all payments for invisibles. The basic allocation for tourist travel is the equivalent of US$1,500 a person for each trip abroad (US$750 for each child). Applications for foreign ex- change for chartering of ships, aircraft, and major repair of same, transactions and transfers in connection with direct insurance, and insurance operations abroad are considered on their merits. Resident and nonresident travelers may take out ISK 3,000 in Icelandic bank notes and coin in denomina- tions not exceeding ISK 100. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of fisheries and agricultural products require licenses issued by the Ministry of Commerce. The shipping documents must be lodged with an authorized bank. Exchange receipts accruing from exports must be surrendered without undue delay. Most fish products are subject to export levies, which are returned to the fishing industry through special funds. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles of a commercial nature must be surrendered. The owners of Icelandic ICELAND ships and aircraft are permitted to retain their foreign exchange receipts from freight, passenger tickets, or other charges and to use them for operating purposes and for purchases of necessities. Icelandic insurance compa- nies which reinsure abroad are permitted to retain foreign exchange earned from premiums and indemnities and to use it to pay reinsurance premiums, claims, and other regular expenditures. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in Icelandic bank notes and coin, up to ISK 3,000 in denominations not exceeding ISK 100. Capital All investments by nonresidents are subject to indi- vidual approval. The participation by nonresidents in Iceland's joint stock companies may in general not exceed 49 percent and is not allowed in the f ish ing, power, and mining industries; the case of the a lum inum plant, which is wholly owned by nonresidents, is a special exception. Nonresident-owned foreign capital entering in the form of foreign exchange must be surrendered. Nonresidents may be authorized to open nonresident accounts for these fund s, in which case their retransfer abroad is permitted. Residents are obliged to surrender foreign exchange accruing to them on account of capital transactions and payments. Without the approval of the Government, residents may not obtain loans abroad, including loans for financing imports, for periods exceeding one year. Applications for the contracting of financial credits and loans abroad for a period of less than one year are considered on their merits. Transfers of capital abroad by residents require indi- vidual approval. Direct investment abroad for the pur- pose of assisting the marketing of Icelandic products is normally permitted. Portfolio investment abroad by residents is subject to license. Outward transfers of inheritances, legacies, and emigrants' assets are subject to license and are allowed up to an annual ceiling. Nonresidents may acquire Icelandic securities and other assets with imported funds; the transfer abroad of the proceeds from their sale requires authorization. Securities held in Iceland by nonresidents must be registered with the Foreign Exchange Control of the Central Bank, and all transactions concerning them are subject to licensing. The import and export of securities by residents require central bank approval. Gold A commemorative gold coin with a face value of ISK 100 is legal tender but does not circulate. Residents may hold and acquire gold in Iceland, subject to certain legal requirements.

Exchange rates of the rupee in terms of the pound sterling, the intervention currency, are accordingly fixed periodically by the Reserve Bank; at the end of December 1984 they were Rs 14.36 buying and Rs 14.44 selling, per £ stg. 1. Exchange rates for spot and forward purchases of deutsche mark, Japanese yen, and U .S. dollars are based on the latest available rates and trends in international markets and are announced by the Reserve Bank every day; such rates may be changed at any time, if the need arises. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the cross rate of the pound sterling with the Indian rupee. The Reserve Bank stands ready to purchase currencies of certain member countries1 of the Asian Clearing Union (ACU), deutsche mark, Japanese yen, pounds sterling, and U .S. dollars, spot and forward, and to sell spot ACU currencies and pounds sterling. The Reserve Bank permits authorized dealers or money changers to fix the floor and ceiling rates for purchases and sales of U .S. dollar and pound sterling notes on the basis of a formula furnished by the Bank. The Reserve Bank fixes periodically the "notional" exchange rates for the U .S. dollar and pound sterling at which authorized dealers are required to sell to and repurchase from the Reserve Bank proceeds of deposits in Foreign Currency Nonresident Accounts. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Authorized dealers are permitted to maintain balances and positions in "permitted currencies." Permitted cur- rencies are divided into two groups, Group A consisting of 20 listed currencies2 and Group B consisting of any other foreign currency that is convertible into any of the permitted currencies in fairly active markets. Authorized dealers are permitted to buy and sell spot any permitted currency from and to banks in any currency outside the Bilateral Group .3 Authorized dealers are also permitted to buy and sell forward any permitted currency against any other permitted currency. Forward purchase or sale 1 Bangladesh, Burma, the Islamic Repub l ic of Iran, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.

On December 28, 1984 (the last working day of the year) market rates for telegraphic transfers in New York were US$8.090 buying (clean) and US$8.020 selling, per Rs 100, and the Reserve Bank's rates were US$8.09 buy ing spot and US$8.10, US$8.10, US$8.10, US$8.10, US$8.11, and US$8.11 for buying forward (for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 months' delivery, respectively), per Rs 100. The Reserve Bank provides forward cover to autho- rized dealers by purchases of sterling for delivery on any day during the first month, second month, etc., up to 9 months' delivery initially (and extendable up to 12 months), for purchases of U .S. dollars up to 12 months, and of deutsche mark and Japanese yen for delivery on any day during the first month, second month, and so on, up to the sixth month. In addition, the Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd. (ECGC) provides protection against exchange fluctuation from the date of a bid up to 15 years after the award of contract; exchange cover is offered in French francs, deutsche mark, Japanese yen, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, U .S. dollars, and U .A .E. dirhams. The Reserve Bank also purchases the currencies of the ACU member countries listed in footnote 1 from authorized dealers for delivery of up to six months on a monthly option basis. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Reserve Bank in accordance with the general policy laid down by the Government, in consultation w i th the Bank. Much of the routine work of exchange control is delegated to certain commercial banks, which act as authorized dealers. All proposals for direct investments in India, with or without equity participation, are reviewed by the Foreign Invest- ment Board. Under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, the general or specific approval of the Reserve Bank is necessary for the continuance of commercial, indus- trial, and trading activities in India of companies incorporated abroad, or with more than 40 percent nonresident interest, or for the establishment by them in India of any branch, office, or other place of business for carrying out any such activity. Import and export licenses are issued by the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports. Prescription of Currency For prescription of currency purposes, countries are divided into two groups: the Bilateral Group of countries (see footnote 3) and the External Group of countries (all other countries). Payments to and from the Bilateral Group of countries must be settled in Indian rupees through the appropriate clearing account. Payments to the External Group of countries may be made in rupees to the account of a resident of any country in the group or 257 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INDIA in any permitted currency.4 Receipts from the External Group of countries may be obtained in rupees from the account of a bank situated in any country in the group or in any permitted currency. However, special rules may be applicable in respect of exports under lines of credit extended by the Government of India to the governments of certain foreign countries. In addition, all payments on account of current international transactions (other than travel, export and import transactions involving set- tlement on deferred payment terms, and imports into Bangladesh under the wage earners' scheme) between India and other members of the ACU (see footnote 1), except Nepal, are required to be settled through the ACU arrangement. Nonresident Accounts The accounts of Indians and of Bhutanese and Nepal- ese nationals resident in Bhutan and Nepal, as well as the accounts of offices and branches of Indian, Bhutanese, and Nepalese firms, companies, or other organizations in Bhutan and Nepal, are treated as resident accounts.5 Accounts related to all other foreign countries are treated as nonresident accounts. The treatment of these accounts distinguishes between those of banks and of others. The accounts of banks are classified in two groups corresponding to the division of countries for prescrip- tion of currency purposes, that is, the accounts of banks in the Bilateral Group of countries and the accounts of banks in the External Group of countries. Accounts of banks in the External Group of countries may be credited with payments for imports, interest, dividends, and other authorized purposes, w i th authorized transfers from the nonresident accounts of persons and firms (including banks), provided that both the transferor and the trans- feree accounts are of the same country or countries in the External Group, and with proceeds from sales of permitted currencies. They may be debited for payments for exports and for other payments to residents of India. These accounts may also be debited for transfers to nonresident accounts of persons and firms (including banks) and transfers to Nonresident (External) Accounts, provided that both the transferor and transferee accounts 4 All remittances by nationals of the People's Republic of China to any country outside India and all remittances to the People's Republic of China by any person resident in India, whether for personal or trade purposes, were stopped w i th effect from November 3, 1962. Since the resumption of trade between India and the People's Republic of China, remittances arising out of trade transactions are permitted in conformity w i th exchange control regulations. All nontrade-related transactions w i th the People's Republic of China or nationals of the People's Repub l ic of China continue to be prohibited, unless generally or specifically authorized. Authorized dealers are permitted to open rupee accounts on their books in the names of their branches or correspon- dents in the People's Republic of China or Pakistan w i thout prior reference to the Reserve Bank, but should seek direction before opening such accounts in the names of branches of Pakistani or Chinese banks operating outside Pakistan and the People's Republic of Ch ina, respectively. Authorized dealers may effect remittances to Pakistan on behalf of private importers as in the case of imports from other countries; they also may effect certain types of personal remittances in accordance w i th regulations applicable to such remittances; remittances for other purposes require the prior approval of the Reserve Bank. 5 However, residents of Nepal obtain their foreign exchange require- ments from the Nepal Rastra Bank. 258 are of the same country or of countries in the External Group. The balances in the accounts of banks in countries in the External Group may be converted into any permitted currency. All other entries on bank accounts require the prior approval of the Reserve Bank. Ordinary nonresident accounts of individuals or firms may be credited, without prior approval, for payment of dividends and interest on securities, shares, and deposits; refunds of amounts previously debited or overcharged; proceeds of remittances in appropriate foreign currency or transfers from appropriate nonresident banks' rupee accounts (see section on Prescription of Currency, above); proceeds of foreign exchange tendered by the account holder during a temporary visit to India; pro- ceeds from checks issued by the Life Insurance Corpora- tion in respect of maturity or death claims and the surrender value of policies held by nonresidents, provided that the Corporation certifies that premiums had been received in India in an approved manner and that actuarial reserves were held in India; all legitimate dues accruing in India to the account holder, such as pensions, provident fund s, gratuities, bonuses from a former employer, income tax refunds, etc.; and proceeds of checks, provided that the aggregate of such credits during a month does not exceed Rs 2,000 and no individual credit is in excess of Rs 750. When the nonresident account holder is an Indian national, credits on account of withdrawals or loans from, and maturity proceeds of investments in, the Public Provident Fund Scheme, 1968, rentals from and sale proceeds of real estate owned by the account holder, and maturity proceeds of all types of securities, as well as proceeds from the sale of securities sold on stock exchanges in India and the repurchase price of units issued by the Unit Trust of India are freely allowed. Indian emigrants may maintain ordinary nonresident accounts, as may overseas corporate bodies or trusts in wh ich at least 60 percent ownership or beneficial interest is held directly or indirectly but ultimately by nonresident Indians, and provided that the initial deposit for opening such an account by these bodies or trusts is made from remit- tances abroad or from funds in India otherwise eligible for credit to these accounts. When the account holder is a foreign national of Indian origin, authorized dealers may credit the sale and maturity proceeds of all types of securities and the repurchase price of un i ts, provided that the securities were originally purchased either w i th funds held in the account or by remittance from abroad, and in the case of sale proceeds, that the sale was made on a stock exchange. Proceeds from the sale of shares owned by the nonresident account holder, whether he is an Indian national or a foreign national of Indian origin, may be freely credited to his account if the shares were sold with the approval of the Reserve Bank. The special regulations covering funds lodged in National Defense Remittance Scheme Special Accounts were abolished in April 1979, and such accounts are now treated as ordinary nonresident accounts. Authorized dealers may debit the ordinary rupee accounts of nonresidents for ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution (a) local disbursements other than for payments toward investments in India and booking of international pas- sages, but transactions amounting to Rs 10,000 or more must be reported to the Reserve Bank on an ex post basis, and (b) payments toward investments in Unit Trust of India, National Plan or Savings Certificates, and Securities of the Central or State Government. Nonresident (External) Accounts may be opened by authorized dealers in India for persons of Indian nation- ality or origin resident outside India or for overseas companies and partnership firms which are owned at least 60 percent by nonresidents of Indian nationality or origin. Such accounts may also be opened for eligible persons during temporary visits to India against the tender of foreign currency traveler's checks, notes, or coin. They may be credited with new funds remitted through banking channels from the country of residence of the account holder or from any country in the External Group. They may also be credited with the proceeds of foreign currency traveler's checks, personal checks, and drafts in the name of the account holder, as well as foreign currency notes and coin tendered by the account holder during his stay in India, and also with income on authorized investments. The transfer of funds from other Nonresident (External) Accounts or Foreign Currency (Nonresident) Accounts of the same account holder is also allowed. The accounts may be debited for disburse- ments in India and for transfers abroad. Debits on account for investment in government securities and units of the Unit Trust of India, and transfers to other Nonresident (External) Accounts of the same account holder are freely allowed. Balances can also be used for purchases of foreign currency or rupee traveler's checks or traveler's letters of credit for the use of the account holder, his family and dependents, and its directors and employees in the case of corporate entities, but transfers of funds from an individual account to a similar account of another person are ordinarily not permissible. Invest- ments in the shares of Indian companies or in partnership firms, etc., or in immovable property can be made with the specific approval of the Reserve Bank. Interest on deposits in such accounts is exempt from income tax and is transferable. The balances held in such accounts are exempt from wealth tax. Foreign Currency (Nonresident) Accounts denomi- nated in pounds sterling or U .S. dollars may be held in the form of term deposits by persons of Indian national- ity or origin who are resident in the External Group of countries and by overseas companies specified above. These accounts may be credited with amounts received through normal banking channels, including interest, which is free of income tax and wealth tax. Balances may be repatriated at any time in the currency of denomination, without reference to the Reserve Bank. Balances can also be used for the purposes for which debits to Nonresident (External) Accounts are allowed. Imports and Import Payments The Imports and Exports (Control) Act of 1947 empowers the Central Government to prohibit, restrict, INDIA or otherwise control imports. Under this Act, the Imports (Control) Order, 1955 was issued, which specified items subject to controls. All imports require import licenses or a customs clearance permit unless otherwise exempted.6 Imports of gold, silver, currency notes, bank notes, and coins are controlled by the Reserve Bank of India. Imports from Namibia (South West Africa) and South Africa are prohibited. There are two types of actual user licenses: General Currency Area Licenses and Specific Licenses (used for imports from specified countries). There is a further classification of licenses as follows: automatic licenses, supplementary licenses, Import Re- plenishment (REP) licenses, capital goods licenses, Advance Licenses, Imprest Licenses, and additional licenses. Licenses issued for capital goods are valid for 2 years and all other licenses mentioned above are valid for 18 months. The Import Policy for fiscal year 1984/85, which came into effect on April 12, 1984, with its subsequent amendments, contains the policy governing imports. The import policy divides products into three basic cate- gories: consumption goods; raw materials, components, consumables, tools, and spare parts; and capital goods. Imports of consumption goods are prohibited except for certain essential products that are canalized and items that can be imported under the personal baggage scheme by Indians returning from abroad.7 Imports of raw materials, components, and spare parts for industry are classified into four categories: (1) automatically permis- sible, (2) limited permissible, (3) restricted (nonpermiss- ible), and (4) canalized. All items not included on these lists are freely available under Open General License (OGL). Nonresident Indians returning home, for the first 12 months after their return may import all raw materials except restricted (nonpermissible) items and canalized items under OGL, subject to a value limit for the purpose of setting up small industries. Licenses for automatically permissible items (automatic license) are issued auto- matically for a value equal to 110 percent of past consumption. The 110 percent level will be considered as 120 percent in the case of an actual user (industrial) who has exported at least 10 percent of his production of specified products in either of the two previous years. The actual user (industrial) may also import, within the value of the automatic license, limited permissible and canalized items subject to value limits for each item, provided that the total of all such items imported does not exceed 10 percent of the value of the license. Imports in 1984/85 can be made against the 1983/84 automatic license on a repeat basis, provided that the license value does not exceed Rs 200,000. Customs authorities will allow the repeat facility automatically without need of endorsement by the licensing authority. Actual users 6The exempted category includes government imports under Open General License, relief supplies, and passenger baggage. 7 Items that can be imported under the personal baggage scheme include air-conditioner un i ts, refrigerators, deep freezers, cooking ranges, washing mach ines, television sets, tape recorder sets, record p lay ing sets, movie cameras and projectors, video cassettes, textile fabrics, cigarettes, cigars, and tobacco. 259 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INDIA who availed themselves of a similar "repeat operation" facility in 1983/84 can apply for automatic licenses in 1984/85 for the value of the previous license. Supple- mentary licenses may be obtained in case of need, even for the import of limited permissible items. All licenses to industry are issued against free foreign exchange. There are special procedures applicable to imports of capital goods. Specified capital goods are restricted, while other listed goods and capital goods required by returning Indians to set up small-scale industries may be imported under OGL, subject to certain conditions. For other capital goods, licenses are granted subject to prescribed procedure. In general, licenses are granted after it has been certified that such imports are essential (essentiality certificate), unavailable from domestic sources (indigenous angle clearance) and, where the value of imports exceeds Rs 2 million, that the importer has advertised his requirements for a period of 45 days. However, imports of capital goods and technology are approved by the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports under a "one-window clearance procedure" provided that such imports reduce costs by at least 10 percent and that the importer exports at least 25 percent of his output. For 13 industries and projects, capital goods may be im- ported on the basis of global tenders, irrespective of whether the goods are manufactured in India or not. However, importers are required to study domestic availability of suitable equipment before calling for tenders. The selection of suppliers on the basis of global tender is subject to scrutiny by a committee headed by the Department of Heavy Industry. For imports of capital equipment for power generation transmission and distri- bution, applicants must obtain prior clearance from the latter committee before calling for global tenders. Sub- ject to specified conditions and relative value restriction, exporters are entitled to import capital goods against their own and acquired Import Replenishment Scheme (REP) licenses without an essentiality certificate and without indigenous angle clearance. Nonresident Indians returning home to settle may import capital goods other than restricted items and certain specified items (paper mill machinery, cigarette-making machinery, and fish- net-making machinery in certain cases), subject to a maximum of Rs 2 million, for the purpose of setting up or investing in an enterprise. Under the Import Replenishment Scheme, licenses are issued to merchant exporters, manufacturer-exporters, export houses, and trading houses and are freely transfer- able. Exporters are able to obtain Advance Licenses (under the Duty Exemption Scheme) or Imprest Licenses (outside the Duty Exemption Scheme) for imported inputs required for export production. The value of such licenses is debited against the REP entitlement. Regis- tered exporters are permitted to obtain REP licenses against export of specified products up to a certain proportion of the value of exports, and these licenses are valid for the importation of certain limited permissible and canalized items necessary for the production of the particular export product. The REP license entitlement is 260 increased by 10 percent for exports that are shipped in Indian vessels. Subject to a value limit on an individual item, manufacturer-exporters, export houses, and trad- ing houses are allowed to import limited permissible items up to 25 percent of the value of the REP license, provided that the value of a single item does not exceed Rs 200,000. In addition, the REP licenses may be utilized for direct imports of canalized items to the extent the license permits, and also for imports of capital goods, subject to necessary clearances and value limits. For select products where the REP rate is 20 percent or less, and provided that 50 percent or more of the production is exported, manufacturer-exporters are entitled to use 50 percent of REP licenses for imports of limited permissible items and 50 percent for canalized items. Value limits do not apply to manufacturers whose exports in the previous two years were not less than 50 percent of production and Rs 500,000. An additional REP license equal to 10 percent of the f .o .b. value of exports is provided for imports of automatic permissible items. Additional REP licenses in addition to the normal 10 percent entitlement are provided for exports of specified new products and for exports to specified new markets. Additional REP licenses based partly on net foreign exchange earnings are also available for trading houses and export houses. Trading houses receive additional licenses at a higher rate if they form longer- term relationships with associate manufacturers. Small- scale units are given especially liberal treatment in respect of import licenses, and consortia of small-scale industries may form export houses. Nonindustrial actual users, such as research and development laboratories, scientific or higher educational institutions, and hospit- als , are eligible to import their requirements of technical and professional equipment, raw materials, components, spare parts, or other items (but not office machines and consumer goods) under OGL. When a valid import license is held, the required exchange is released by an authorized bank on presenta- tion of the exchange control copy of the license and the shipping documents. License holders may make pay- ments by opening letters of credit or by remitting against sight drafts. Use of suppliers' credit and other long-term import credit is subject to prior approval. Advance remittances before shipping documents can be submitted are not normally allowed, but in special cases, for example, imports of machinery and capital goods for which deposits have to be made with overseas manufac- turers, the Reserve Bank grants special authorization for advance payment for a part of the value of the import. The import of certain commodities, including food- grains, certain oils and fats, a number of pharmaceutical products, natural rubber, raw cotton, raw ju te, cement, cashew nuts, most fertilizers, most nonferrous metals, and certain categories of steel, is reserved for the Government or state-trading enterprises ( i .e ., "canalized"), the most important of which are the State Trading Corporation (STC), the Jute Corporation of India, the Food Corporation of India, the Steel Authority ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution of India, Ltd. (SAIL), and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation. Bulk imports of certain raw mate- rials that are not reserved for the public sector may also be arranged by state agencies, under the Industrial Raw Materials Assistance Center (IRMAC) facility. In addition to any applicable import du ty, imports are subject to an auxiliary duty of up to 35 percent ad valorem. Among the exemptions are foodgrains, raw cotton, and books. Payments for Invisibles In general, payments abroad for invisibles require approval. Foreign exchange is granted freely for a few such payments, mainly for expenses incidental to trade transactions and transfers of recurring contractual obliga- tions. Premiums on insurance policies issued in foreign currency to foreign nationals not permanently resident in India are to be paid only in foreign currency; payment in rupees may be made only on annuities issued against payment from recognized superannuation or pension funds; Indian residents are prohibited from taking out life insurance policies in foreign currencies. Branches of foreign banks are not allowed to transfer abroad any profits arising from the sale of nonbanking assets. Profit remittances by branches of foreign firms, companies, and banks require the prior approval of the Reserve Bank. Remittances of dividends by Indian companies to their nonresident shareholders do not require prior Reserve Bank approval, provided that certain conditions are met. Otherwise, there are no restrictions on the remittance of profits, dividends, and interest to beneficiaries permanently resident outside India, provided that all current tax and other liabilities in India have been cleared. However, remittances of pensions and dividends and interest on shares, securities, and deposits to Indian nationals who were granted exchange facilities for emigration on or after January 1, 1963 but before April 30, 1968 are subject to an overall limit of Rs 20,000 a year. For emigrants granted lump- sum exchange facilities after April 30, 1968 on grounds of hardship, no remittance of income is allowed. Foreign nationals temporarily resident in India on account of their business, profession, or employment are permitted to make reasonable remittances to their own countries to pay insurance premiums, for the support of their families, and for other expenses. Authorized dealers may allow such remittances by foreign nationals, other than nationals of the People's Republic of China, Pakistan, and South Africa, to the extent of 50 percent of net income. Requests for the remittance of larger amounts are considered on their merits by the Reserve Bank. Under the Foreign Travel Scheme (FTS) of 1970, residents are permitted to travel abroad without "P" form formalities to all destinations, provided they have not traveled abroad under this scheme since the beginning of the previous calendar year. For determination of eligibil- ity, all foreign travel other than under the Foreign Travel INDIA Scheme is disregarded. A visit under the FTS can be combined with visits for any other purpose except tours for export promotion and other business matters, hajj pilgrimage, and travel under the Neighborhood Travel Scheme (NTS). Under the FTS, residents are entitled to foreign exchange up to US$500 or its equivalent and a round-trip ticket, irrespective of the carrier by which they travel. Authorized travel agents, airlines, and steamship companies may book passages under the FTS for any person after satisfying themselves about the intending traveler's eligibility; foreign exchange for such persons may be released by any authorized dealer after similar verification. Travel to Bangladesh, Burma, Malaysia, Maldives, Mauritius, Pakistan, Seychelles, and Sri Lanka is gov- erned by the NTS, under which residents of India visiting neighboring countries are eligible for an ex- change allowance of US$250 a person every two calendar years; this arrangement cannot be combined with the existing Foreign Travel Scheme. Authorized travel agents, airlines, and steamship companies may also book passages for persons going abroad with or without an allocation of foreign exchange (other than under the above schemes), subject only to completion of a "P" form in cases where the passage fare is paid in rupees in India. Certain categories of passen- gers, including persons traveling between India and Nepal by Indian and Nepalese airlines, deck-class passengers, and employees of airlines and steamship companies traveling abroad on business for their com- pany in one of its carriers are not required to complete a "P" form. Fares for nonresidents' journeys to and from India may be settled, without Reserve Bank approval, in rupees debited to Nonresident (External) Accounts. The export of Indian currency notes and coin, except to Nepal, is in general prohibited. The export to Nepal of Indian currency notes in denominations of Rs 100 or higher is also prohibited. However, deck-class passen- gers to Burma, Malaysia, Singapore, Gulf ports, and East Africa, and passengers to Bangladesh, Pakistan, or Sri Lanka, may take with them Rs 20 a person at any one time in Indian notes and coin. Exchange bureaus and authorized money changers are permitted to sell foreign currency notes and coin up to the equivalent of Rs 100 to travelers proceeding to Bangladesh and up to US$20 or its equivalent to those proceeding to other countries except Bhutan and Nepal. Nonresidents may take out the foreign currency that they brought in (and declared on entry if it exceeded US$1,000), less the amounts sold to authorized dealers and authorized money changers in India. Unspent rupee amounts may be reconverted into foreign currency and taken out. There is a foreign exchange allowance of up to US$750 a person for settling in and for purchase of initial equipment by students going to foreign universities w i th fu ll bursaries. A foreign travel tax at a rate of Rs 100 a passenger is levied on all passengers embarking on an international journey to any destination other than Afghan is tan, 261 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INDIA Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burma, Maldives, Nepal, Pakis- tan, or Sri Lanka. Passengers to these destinations are required to pay tax at a rate of Rs 50 a passenger. Exports and Export Proceeds Export licenses are required for some items, and most commodities may be exported without a license. In respect of controlled commodities,8 no item can be exported unless it is covered by a valid license issued by the concerned licensing authority. Exports to Namibia (South West Africa) and South Africa are prohibited. Border trade (i.e., frontier trade) between India and the Tibet region of the People's Republic of China is not allowed. Any item destined for export to Pakistan requires an export license unless it is a permissible bona fide sample or is canalized for export. Exchange control is exercised over the proceeds of exports to countries other than Bhutan and Nepal. An exporter must declare that the full export proceeds will be received and dealt with in accordance with the prescription of currency regulations. Foreign exchange holdings, including the proceeds of exports, must be offered for sale against rupees to an authorized dealer, unless the holder has been authorized by the Reserve Bank to retain them, or he is a foreign national or a foreign person of Indian origin, or he (or his foreign-born wife) is not permanently resident in India, and the funds do not represent the proceeds of an export. Export proceeds must be surrendered within six months of shipment or, if the goods are sold to Afghanistan or Pakistan, within three months of shipment. Exporters are required to obtain permission from the Reserve Bank of India through authorized dealers in the event of nonreali- zation of export value within the prescribed period. The Reserve Bank of India also administers a scheme under which export of engineering goods (capital goods and consumer durables) is allowed under deferred credit arrangements, permitting realization of export value in installments over a period exceeding six months. Some exports are prohibited,9 and others, including coffee, groundnuts, nonmanufactured tobacco, raw cot- ton, raw wool, and oil cakes are subject to export duties. Some others, including footwear, roasted and salted peanuts, man-made fibers, live sheep and goats, are subject to minimum prices. A substantial number of exports, mainly new manufactures, such as engineering goods, receive cash compensatory support, import duty drawbacks, refund of central excise du ty, and exemp- tions. The Import Replenishment Scheme provides for imports of specified products against exports of certain products. Bona fide foreign tourists can, with the 8The export of certain commodities, inc lud ing sugar, raw ju te, and several categories of steel, is reserved for the state-trading enterprises. 9Exports that are prohibited include rock crystal, quartz, silk waste, some varieties of plants and derivatives, all varieties of forestry, foundation and breeder seeds, tallow fat and/or oil of any animal origin, rough (uncut and unset) precious stones, sugarcane, Khandsari sugar, palmyra sugar candy, and jaggery. 262 approval of the customs, take out of India articles purchased with foreign exchange or with rupees acquired against foreign exchange, without a value limit; silver- ware of up to Rs 200 a person may also be exported on the same basis, subject to a limit of Rs 400 a family. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles must be surrendered. There are schemes for the priority allotment of cars, scooters, and tractors against certain inward remittances of foreign exchange. The import of Indian currency notes and coin is, in general, prohibited. However, deck-class passen- gers from Burma, Malaysia, Singapore, Gulf ports, and East Africa, and travelers from Pakistan and Sri Lanka, may import into India Rs 20 a person against presenta- tion of evidence that they previously had exported this amount from India. Travelers from Burma, other than deck-class passengers, may bring in Indian currency notes up to Rs 50 an adult and Rs 25 a child between the ages of 12 and 18 years. Travelers from Nepal may bring in up to Rs 75 a person. Foreign currency notes may be brought into India without limit, provided that the total amount brought in is declared to the customs authorities upon arrival if the value of foreign notes, coin, and traveler's checks exceeds US$1,000 or its equivalent. Foreign currency notes may be sold to any authorized dealer in foreign exchange or to any authorized money changer. Capital There are no restrictions on receipt of inward remit- tances from any country through authorized dealers in India; subsequent utilization of such funds in India is, however, subject to approval in most cases. Foreign investments, once admitted, are eligible for the same treatment that Indian enterprises receive. Banks in India may borrow freely from their branches and correspondents abroad, provided that borrowings in excess of Rs 2 million are utilized for the purchase of rupees from the Reserve Bank or in the interbank market to finance their normal business operations in India; repayment of such borrowings requires the prior ap- proval of the Reserve Bank and may be effected only when the debtor bank has no outstanding borrowings in India from the Reserve Bank or any other bank. Foreign borrowing by nonbank Indian companies is subject to Reserve Bank approval; permission is granted on the basis of merits for any loan which has not been obtained as an official or officially guaranteed credit by the Central Government. Reserve Bank permission is required for initiating, expanding, or continuing in India any business activity or holding or acquiring shares of any company carrying on a trading, commercial, or industrial activity in India, by nonresidents, noncitizens, nonbank companies not incorporated under Indian law, and Indian companies ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution with over 40 percent nonresident interest.10 Foreign investment is governed by the Foreign Exchange Regula- tion Act (FERA) of 1973. The Reserve Bank will allow companies having nonresident interest in excess of 40 percent and up to 74 percent to continue their activities depending on the extent to which the company is engaged in "core" industry or export-oriented produc- tion, or in manufacturing activities that require sophis- ticated technology. Foreign companies can retain a 51 percent nonresident equity as long as their combined core sector production involving application of sophis- ticated technology, and export production account for not less than 60 percent of their annual turnover, with a minimum of 10 percent of exports out of their total annual turnover w i th in a period not exceeding two years from the date of approval by the Reserve Bank. If their combined core sector production, application of sophis- ticated technology, and export production account for not less than 75 percent of their annual turnover, foreign companies can retain 74 percent nonresident ownership. Companies with exports exceeding 40 percent of the total ex-factory cost of annual production are allowed to operate with 51 percent nonresident equity, and those with export performance exceeding 60 percent of total ex-factory cost of annual production are eligible to retain foreign equity up to 74 percent. Companies that export 100 percent of production may be wholly owned by nonresidents.

Nonresident Indians and overseas companies defined above can use funds derived from fresh remittances or held in their Nonresident (External) Accounts or Foreign Currency (Nonresident) Accounts to (a) make portfolio investments, with repatriation benefit, up to 1 percent of the capital, provided that their holdings of shares and convertible debentures held on either a repatriable or nonrepatriable basis do not exceed (i) 5 percent of the paid-up capital of the company concerned, or (ii) 5 percent of the total paid-up value of each series of debentures issued by the company concerned; (b) invest freely in National Savings Certificates w i th fu ll repatriation benefit; and (c) invest up to 40 percent of the new equity capital issued by a company (other than a FERA company) setting up industrial manufac- turing projects, and up to 74 percent of new investments, including expansion of existing industrial undertakings in specified priority industries, with free repatriation of such investment and income therefrom after deduction of applicable Indian taxes.

INDIA foreign shareholding to 40 percent w i th in a specified period, or change their activities to meet the above criteria. Branches of foreign companies other than airlines, shipping companies, and liaison offices must in all cases become Indian companies. All companies are subject to "dilution" formulas, as follows: companies w i th foreign direct holdings exceed- ing 75 percent must raise 40 percent of the estimated cost of expansion through additional equity capital issued to Indians; for companies with foreign holdings above 60 percent but below 75 percent, and above 51 percent but below 60 percent, the corresponding equ i ty is permitted in companies engaged predominantly in inter- nal trading and commercial activities. Without the permission of the Reserve Bank, residents are prohibited from lending to, or depositing money w i th, a nonbank firm or company in which the nonresident interest is more than 40 percent. Noncitizens, non-Indian compa- nies, and nonbank Indian firms w i th more than 40 per- cent foreign participation must obtain Reserve Bank permission in order to acquire, hold, transfer, or dispose of immovable property within India (except when a lease for a period of not more than five years is involved). The prior approval of the Reserve Bank is also required for all transfers of shares of Indian companies by nonresi- dents or foreign nationals to other persons, whether resident or nonresident. However, sale and transfer of shares of Indian companies through stock exchanges in India by nonresidents of Indian nationality or origin in favor of citizens of India or persons of Indian origin do not require the Reserve Bank's clearance, where the proceeds of such shares sold by the transferor are credited to his ordinary nonresident rupee account, with a bank authorized to deal in foreign exchange in India, without a right of repatriation outside India. Residents are prohibited, except w i th Reserve Bank permission, from engaging in any transaction which increases beyond 49 percent the nonresident share of a business outside India in which the nonresident interest is 49 percent or less, and they are also prohibited, except with Reserve Bank permission, from holding, acquiring, transferring, or disposing of immovable property outside India (except where a lease of not more than five years is involved). Residents also require Reserve Bank approval to transfer any interest in a business in India to a nonresident, a noncitizen, a nonbank company not incorporated under Indian law, or an Indian company with over 40 percent foreign participation. Furthermore, Reserve Bank approval is required for residents export- ing Indian securities and transferring Indian securities to nonresidents. Residents are prohibited —except with central government or Reserve Bank permission —from guaranteeing the obligation of a nonresident or the obligation of a resident in favor of a nonresident, and are also prohibited, except w i th central government permis- sion, from associating with or participating in any business concern outside India.

Not for Redistribution INDIA appreciation on the original investment, may be repatri- ated at any time. However, Reserve Bank approval must be obtained before effecting a sale which involves repatriation of assets. The proceeds of approved sales are allowed to be remitted in suitable annual installments, not exceeding four. The proceeds from liquidated foreign investments not eligible for repatriation are kept in a nonresident account. Indian nationals are not normally granted any foreign exchange facilities for emigration purposes. In cases of exceptional hardship, foreign exchange may be released up to the equivalent of Rs 100,000 in one lump sum at the time of emigration; the remainder of the emigrant's assets and income is kept in a nonresident account and no further remittances, including pensions, if any, are allowed. Foreign nationals who are temporarily resident in India (other than nationals of the People's Republic of China, Pakistan, and South Africa) are permitted at the time of their retirement to transfer to their own countries the proceeds from the sale of their investments, subject to a limit of Rs 100,000 for each family at the time of retirement and the remainder in annual installments not exceeding Rs 50,000; in addition, they may transfer all their current remittable assets in India. There are no restrictions on the import into India of Indian or foreign securities. The acquisition, sale, transfer, export, or other disposal of foreign securities requires approval. Residents (other than foreign nation- als temporarily but not permanently resident in India and their foreign-born wives also not permanently resident in India) who are private persons are not normally per- mitted to purchase securities or personal real estate outside India. Indian nationals, and persons of Indian origin holding foreign passports, resident abroad and wishing to return to India to take up employment or to set up small industrial units are upon application exempted, for a period of five years from the date of their return to India, from the requirement that any foreign currency balances in their possession be surrendered within three months of arrival. As an alternative to holding such balances in the form of foreign currency, the holders may use the funds for the import of machinery, raw materials, and compo- nents, subject to an import license, or, in small amounts, for personal requirements. Furthermore, they have the option of surrendering their balances immediately, with the right to reacquire them within five years should they decide to return to a foreign country. Balances held in Nonresident (External) Accounts or Foreign Currency (Nonresident) Accounts in India by such persons on the date of their return to India are also eligible for similar retransfer or reconversion facilities. These various facilities are not available in respect of earnings arising from employment abroad with any Indian-owned organ- ization. Foreign nationals in India not permanently residing there are permitted to maintain foreign currency accounts; this permission is also extended to foreign nationals of Indian origin who have come to India for 264 employment of a specified duration or for an assignment not exceeding three years. Under the Returning Indians Foreign Exchange Enti- tlement Scheme, persons of Indian nationality or origin returning to India for permanent residence on or after November 1, 1977 are entitled to avail themselves of foreign exchange to the extent of 25 percent of the amount they brought in on transfer of residence, plus the balance held in their Nonresident (External) Accounts and Foreign Currency (Nonresident) Accounts for cer- tain specified purposes for which exchange is normally not freely available. Persons eligible under the scheme may make use of the exchange facility within a period of ten years from the date of return of the head of the family. Gold Detailed control is exercised over the acquisition, possession, manufacture, and disposal of gold through the Administration of Gold (Control) Act. There is a ban on private possession of primary gold. Although there is no ban on possession of finished articles of gold (including coin) previously declared, there is restriction on their manufacture and acquisition. There is no restriction on the acquisition, disposal, or possession of gold ornaments, except that holdings of such ornaments (which may be of any purity) above specified limits must be declared. The consumption of gold by industrial users is regulated through permits and authorizations. Control is exercised over dealers and goldsmiths through a system of licensing. Gold refining is under state manage- ment. The Government Mint is licensed to accept tenders of gold for purposes of refining and conversion into standard gold bars. Forward trading in gold or silver is prohibited; exports of silver bullion, sheets, and plates are banned, and exports of products of silver are subject to quota restrictions. With the exception of jewelry constituting the per- sonal effects of a traveler, imports of gold in any form by residents other than the monetary authorities require special authorization from the Reserve Bank and are not normally permitted; in certain cases, however, jewelers are permitted to manufacture gold jewelry in bond from imported gold, for export purposes only. Under the Gold Jewelry Export Promotion Replenish- ment Scheme exporters of ornaments and articles made of gold of not less than 0.5833 fineness are entitled to the replenishment by gold (imported by the State Bank of India and supplied at prices notified by the Government) against Release Orders issued by the licensing authori- ties, provided that they satisfy "value added" and other requirements of the scheme. Special permission for imports of gold and silver is granted only in exceptional cases where either no foreign exchange transaction is involved or the metals are needed for a particular purpose. Special permission is also granted when the gold or silver is imported for processing and re-export, provided that payment for the import will not be required, that the entire quantity of metal imported will ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution be re-exported in the form of jewelry, and that the value added will be repatriated to India in foreign exchange through an authorized dealer. Exports of gold in any form other than jewelry produced in India for export with a gold value not exceeding 10 percent of total value, and jewelry con- stituting the personal effects of a traveler, subject to certain monetary limits, are prohibited, unless the export is made by or on behalf of the monetary authorities. Under the gold jewelry export scheme, net export of gold from India is not permitted, and the export of gold jewelry is permitted only if the value added is 15 percent or more; export under the scheme to the Bilateral Group of countries is not permitted.

For exports of engineering goods on deferred payment terms, turnkey contracts, and civil construction INDIA contracts, it was announced that, with effect from November 1, 1984: (a) the limit up to which authorized dealers could grant pre-bid clearance would be increased from Rs 10 million to Rs 20 million, subject to prescribed terms; (b) the Export-Import Bank was given the delegated authority to clear proposals for project exports up to Rs 50 million, subject to standard terms and conditions prescribed by the RBI; (c) clearances required by contractors from the RBI, the Export Credit and Guarantee Corporation, and contractors' own bank- ers could be obtained jointly after a contract bid had been accepted; and (d) export of managerial, technical, or consultancy services for the installation of heavy equip- ment or machinery plants was made subject to prior approval by the interinstitutional working group. September 12. A ban was imposed on exports of rough (uncut and unset) precious stones and rock crystal quartz, but export of precious stones other than rock crystal quartz was allowed on an unrestricted basis. October 5. A ban was imposed on export of sugar- cane, Khandsari sugar, palmyra sugar candy, and jag- gery (Gur). Gold June 13. A gold jewelry export promotion replenish- ment scheme was introduced with effect from April 25, 1984, under which exporters of ornaments and articles made of gold of not less than 0.5833 fineness (equivalent to 14 carats) were entitled to replenishment by gold (imported by the State Bank of India, and supplied at prices notified by the Government against release orders issued by licensing authorities), provided they satisfied "value added" and other requirements of the scheme. 269 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INDONESIA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Indonesia is the Indonesian Rupiah. Effective March 30, 1983 the middle rate of the rupiah was depreciated by 27.6 percent in terms of the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency. At the same time, Bank Indonesia announced that it would continue to follow a policy of a managed float, taking into account a somewhat broader set of currencies than was previously the case. Transactions in the Jakarta Foreign Exchange Bourse are effected at rates within 1 percent either side of the middle rate of the rupiah; on December 31, 1984 the buying and selling rates for telegraphic transfers in the Bourse were Rp 1,072.50 and Rp 1,076.00, respec- tively, per US$1. Exchange rates for certain other currenciesl are determined on the basis of the rates in the Jakarta Bourse for the U .S. dollar and rates for the currencies concerned in international markets. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. In the Bourse, daily calls for exchange are conducted under the management of Bank Indonesia. Bidding for exchange is restricted to the authorized foreign exchange banks, nonbank financial institutions, and licensed foreign exchange dealers. Bank Indonesia stands willing to trade unlimited amounts of foreign exchange or rupiah with authorized traders at its intervention rates for the day. Bank Indonesia also offers authorized banks and nonbank financial institutions certain facilities for swap transactions in U.S. dollars. Administration of Control The implementation of exchange and trade control is entrusted to Bank Indonesia, the Ministry of Trade, the Ministry of Finance, foreign exchange banks, and the customs authorities. Exchange control is administered by Bank Indonesia and the Ministry of Finance. Sabang is entirely outside the Indonesian exchange and trade control system,2 but the Indonesian rupiah is legal tender there. Prescription of Currency Payments and receipts must be effected through the authorized banks and are normally effected in convert- ible currencies. Indonesia maintains no operative bilat- eral payments agreements.3 1 Currencies commonly used in Indonesia's international transac- tions, that is, Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Hong Kong dollars, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Malaysian ringgit, Nether- lands guilders, New Zealand dollars, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Singapore dollars, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. 2W i th the exception that the prohibition on imports of certain automobiles is applicable also in Sabang. 3 Indonesia maintains an inoperative bilateral payments agreement w i th the People's Republic of China. 270 Nonresident Accounts There are no restrictions on the opening by foreign nationals of accounts in Indonesia in rupiah or foreign currencies with authorized foreign exchange banks. For exchange control purposes, no distinction is made between resident and nonresident accounts. However, if the account holder wishes to withdraw funds, a letter must be sent to the bank; no checks may be drawn on foreign currency accounts. Imports and Import Payments There is a registry of authorized importers, and an initial deposit is required for registration. Since Octo- ber 31, 1968 only Indonesian nationals can be authorized as importers, although foreign investors are permitted to import the items required for their own projects. Imports from Angola, Israel, and South Africa are prohibited, as are imports from all sources of most secondhand goods and of specified commodities. Im- ports of many goods have long been restricted to approved importers, which are often state enterprises. Imports of chemical industry products, heavy equipment and spare parts, machines, machine equipment and spare parts, electric and electric industrial products, and metal industrial products must be effected by registered im- porters approved by the Minister of Trade. Importation of automotive spare parts and textiles is subject to the same registration and approval requirements. Importers of products within a given product group must have a license from the Ministry of Trade within that group. No restrictions are placed on the number of licensed import- ers in each category. Certain categories of agricultural imports, including 46 different categories of food, beverages, and fruits can be imported only by registered importers designated by the Minister of Trade. Beginning from March 1983, the procurement policies of companies approved for the importation of fru i t, alcoholic beverages, chickens, and eggs are evaluated annually by the Government, al- though explicit quantitative restrictions are not placed on these products. Imports of steel products in the form of steel slabs, steel sheets for vessels, hot-rolled steel sheet in coils, and other specified hot-rolled sheets are controlled by the Government and can be made only by Persero Niaga (a state-trading company), acting on behalf of PT Krakatau Steel, a government-owned steel mill. Importation of a number of products is handled by state monopolies as follows: finished products made of iron or steel may only be imported by PT Dharma Niaga and PT Kerta Niaga; imports of off-the-road tires may only be executed by PT Dharma Niaga and PT Pantja Niaga; imports of brake fluids and lubricating fat are made solely by PT Pantja Niaga and PT Tjipta Niaga; and HVS-type paper and ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution manifold, onionskin, seed, corona, reinforced and draw- ing paper, and HVO litho may be imported only by PT Pantja Niaga. Import duties, which are partly specific and partly ad valorem, are imposed on the basis of "check" prices (indicative prices) determined by the Minister of Trade. These prices reflect c . i . f. prices and are changed when prices abroad differ by more than 10 percent from the check prices for the preceding three months. Sales taxes of 5, 10, and 20 percent are levied on most imports on their c . i . f. value plus import du ty. Certain commodities are granted preferential duty treatment within the framework of the ASEAN preferential trading ar- rangements. Items that are exempt from import duties are also exempt from sales taxes. The MPO tax, a special withholding tax levied on imports (as well as exports) since 1967, was abolished as part of a tax reform effected in January 1984. Public sector imports must be effected in vessels operated by Indonesian companies. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Angola, Israel, and South Africa are prohibited, as are exports to all countries of gold ore, pure gold, silver ore, and pure silver; rawhides of cattle; certain categories of unprocessed or low-quality rubber; certain logs and timber; all types of waste paper (from Java and Madura); scrap of bronze and copper (except from Irian Jaya); iron scrap; steel scrap; fertilizers; rice; sugar; kapok seeds; antiques of cultural value; and raw rattan. Registration of authorized exporters is required. Ex- ports of certain domestically produced commodities are controlled by means of quotas, or requirement of prior authorization with the Ministry of Trade in order to maintain supplies to meet domestic demand, and to encourage domestic processing of certain raw mate- rials.4 Concern with domestic price stability sometimes involves suspension of exports of various items on this list. The prior authorization of the Minister of Trade is required for the export of flatbark crepe, cinchona bark, clove seeds, pepper seeds, silver exported by PN Aneka Tambang, and all goods produced from subsidized raw materials. Exports of plywood, veneer, and blockboard may be effected only by registered exporters of plywood recognized by the Ministry of Trade. All other com- modities may be freely exported by registered private firms and state-trading firms. There are no restrictions on the type of financial arrangement exporters may use. There is no surrender requirement for export proceeds. To calculate export taxes on the principal commodities other than petroleum and gas, the sale prices must not be lower than the "indicative" prices determined periodically by the Minis- 4These include logs, fertilizer, cement, construction reinforcements of iron, automobile tires, paper, asphalt, stearin, cattle, salt, wheat flour, sugar, maize, soybeans, rice, copra, coconut oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, olein, and meat. INDONESIA ter of Trade. Exports of certain products are subject to an export tax: exports of arabica and robusta coffees are subject to taxes of 1.67 percent and 3.85 percent, respectively; copra cake, sawn timber, palm oil, and a few other commodities are subject to a 5 percent tax; the major mineral products (excluding bauxite ore and concentrates) to a 10 percent tax; and semiprocessed rattan, unsawn timber (logs), and certain types of hides to a 20 percent tax. A few products are also subject to an additional export tax, including palm oil (10.0 percent), crude stearin (18.48 percent), bleached refined deodorized stearin (13.8 percent), sonokeling wood (8.1 percent), ramin wood (0.75 percent), ebony (20.84 percent), and miscellaneous woods (6.75 per- cent). Since May 4, 1984, and following abolition of the MPO tax on exports, export tax collections have been channeled exclusively through the customs authorities (i.e., paid directly to the Treasury) rather than through foreign exchange banks (when effected on a letter of credit basis or with documents against payment or acceptance) as had previously been the case. Under the Export Certificate Scheme, exporters of specified products are eligible for a rebate of customs duties and import sales taxes paid on imported inputs. To qua l ify, an exporter must submit an application to the Ministry of Finance, providing such information as the sources of imported raw materials, their c . i . f. values, import duties and other taxes paid on imported raw materials, and the f .o.b. price of finished products being exported. The objective of the scheme is to reimburse the exporter for all indirect taxes he has paid on imported inputs. The rate of tax rebate is expressed as a percentage of the f .o.b. value of exports. Once the rate of tax rebate is determined for a specific product, it is applied to all exporters of the same product without further proof of the use of imported inputs until a new rate is determined. At present, some 544 items are eligible for the Export Certificate Scheme. These consist exclusively of manu- factured goods, and the rates of certificates range from 1.5 percent to 20 percent. Export certificates may be used by the exporter to pay other taxes or be cashed at the Treasury. Certain commodities produced in border regions may be exported to Malaysia and the Philippines in exchange for certain eligible goods. In this "border-crossing" trade with Malaysia, the value of import or export transactions must not exceed M$600 a month, whether transported overland or by sea; for the Philippines, the value of imports or exports must not exceed the rupiah or peso equivalent of US$150 for a single trip if transported by seagoing vessel or US$1,500 if transported by boat. Beginning from January 1982, the Indonesian Gov- ernment may, at its option, require all foreign firms (including domestic firms in which foreigners hold equity) bidding for government-sponsored construction or procurement projects to agree to fu l f i ll a counter- 271 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INDONESIA purchase obligation.5 Bidders for projects which include counterpurchase requirements must submit with their bids a letter agreeing to purchase and export the equivalent of the contract's value in selected Indonesian products (f.o.b.) during the life of the contract.6 Goods eligible to be used in fulfilling the counter- purchase requirement include agricultural products, manufactured and other products, excluding petroleum, natural gas, and items subject to export quotas. Lists of eligible products are issued periodically by the Depart- ment of Trade. The list of acceptable items has been expanded to include exports of labor services. The foreign supplier may fulfill its counterpurchase requirement either directly or through a third party, possibly from another country which is acceptable to the Indonesian Government. Such an arrangement must meet the condition of "additionally"; i.e., the counter- purchases by the third party have to be in addition to regular imports from Indonesia. The transference of counterpurchase obligations may be managed by a bank, but the primary responsibility for fulfillment of the requisite countertrade rests with the contractor. When a firm acts to fulfill a counterpurchase obliga- tion, it must meet one of two requirements: (a) if it has not previously exported Indonesian products, its exports of acceptable products must fulfill the counterpurchase obligation not later than three months prior to the termination period of the contract; and (b) if the firm has exported Indonesian goods during the preceding year, qualified exports during the current year must exceed those of the previous year by at least the value of the counterpurchase obligation. Failure to fulfill one's counterpurchase obligations may result in a penalty of up to 50 percent of the counterpurchase shortfall. Final payment to the foreign supplier will not be made until after the countertrade has been effected. Counterpurchase sanctions have yet to be imposed. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles These are not restricted or subject to control. Proceeds from invisibles need not be surrendered. Travelers may take out and bring in any amount in foreign bank notes but only Rp 50,000 in Indonesian notes and coin other than gold and silver commemorative coins (see section on Gold, below). Capital Foreign capital invested in Indonesia is governed primarily by the Foreign Capital Investment Law of January 10, 1967, and subsequently amended by a 5 Projects or parts thereof financed with concessional loans as well as with credits from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the Islamic Development Bank are exempted from such requirements, as is the procurement of sophisticated technology and professional services and procurements involving joint ventures between state enterprises and foreign investors. 6 Contract value for this purpose is defined as being net of what the contractor spends on Indonesian supplies, taxes, duties, and wages paid within the country. 272 number of Presidential Guidelines and Decrees. In principle, such investments may be undertaken only through a joint venture with an Indonesian partner. All investments in Indonesia require the approval of the President on the recommendation of the Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM). Enterprises that are wholly or largely operated in Indonesia as separate business units must be incorporated under Indonesian law and must have their domicile in Indonesia. The operating permit for foreign investment is usually valid for a maximum of 30 years. With the introduction of the new income tax law on January 1, 1984, existing investment incentives for foreign capital investment in the form of tax holidays, investment allowances, loss compensations, and exemp- tions from dividend taxes have been formally abolished. The incentives currently applied for foreign investments are: exemption from the capital stamp duty and from import duties on capital goods, raw materials, auxiliary goods, and spare parts; an annual depreciation allowance of 25 percent for fiscal purposes on virtually all machinery and other productive capital goods; and deferral of certain taxes on imports of capital goods. Investors are granted the right to make capital repatria- tion, to transfer profits (after settlement of taxes and financial obligations in Indonesia) and to make transfers relating to expenses connected with the employment of foreign nationals in Indonesia, and in respect of depreci- ation allowances. The exploration and development of petroleum resources are governed by the Petroleum Law of 1960. There are no limitations on the remittance to Indonesia of capital in the form of foreign exchange or com- modities. Both residents and nonresidents may hold foreign currency deposits with foreign exchange banks. However, foreign exchange banks and nonbank financial institutions are subject to Bank Indonesia directives with respect to borrowing abroad, the acceptance of deposits from nonresidents, and the issuance of certificates of deposit to nonresidents. A 15 percent reserve require- ment is applicable to the foreign currency liabilities of foreign exchange banks; no reserve requirements are applicable to the foreign borrowings of nonbank finan- cial institutions or private companies. Certain borrowing abroad is subject to clearance by Bank Indonesia, and all foreign borrowing is subject to reporting to Bank Indonesia or the Ministry of Finance, or both. The prior approval of the Minister of Finance is required before any public enterprise or public sector body may accept a loan from abroad. Indonesian citizens and residents of foreign nationality may freely transfer, negotiate, import, and export securi- ties denominated in rupiah or in foreign currency. Gold Indonesia has issued two commemorative gold coins, which are legal tender. Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold and gold coins in Indonesia. Exports of gold ore and pure gold, unless made by or on behalf of ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution the monetary authorities, are prohibited. Travelers may freely take out up to Rp 65,000 a person in Indonesian commemorative gold and silver coins issued in August 1970 and up to Rp 130,000 a person in gold and silver coins issued in October 1974; amounts in excess of these limits require the prior approval of Bank Indonesia. Gold may be imported free of license only by importers designated by the Government. Such imports require prior notification to the Ministry of Industry and are subject to an additional levy of Rp 25 per US$1. Changes During 1984 Imports and Import Payments January 1.

Not for Redistribution ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Islamic Republic of Iran is the Iranian Rial, which is pegged to the SDR at Rls 92.300 = SDR 1. Exchange rates for individual currencies are determined on a daily basis in light of the SDR-rial rate and the SDR rate for such currencies as declared by the Fund. On December 31, 1984 the official rates of Bank Markazi Jomhouri Islami Iran (the central bank) for the U.S. dollar were Rls 93.768 buying and Rls 94.218 selling, respectively, per US$1. These daily exchange rates are used for all transactions, with the exception of a preferential rate applied to proceeds from non-oil exports. Administration of Control Exchange control authority is vested in Bank Markazi. All foreign exchange transactions must take place through this Bank or authorized banks. Imports and exports are governed by regulations issued periodically by the Ministry of Commerce after approval by the Council of Ministers. Prescription of Currency Transactions with countries1 having clearing agree- ments with the Islamic Republic of Iran are conducted through the terms of those agreements. The unit of account of these agreements is usually the U.S. dollar, the exception being the account with the People's Republic of China which is denominated in the Iranian rial. Settlements with member countries of the Asian Clearing Union (Bangladesh, Burma, India, Nepal, Pakistan,2 and Sri Lanka) in respect of current transac- tions (other than those relating to petroleum and natural gas and their products) are required to be effected in Asian Monetary Units (AMUs). Final settlement, when necessary, takes place by converting AMUs to an agreed currency. Payments to and from Pakistan and Turkey relating to the exchange of goods and related services (excluding border trade and petroleum and petroleum products) are settled through clearing accounts main- tained by the respective central banks in U.S. dollars. Settlements in respect of petroleum and petroleum products and certain services are made through special accounts held by the central banks of these three countries. Banking arrangements have been concluded with major Western European banks to establish "Spe- cial Accounts" for clearing payments related to the sale of crude oil in exchange for purchase of a variety of Bulgaria, People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Poland, Romania, and U.S.S.R. 2Pakistan, being a member of a separate agreement with the Islamic Republic of Iran, settles its payments through that agreement instead of in the AMU. 274 products and raw materials. There are three other special arrangements between the Islasmic Republic of Iran and the German Democratic Republic, the Syrian Arab Republic, and Yugoslavia, making use of the Special Accounts system of payment. Nonresident Accounts Foreign nationals may maintain rial accounts, as well as accounts in foreign currencies, with authorized banks. The balance of the rial accounts may only be used in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Imports and Import Payments All imports into the Islamic Republic of Iran are required to be authorized by the ministries and organiza- tions concerned, before being registered by authorized banks. Imports from Israel and South Africa are pro- hibited. Some imports are made by government-operated import agencies (procurement and distribution centers); individual importers can also initiate the importation of goods, subject to the prior approval of the procurement and distribution centers. The import policy is re- examined periodically; at the end of each Iranian calendar year (commencing March 21), new export- import regulations, effective for the next year, are published by the Ministry of Commerce. The regulations distinguish between "authorized," "unauthorized," and "prohibited" goods. "Authorized" goods are those goods whose imports and exports, with due consideration for the regulations, are permitted. "Unauthorized" goods are goods whose exports or imports are temporarily pro- hibited by the Government or are contingent on fulfilling certain requirements (as explained in the relative tariff). "Prohibited" goods applies to those goods whose trans- actions are forbidden by Islamic Sharia or by the law. At the time of registration of imports, a registration fee of 2 percent of the value of the order, calculated on an f .o .b. basis, is collected by authorized banks. At the time of registration of some goods, importers must deposit with Bank Markazi, through an authorized bank, 15 percent of the c . i . f. value of the goods. Most food items and certain other commodities are exempt from the registration deposit. The registration deposit is refund- able upon presentation of the customs clearance certifi- cate after the goods have been cleared through customs, or if the order is canceled. If less than 90 percent of the registration value is used, the amount of refund of registration fee will be in proportion to the unused amount of the registration order. Bank Markazi may permit, when necessary, the shifting of imports from the category in which registration deposit is required to the exempt category, and vice versa. Most imports are subject to commercial benefit taxes, which are either specific or ad valorem and are imposed in addition to any applicable customs du ty. Monopoly taxes, if any, are ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution included in the commercial benefit taxes. The authorities specify in the export-import regulations the commercial benefit taxes for each year. These taxes are paid to the customs before customs clearance. The clearance through customs is authorized upon the presentation of shipping documents endorsed by an authorized bank and the permission of the relative procurement and distribu- tion center. Payments for Invisibles The transfer of premiums for reinsurance is permitted at the daily rate upon the request of the insurance company. Foreign nationals working in the Islamic Republic of Iran whose employment has been recognized as necessary by the Government may remit between 45 percent and 65 percent of their net salaries, depending on their specialty. The basic travel allowance for an individual Iranian over 15 years old is up to the equivalent of US$500, upon presentation of a valid passport, valid exit visa, travel ticket, and evidence of payment of the travel tax. An extra allowance can be provided to the spouse up to the equivalent of US$500 and for two children of the passport holder up to the equivalent of US$200. Persons needing medical treatment abroad may obtain foreign exchange up to the equivalent of US$10,000, contingent upon the approval of the High Medical Council of the Ministry of Health; additional foreign exchange can be obtained from Bank Markazi upon the presentation of validated bills for medical expenditures. The sale of foreign exchange to students studying abroad varies according to cost of living in the respective country, up to a maximum of US$750 a month; an additional allowance of 45 percent and 15 percent of the basic allowance is provided for the spouse and for each child. In certain cases where this allowance does not cover tuition, university fees and expenses are separately calculated and paid. Travelers leaving the Islamic Re- public of Iran may take with them up to Rls 20,000 in Iranian bank notes. Travelers of foreign nationality may not export more foreign currency than they imported. Import and export of any amount of foreign currency is allowed, provided that such amount was declared at the time of arrival, less any amount sold to authorized banks. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of all commodities are subject to prevailing regulations on foreign trade. The commercial benefit tax and customs duty charged at the time of import of raw materials used in manufactured goods for export are refunded to the exporter after the export has taken place. Bank Markazi offers a preferential rate of exchange for exporters who fu lf i ll their obligations prior to expiry of their export contracts. Exporters of non-oil goods may import authorized goods up to the value of goods exported. Such exporters may transfer the declared foreign exchange earnings to ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN another individual for import of goods. Depending on different categories of goods, rial incentives are offered to encourage exports. The foreign currency proceeds from commodity ex- ports are sold to banks authorized to deal in foreign exchange. Authorized banks accept export proceeds normally in currencies quoted by Bank Markazi. With the prior approval of Bank Markazi, other currencies may also be accepted. Exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. With the approval of Bank Markazi, exporters may import certain goods up to a value equivalent to their exports. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from export of invisibles, if earned abroad, may be retained in a foreign currency account with an authorized bank. Transfers from such accounts do not require the prior approval of Bank Markazi. Travelers may bring into the country up to Rls 20,000 in Iranian bank notes. Capital Iranian nationals may retain their foreign exchange earnings, if earned abroad, in domestic foreign currency accounts with the authorized banks. Transfers abroad from such accounts do not require the approval of Bank Markazi. Foreign capital investment is supervised by the Organization for Investment and Economic and Techn- ical Assistance, in the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance. Repatriation of foreign capital is permitted with the approval of this organization and the Bank Markazi. The net short-term foreign liabilities of the commercial banks are subject to a reserve requirement of 27 percent. Gold No Iranian gold coins are legal tender. Residents may freely and without license purchase, hold, and sell gold and silver in the Islamic Republic of Iran. There is a free market for both metals. Authorized banks may import gold and silver bullion at the official rate of exchange with prior approval of Bank Markazi. The import and export of gold for monetary purposes or for international settlements is reserved for Bank Markazi, while imports for industrial and dental use are effected by professional organizations at the official rate and subject to supervi- sion by Bank Markazi; such imports are subject to customs duty, the commercial benefit levy, and an import registration fee. Passengers may, without prior approval of Bank Markazi, bring in jewelry with a value equivalent to Rls 5 million, which will be recorded in their passports so that the same may be exported; imports of personal jewelry with a value exceeding this amount require the approval of Bank Markazi. The export of Iranian gold coins for numismatic purposes requires prior approval by Bank Markazi. Changes During 1984 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 275 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution IRAQ (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Iraq is the Iraqi Dinar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at ID 1 = US$3.2169. The official buying and selling rates on December 31, 1984 were US$3.2249 and US$3.2089, respectively, per ID 1. Buying and selling rates for certain other currencies1 are also officially quoted, with daily quotations based on the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar in markets abroad. The Central Bank of Iraq undertakes transactions in the listed currencies only with authorized dealers. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Exchange control authority is vested in the Board of Administration of the Central Bank; this authority has been delegated to the Governor and his Deputy who act on recommendations submitted by an Advisory Commit- tee on Foreign Exchange. Certain approval authority has been delegated to the Department of Foreign Exchange of the Central Bank and to licensed dealers. Foreign exchange transactions must take place through a licensed dealer unless otherwise authorized by the Governor. All branches of the Rafidain Bank, the sole commercial bank, are licensed dealers. Import policy and the annual program are formulated by the Board for the Regulation of Trade and supervised by the Ministry of Trade. Prescription of Currency Settlements with foreign countries normally must be made in any of the listed currencies or by drawing on a nonresident account in Iraqi dinars, provided that the funds on the nonresident account were obtained origin- ally through credits in any one of the listed currencies. There are no bilateral payments arrangements. Payments to and receipts from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts The opening of a nonresident account requires the approval of the exchange control authorities. Nonresi- dent accounts are divided into ordinary nonresident accounts, which arise from transactions in respect of current payments, and special nonresident accounts, which arise from transactions in respect of capital transfers. Imports and Import Payments Imports of commodities normally are handled by the socialized sector. All private imports are subject to Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. 276 licenses, except imports of materials constituting basic elements for development projects benefiting from the Law for Major Development Projects, No. 157 of 1973. In principle, licenses are issued in accordance with an annual import program. Imports of all goods from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Imports of some commodities on a protection list are, in principle, prohibited from all sources. To finance the Export Subsidy Fund, a tax of 0.5 per- cent is levied on imports of capital goods and a tax of 0.75 percent is levied on imports of consumer goods. All imports subject to import duty are also subject to a customs surcharge of 15 percent of the applicable customs duty. The Rafidain Bank makes exchange available upon presentation of the exchange control copy of the import license, except in some instances where reference has to be made to the Central Bank. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require permission. Ex- change is usually granted for educational and medical expenses abroad, freight on exports effected on a c. & f. basis, insurance premiums, royalties, etc. Exchange is not granted to merchants for the insurance abroad of their imports or exports. The Rafidain Bank is permitted, subject to the approval of the Central Bank, to transfer up to 50 percent of annual income accrued to Arab and foreign nationals resident in Iraq, unless the particular contract extends this limit up to 75 percent for old contracts or 60 percent for new contracts. Certain nonresident private sector companies that have contracts with public institutions in Iraq are permitted to transfer the amounts provided for in those contracts; those not employed under contracts may transfer abroad a monthly amount of ID 58 a person, or 50 percent of salary for those working with the private sector on a noncontractual basis, whichever is less. The regulations provide, in principle for basic ex- change allowance for tourist travel abroad on the basis of classification of foreign countries into two categories (first) and (second) as follows: the basic allowance for travel to a country in the first category is ID 300 a trip for each person 18 years of age or over (ID 150 for persons under 18 years of age) for each trip to Arab and socialist countries, Turkey, Cyprus, and Greece. For the second category, which includes all other countries, the basic allowance is ID 500 a trip for each person 18 years of age or over (ID 250 for persons under 18 years of age). Individual exchange allowance for official missions abroad for first category countries ranges between ID 30-60 a person a day depending on status and duration of missions; for second category countries, the allowance ranges between ID 40-75 per day. Foreign ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution exchange allocations for Iraqi students abroad are ad- justed according to a certain formula: for example, for each academic year, US$9,240 is allowed for a student in the United States, £ stg. 3,930 for the United Kingdom, and the equivalent of US$5,378 for Tunisia. Travelers may take out ID 5 in Iraqi currency notes, which is considered part of the basic travel allowance, and the balance of that allowance in traveler's checks. Residents on pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia are permitted to transfer the equivalent of ID 100 for boarding accommo- dation, in addition to ID 250 allowance for personal expenses. Half of this allowance is permitted for persons under 18 years. Exchange allowances for pilgrimage are unrelated to other traveling allowances during the year. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Israel and South Africa and exports of certain goods to all other countries are prohibited. The Board for the Regulation of Trade has authority to prohibit the export of any commodity when supply falls short of domestic demand. The export of certain items is reserved for the General Organization for Exports. All other exports are licensed freely. Exporters generally must undertake to repatriate their foreign exchange proceeds through the Rafidain Bank and to surrender them within two months after shipment. Under an export subsidy fund established in 1969 for the purpose of assisting non-oil exports, financial sup- port is limited to 25 percent of the value of the eligible exports. The scheme was intended to introduce Iraqi goods abroad, whether from the private or socialist sector, and to improve their competitive position by providing temporary assistance while markets for the commodities were established. An export item is inelig- ible for the subsidy if its import content exceeds 40 per- cent. All applications for assistance are reviewed by a special committee headed by the Chairman of the Export Organization within the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The subsidy fund continues to be financed with taxes on imports, but there are currently no exports receiving subsidies under the scheme as all exports are considered to be viable without subsidy assistance. Surcharge levies by the Export Organization have been discontinued. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange receipts in excess of ID 50 from invisibles must be surrendered within three months to a licensed dealer. Travelers may bring in foreign ex- change, including currency notes (other than Israel currency), in unlimited amounts, provided that the funds are declared on an exchange control form; amounts not intended to be taken out of the country are exempt from declaration. Travelers may bring in ID 25 in Iraqi notes, and Arab nationals of Gulf countries may bring in ID 100 in such notes. IRAQ Capital Nonresidents may import capital freely, except from Israel or South Africa, but they must deposit it with the Rafidain Bank; such deposits may be converted into local currency at the official rate, and repatriation to the country of origin is permitted. Under Resolution No. 1646 of the Revolutionary Command Council, enacted in November 1980, no foreign (defined as non- Arab) participation is allowed in the capital of private sector companies, but citizens of Arab states may participate with Iraqis in the capital of industrial projects and commercial companies. All transfers of capital abroad by residents, whether Iraqis or foreigners, require exchange control approval. Special facilities allow Arab investors to bring in convertible currency; similar facilities permit Iraqi nationals abroad to open accounts at the Rafidain Bank with foreign currencies that are freely transferable abroad. Under the Industrial Investment Regulation Law for private and mixed sectors (No. 115 of 1982), certain incentives and guarantees are granted to approved investments of domestic or Arab capital in Iraq. In addition, Arab capital invested in Iraq is accorded preferential treatment in different economic sectors. Arab farmers having contracts with the Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform are permitted to transfer abroad annually up to 50 percent of their individual net return, subject to a limit of ID 500. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in Iraq in any form other than gold bars. Imports and exports of gold in any form require the approval of the Central Bank. Iraqi citizens may bring in with them gold for personal use up to 250 grams of worked gold free of tax. Imports of worked gold in excess of 250 grams are subject to a duty of 35 percent, and all gold transactions are required to be declared on a foreign exchange form at the point of entry. Iraqi residents may take out with them worked gold not exceeding 100 grams a person, subject to declaration; such gold should be brought back on return to the country. Nonresident Iraqis are allowed to take out with them worked gold which they have already brought with them for personal use when they entered Iraq. Foreigners can also bring into the country worked gold up to 250 grams a person. Export of gold for commercial purposes is not permitted. Changes During 1984 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 277 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution IRELAND (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Ireland is the Irish Pound. Ireland participates with Belgium, Denmark, France, the Fed- eral Republic of Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands in the exchange rate and intervention mech- anism of the European Monetary System (EMS). In accordance with this agreement, Ireland maintains the spot exchange rates between the Irish pound and the currencies of the other participants within margins of 2.25 percent (in the case of the Italian lira, 6 percent) above or below the cross rates based on the central rates expressed in European Currency Units (ECUs). The agreement implies that the Central Bank of Ireland stands ready to buy or sell the currencies of the other participating states in unlimited amounts at specified intervention rates. On December 31, 1984 these rates were as follows: Specified Intervention Rates Per: Irish Pounds Upper limit Lower limit 100 Belgian or Luxembourg francs 1.6530 100 Danish kroner 9.1168 100 deutsche mark 33.1015 100 French francs 10.7964 100 Italian lire 0.0549015 100 Netherlands guilders 29.3832 1.5803 8.7157 31.6455 10.3214 0.0486968 28.0904 The participants in the EMS do not maintain exchange rates for other currencies within fixed limits. On Decem- ber 31, 1984 the official midpoint closing rate for the U.S. dollar was US$0.9915 per Ir£l. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. On February 15, 1961, Ireland formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control Exchange control is operated by the Central Bank. Much of the authority for approving normal payments is delegated to commercial banks authorized for this purpose (authorized banks). Import licenses, where necessary, are issued by the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce, and Tourism if the goods are of an industrial nature or by the Department of Agriculture if they are agricultural in character; import licenses are also issued by the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and in some cases by the Department of Health or the Department of Justice. Import licensing is not used for exchange control purposes. Import and export controls are administered by the Revenue Commissioners. 278 Prescription of Currency The administration of Irish exchange control is based on the distinction between entities that are permanently resident in Ireland and nonresidents, that is, residents of other countries. The latter comprises two categories: (1) residents of EC member countries and (2) residents of all other countries. Authorized payments may be made in Irish pounds or in any foreign currency. The proceeds of exports must be received in foreign currency or in Irish pounds from an External Account. Nonresident Accounts Accounts in Irish pounds of nonresidents are desig- nated External Accounts. All credits in excess of Ir£250,000 to External Accounts held by nonbanks with authorized banks require specific approval by the Central Bank (or Ir£50,000 when such accounts are held with financial institutions other than authorized banks), ex- cept where the credit is in respect of imports into Ireland. There are also limits on maximum balances in External Accounts of nonresident banks; these may be maintained without prior approval of the Central Bank. External Accounts may be credited with payments that are eligible for transfer abroad under a general or specific exchange control approval, with transfers from other External Accounts, payments for any foreign currencies pur- chased from account holders, the proceeds of Irish currency notes received from abroad in denominations not exceeding Ir£20, payments from within the country up to Ir£100 in value, and interest payable on the accounts; they may be debited for transfers to residents, transfers to other External Accounts, the cost of any foreign currency sold to account holders, the transfer of any part of account balances to account holders, and bank charges, if applicable. Authorized banks may operate foreign currency ac- counts in the names of nonresidents in any foreign currency; these accounts are subject to the same require- ments as External Accounts. Authorized banks may also operate foreign currency accounts in the names of residents under specific central bank approval. Imports and Import Payments The import of certain goods into Ireland is subject to five types of administrative control, as follows: Quantitative Restriction. Special quota restrictions apply to (1) bicycle tires from countries other than member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and Japan; (2) certain textile products originating in the state-trading countries; (3) automobile tires from the German Democratic Re- public; (4) footwear from Czechoslovakia and Taiwant tSee Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part Two, page 54. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution (5) certain sacks and bags other than those of wool, cotton, and man-made fibers (mainly jute bags originat- ing in Bangladesh, Hong Kong, Japan, Macao, Malay- sia, Pakistan, Taiwant, the state-trading countries, and Yugoslavia); (6) certain ceramic products originating in the People's Republic of China and Romania; and (7) certain copper tubes originating in Spain. Autono- mous import restrictions have been imposed by the EC on certain textiles originating in Taiwant and Turkey and on styrene, polyethylene, certain firearms, certain sports and gymnasium equipment and snow skis made in the U .S .A. Voluntary Restraint. The EC has negotiated bilateral restraint agreements with various supplying countries on trade in textiles under which import quotas are set each year for different products. Surveillance. Ireland operates a system of surveillance on certain imports of the following: live plants or floricultural products, iron and steel products, clothing and textiles, footwear, twine, cordage, motorcar types, copper tubes, and specified ceramic products. National Public Policy. For reasons of national pol- icy, imports of certain goods (e.g., specified drugs, explosives, and firearms and ammunition) are prohibited without special licenses. Prior Permission. Under this type of control, prior permission of the Central Bank is required before orders may be placed for goods if they are not to be used in Ireland, or are to be delivered more than nine months after the date of the order, or if payment is not being made in an approved manner. Goods not for use in Ireland must, in general, be paid for with borrowed foreign currency. Special import restrictions apply in regard to motor vehicles. * Imports from non-EC countries of products covered by the Common Agricultural Policy of the EC may be subject to various charges such as levies and monetary compensatory amounts under that policy and to duties under the common customs tariff. For permitted imports, permission to make payments to nonresidents is granted automatically. Authority to make payments is delegated to authorized dealers. Exchange control forms are required for import payments exceeding Ir£l0,000. Payments for Invisibles Payments to nonresidents require approval. Approval to make payments for most invisibles is delegated to the authorized banks; for other invisibles, it is given by the Central Bank. For tourist travel there is a basic allowance in foreign currency for residents of Ireland of Ir£500 a person for each trip, or when the trip exceeds two months, Ir£2,000. For business travel, up to Ir£3,000 at a rate of Ir£100 a day is allowed for each journey. Limits are also tSee Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part Two, page 54. 'On January 1, 1985, the special restrictions on imports of motor vehicles were discontinued. IRELAND established for allowances for education and other purposes. Applications for larger amounts are approved, provided that no unauthorized export of capital is involved. Not more than Ir£500 of an allowance of foreign currency may be issued in the form of currency notes. Residents may also take with them up to Ir£100 in Irish currency notes. Nonresidents may take with them any foreign currency notes that they brought into Ireland. Exports and Export Proceeds A system of export licensing is applied to a limited range of goods. Exporters of goods must obtain payment for the goods within six months of shipment, if their value exceeds Ir£100. When payment is received in foreign currencies, the exchange must be offered for sale to an authorized bank. Exchange control forms are required for exports exceeding Ir£l0,000 and must be produced to Irish customs at the point of exportation. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles must be repatriated without delay, and if foreign currencies are received they must be offered for sale to an authorized dealer or permission for their retention must be obtained. Any foreign currency held by a person after his return from a trip abroad may be retained for subsequent travel purposes for three months from the date he received the exchange. There are no limitations on the import of Irish or foreign bank notes, but prior central bank approval must be obtained to credit Irish bank notes in denomina- tions exceeding Ir£20 to External Accounts. Capital Exchange control approval is required for all transfers of capital to nonresidents. Authority to make certain payments has been delegated to authorized dealers; other payments require central bank approval. The normal allowance available to Irish residents on emigration is Ir£40,000 for each family. When the total value of an emigrant's assets exceed Ir£40,000, the transfer of the excess amount is restricted for a period of four years from the emigrant's redesignation as a nonresident, that is, from the date of departure from Ireland; however, during this four-year period, income on restricted assets may be transferred abroad. After the four-year period, the balance of restricted assets may be freely exported without limit. For Irish residents taking up permanent residence in an EC country, including those taking up employment, applications to transfer Irish assets to the new country of residence in excess of the normal allowances are considered. There are no restrictions on the inflow of capital, but inward direct investment requires exchange control approval. Purchases of unquoted Irish securities by nonresidents require exchange control approval, and the purchase of nonurban land by foreign nationals in some cases requires approval by the Land Commission. Incoming capital received in foreign currencies must be offered for sale to an authorized dealer. 279 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution IRELAND The Central Bank considers applications by Irish residents for permission to purchase property for per- sonal use in a member country of the EC with foreign currency purchased at the official rate of exchange. The acquisition of personal property outside the EC may be financed only by foreign currency loans, which are approved by the Central Bank on application, subject to a limit of Ir£20,000 a property and one property for each family unit. Borrowings may be repaid with official foreign exchange in equal annual installments over a period of not less than five years. The entire foreign currency proceeds from the sale of property outside Ireland purchased for personal use of a resident must be offered for sale to an authorized dealer. Transactions in foreign currency securities are con- trolled to ensure that, in general, capital is not trans- ferred outside Ireland. All such transactions must be routed through an approved agent (an Irish bank, stockbroker, or solicitor). Resident holdings of all foreign currency securities may be sold only to nonresi- dents. Where such securities are sold, the proceeds must either be reinvested in foreign securities or be offered for sale to an authorized dealer within three months. During that three-month period, in the absence of the specific approval of the Central Bank, the proceeds must be held under the control of an approved agent. Purchases of foreign currency securities, apart from switches referred to above, are prohibited. The Central Bank may, however, approve applications by authorized insurers and pension funds for the export of a limited amount of funds at the current rate of exchange for investment in foreign currency securities. Foreign currency borrowing by institutional investors and professional portfolio managers for portfolio investment abroad may also be approved in some cases. The Central Bank will grant permission for investment at the current rate of exchange in securities issued by the EC, the European Investment Bank, the European Coal and Steel Community, and the European Atomic Energy Community. Such permission is granted only on an undertaking by the intending buyer that the securities will not be resold for at least one year from the date of purchase authorization, a requirement that applies also to purchases made from the sale or maturity proceeds of existing holdings. In line with this requirement, all sales of existing holdings of EC securi- ties are subject to exchange control approval. Direct investment abroad requires prior approval and may normally be financed by borrowing foreign cur- rency; in certain cases the use of official exchange may be approved, depending on the merits of the project. Use of official exchange is allowed, however, for all ap- proved new direct investments by Irish residents in EC member countries. Purchases by nonresidents of Irish registered securities must be funded with foreign currency or Irish pounds from an External Account; purchases in excess of Ir£100,000 must be notified to the Central Bank. 280 Remittances of cash gifts or personal loans are normally permitted up to Ir£ 1,500 a donor a calendar year. Applications by Irish residents to make cash gifts to EC residents, in excess of the normal allowance, are considered. Residents require prior exchange control approval (1) to accept loans from nonresidents, irrespective of the currency of such loans, and (2) to accept loans in foreign currency from any source; such applications are consid- ered on their merits and, except as regards borrowing for the acquisition of property for personal use, on the benefit likely to accrue to the economy. Public sector borrowing from nonresidents is undertaken following consultation with the Central Bank. Lending of Irish currency to nonresidents is not normally permitted, except to the extent that overdraft facilities may be provided by the banks to members of diplomatic and consular missions in Ireland. Provided that the company is not a channel for portfolio investment, a subsidiary or branch of a company controlled directly by interests in EC countries may obtain from Irish banks, subject to exchange control approval, all the finance it requires for its operation in Ireland. Gold Residents may freely hold, buy, borrow, sell, or lend gold coin in Ireland. Dealings in gold bullion are restricted, and no dealings take place in Ireland. Al- though there are no import restrictions, residents require specific exchange control permission to purchase gold coin or bullion outside Ireland. Specific exchange control permission also is required for the export of gold coin and bullion outside Ireland. Specific permission to buy or export gold coin or bullion normally is given only for bona fide numismatic or industrial purposes, respec- tively. Residents of Ireland are not permitted to hold gold abroad. Changes During 1984 Imports and Import Payments On various dates during 1984, within the context of Article 115 of the Treaty of Rome, imports into Ireland of specified textiles from other EC countries but originat- ing in certain third countries were restricted for tempo- rary periods. These restrictions had all expired by December 31, 1984. The affected countries and entities were Hong Kong, India, the Republic of Korea, Macao, Pakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Romania, Taiwan,t Turkey, and Yugoslavia. May 4. Imports into Ireland of specified textile products from Turkey were made subject to quantitative limitations until December 31, 1984, within the context of a safeguard measure taken by the European Commis- sion against Turkish textile exports to the European Community (European Commission Regulation No. 1258/84). tSee Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part Two, page 54. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ISRAEL (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement1 The currency of Israel is the Shekel. The authorities do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transac- tions; they intervene when necessary in order to smooth out fluctuations in rates and to maintain orderly condi- tions in the market. Authorized banks are permitted to deal in foreign exchange. At the end of the morning trading session, the Bank of Israel publishes an average of the quotations of the day as a representative rate. On December 31, 1984 the representative rate for the U .S. dollar was IS 638.71 per US$1. A levy of 1 percent of transaction value is imposed on purchases of foreign exchange by the public, including those involving PAT AM accounts (see below). Administration of Control Exchange control is the responsibility of the Control- ler of Foreign Exchange and is administered by the Bank of Israel, in cooperation with other government agen- cies, and is carried out through authorized banks. Prescription of Currency Payments and receipts must be effected in the cur- rency and manner prescribed by the exchange control authorities. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents' funds are held either in foreign currency accounts or in local currency accounts. The opening of nonresident foreign currency accounts does not require prior approval. The holder may freely effect transfers from his foreign currency account. He may also convert funds held in the account into local currency at the market rate of exchange. There are no restrictions on the opening by a nonresi- dent of a local currency account; such funds may be used locally in permitted transactions, including transfers between nonresidents. Nonresidents may reconvert into foreign currency any amount of shekels purchased with foreign currency, with proof of bank receipt. In addition, after clearing immigration, departing nonresidents may convert at the market exchange rate and transfer abroad up to US$500 equivalent in shekels without producing receipts. The sales proceeds of real estate and other investments may be transferred in their entirety if the original investment was made through an authorized dealer with foreign currency or State of Israel Devel- opment Loan bonds. 1 With effect from April 1, 1985, and w i th in the context of the policy undertakings announced on February 4, 1985, the Israeli authorities announced a system under which the exchange rate of the shekel would continue to f luc tua te, but prices of goods and services supplied under contracts of long duration (and normally denominated in foreign currency) would be fixed at the exchange rate of April 1, 1984, i .e ., IS 864 = US$1. Long-term contracts w i th the public sector were excluded from the coverage of the fixed rate. Resident Accounts in Foreign Currency Residents may maintain foreign currency deposits with authorized banks in Israel in either (1) nonresident deposit accounts which may, subject to conditions, be held by exporters and recent immigrants to Israel, or (2) PATAM-Restitution accounts which may only be held by recipients of restitution payments and certain disability pensions. In addition, all residents may maintain PAT AM accounts which are shekel, time, or deposit accounts denominated in foreign currency. In general, transac- tions on such accounts must pass through shekel as a unit of account. Banks are required to redeposit 100 percent of PAT AM demand and time deposits with the Bank of Israel. PATAM-Restitution accounts also are demand or time deposit accounts in convertible currencies with autho- rized banks, which must redeposit all of these foreign currency funds with the Bank of Israel. Funds deposited in restitution accounts are free of taxation. PATAM- Restitution accounts are permitted to be used up to a limit of US$1,800 for payment of expenses in connec- tion with travel and subsistence abroad in excess of the basic travel exchange allocation. Holders of PATAM- Restitution accounts may resell securities bought with funds in such accounts for foreign currency and may deposit the proceeds in a PATAM-Restitution account. Residents who are not holders of PATAM-Restitution accounts may deposit the foreign exchange proceeds from the sale of foreign securities in PAT AM accounts. Imports and Import Payments A few imports are prohibited from all sources. Beginning from October 1, 1984, imports of some 50 commodities considered to be luxury items are banned for a period of six months .2 With some exceptions, imports are free of licensing and administrative or quantitative restrictions. Some imports on a Restricted List are subject to approval; this list includes coffee, specified items of machinery, some meat, fish, and dairy products, sugar, certain textiles, explosives and in- flammables, tobacco, and nonalcoholic beverages. Soy- beans are imported exclusively by or for account of the Government. Exchange to pay for authorized imports is granted automatically by the banks upon presentation of certain documents (bills of lading and letters of credit) or for repayment of suppliers' credits. For imports of motor vehicles for noncommercial use, it is obligatory to obtain foreign financing covering at least 75 percent of f .o .b. value and of average maturity of at least 30 months .3 A 2 On February 5, 1985, the ban was replaced by a noninterest- bearing deposit requirement (in shekels) amounting to 60 percent of import va lue, to be reduced by 3 percentage points a month until January 1986. 3 On April 1, 1985 the foreign f inanc ing requirement for imports of motor vehicles was lifted as part of a set of measures announced on that day. 281 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ISRAEL value-added tax of 15 percent is levied on almost all imported and domestically produced goods, other than capital goods and travel tickets.4 A 2 percent additional duty is levied on all imports subject to the value-added tax. Specified imports are subject to a one-year noninter- est-bearing deposit requirement of 15 percent of the value of imports, including customs duty, purchase tax, and other charges (with the exception of the value-added tax). Payments for Invisibles Exchange for payments abroad on account of invis- ibles is provided automatically upon proof of the nature of the transaction. The exchange allowance for tourist travel is the equivalent of US$1,000 a traveler for each journey, of which up to US$500 may be in bank notes5 and the balance in traveler's or bank checks. A lower limit for tourist travel of US$500 a traveler for each journey applies in the case of children aged 12 years and below. Foreign currency drawings by means of credit cards are included in the travel allowance. Resident travelers may take out Israel bank notes not exceeding US$50 a person a trip. Israeli residents traveling abroad are subject on departure to a travel tax equivalent to US$100 a person a journey; the shekel value of the tax is adjusted once a month.6 Payments for hotel accommoda- tion, land transport, and other related services under foreign package tours, along with other imports of services, are subject to the value-added tax of 15 per- cent. Nonresident travelers leaving Israel are permitted to repurchase through authorized dealers foreign cur- rency up to US$500 and may also take out up to IS 500 in Israel bank notes, in addition to the repurchase of foreign currency brought in by the nonresident traveler during his current visit. Commercial banks are autho- rized to sell abroad unlimited amounts of Israel currency. Exports and Export Proceeds Most exports do not require licenses, although for some commodities export licensing is retained for quality control. Export proceeds, which may be received in foreign currencies only, must be surrendered or held in a PAT AM account. Exporters may retain in a bank deposit abroad or in a special exporter account in Israel an amount equivalent to 10 percent of their turnover in the preceding year. For inputs directly imported by an exporter there is a system of rebates of customs duties, wharf charges, and other related charges. The Israel Foreign Trade Risks Insurance Company provides an export insurance facility to cover unfavorable move- ments in domestic currency costs as measured by 4On February 19, 1985, a travel tax of 20 percent was imposed on the value of travel tickets purchased in Israel. 5 The changes introduced on April 1, 1985 included a regulation that Israeli residents traveling abroad should not take with them a legal tender currency abroad other than the 24 currencies defined by the Israeli authorities as foreign currencies. 6On February 17, 1985, the tax on foreign travel by Israeli residents was raised (until October 1985) to US$150 a person, and travel to Egypt, which was previously tax exempt, was made subject to a tax of US$50 a person. 282 movements in the weighted average rate of the shekel against five major currencies, namely, the U .S. dollar, pound sterling, Netherlands guilder, French franc, and the deutsche mark. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange proceeds from invisibles must, in general, be surrendered or kept in foreign exchange in PAT AM accounts. Any resident is free to accept specified convertible currencies from tourists in payment for customary tourist services and commodities other than commercial exports, securities, and real estate. For 20 years after entering Israel, new immigrants are exempt from the requirement to surrender their foreign exchange to authorized dealers, and they may hold these foreign currencies freely with authorized banks in Israel or with banks abroad. There are no limits on the amounts of Israel bank notes or foreign currency that may be brought in by travelers. Capital Foreign exchange brought into Israel for the purpose of investment in the form of loan and equity capital may, subject to approval, be granted preferential treatment in accordance with the Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investment, which grants a limited withholding tax of 25 percent on income resulting from these investments. Approved investments (loan and equity) are granted exemption from the compulsory deposit require- ment. Approvals granted under the law are classified as "approved enterprises," "approved investments," or "ap- proved loans." Approved enterprise status is granted to enterprises in selected fields of production that are (1) in the fields of industry, tourism, transportation, and agriculture; (2) established in priority areas; or (3) export oriented or in the field of import substitution in some specific lines of production. Approved investment or approved loan status may be granted to any enterprise in the above-mentioned sectors; however, loans may only be shareholders' loans. The period of the loan should not be less than seven years and the rate of interest not more than 8 percent. Certain restrictions apply to borrowing in foreign currency by residents. A freeze is in effect on all such direct foreign borrowing by nonbank residents, other than suppliers' credits and loans with maturities of at least 30 months. Nonbank residents may, however, contract loans in foreign currencies from resident banks, subject to an interest surcharge of 1 percent. Voluntary prepayment of foreign obligations by residents is not permitted.7 Proceeds accruing from the repatriation or liquidation of foreign assets are treated in the same way as other proceeds in foreign currency. Residents are not normally 7 The changes in regulation on April 1, 1985 included restoration of authorization for Israeli residents to use funds in foreign commercial overdraft accounts. Such use had been effec t ive ly precluded by the Ju ly 25, 1984 regulation forbidding early repayment of external obligations. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution permitted to retain abroad real estate, money, securities, or the income from these assets. Residents may not buy foreign securities abroad, with the exception of specified types of Israeli firms' securities issued abroad with the approval of the Controller of Foreign Exchange. Resi- dent exporters and airline and shipping companies may maintain foreign bank accounts. New immigrants may retain their foreign assets for 20 years. Transfers abroad of a capital nature by residents other than new immi- grants are generally not permitted. Emigrants are per- mitted to transfer their Israeli assets abroad up to US$2,000 per year. Nonresidents are permitted to purchase in Israel real estate, shares, and debentures. In order to repatriate the principal or profits on these investments, proof is required by an authorized dealer that they were pur- chased with foreign currency through an authorized dealer. Direct loans in any form from Israeli residents to nonresidents are subject to licensing. Gold Gold bullion for industry may be imported by an importer holding an import license. Gold bullion and coins for investment, or certificates conferring a right to gold bullion, must be held in a gold custody account with an authorized dealer; beginning from January 1984, residents are not permitted to buy gold bullion or coins for investment purposes. The following bullion coins are at present included in a list of gold coins for investment: (a) Krugerrands of South Africa; (b) 50 dollar Maple Leafs of Canada; (c) 50 pesos of Mexico; (d) 100 corona and 4 ducat coins of Austria; (e) sovereigns of Great Britain; (f) 10 dollar and 20 dollar Liberty coins of the United States; and (g) 20 franc napoleon coins of France. Other gold coins and medallions may be bought, sold, or held by an Israeli resident without restriction. These coins may be imported and exported in the same manner as other goods. Imports of gold included in the above categories are subject to a value-added tax of 15 percent. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement July 24. Foreign exchange transactions were sus- pended for the day to permit the orderly introduction of changes to exchange control regulations. September 17. The shekel was depreciated against the U .S. dollar by 8 percent; the depreciation was additional to the routine changes in the exchange rate to reflect inflation differentials. Imports and Import Payments April 1. The 2 percent temporary import levy was extended for a further year, to March 31, 1985. June 1. The one-year noninterest-bearing import deposit requirement of 15 percent of the value of specified imports (including customs du ty, purchase tax, and other charges but excluding the value-added tax) first introduced in June 1983, and then renewed in ISRAEL December 1983, was extended again for a further six- month period, to the end of 1984. July 25. It was announced that for a period up to November 1, 1984, official foreign exchange sales for import prepayment were suspended. In addition, imports of investment goods and motor vehicles were made subject, until November 1, 1984, to a foreign financing requirement of average maturity of not less than 30 months for at least 75 percent of the f .o .b. value of the respective items. August 1. Authorization was granted for official foreign exchange sales for import prepayments in cases where a prepayment requirement was included in a long- term approved credit agreement, the amount of prepay- ment was under US$500, or a specific prepayment requirement was included in an import agreement dated before July 25, 1984. August 29. Exemptions from the requirement for 30- month foreign credit covering 75 percent of the value of imports were permitted where a bill of lading for the imports was dated prior to July 25; a minimum of 5 per- cent of the total bill for the imports was prepaid prior to July 25; investment goods were financed by owner loans; or the total amount of investment goods was less than or equal to US$500,000 and was part of an approved venture of an approved factory. October 3. Imports of some 50 commodities consid- ered to be luxury items, including passenger cars, large trucks, and sport boats, television sets, video recorders and audio equipment, air conditioners, certain kitchen equipment, liquor and soft drinks, and certain expensive building materials, were prohibited until April 2, 1985. (The ban was expected to affect imports amounting to US$700 million, on the basis of 1983 data.) Imports of newly banned items already stored in bonded ware- houses or en route to Israel on October 3 were made subject to a compulsory one-year deposit of 25 percent (not indexed to domestic prices) payable upon release from customs, in addition to the 15 percent import deposit requirement. November 1. The suspension of official foreign exchange sales for import prepayment (introduced on July 25, 1984) was extended until August 1, 1985, subject to the exemptions which came into effect on August 1, 1984. In addition, a new regulation was introduced, effective until August 1, 1985, permitting imports of investment goods against foreign currency credit with an average maturity of not less than 30 months and covering at least 75 percent of the f .o .b. value. December 1. The one-year noninterest-bearing import deposit requirement was renewed until May 31, 1985. Payments for Invisibles January 17. The foreign currency allowance for Israeli residents traveling abroad was reduced from US$3,000 to US$2,000 a trip. March 25. The tax on Israeli citizens traveling abroad was doubled to IS 14,510 (equivalent to US$100), with 283 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ISRAEL the shekel amount to be adjusted monthly in line with the cost of living index. July 25. The amount of domestic bank notes that residents traveling could take out was limited to the equivalent of US$50 a person a trip, and the previous allowance of up to the equivalent of US$2,000 a person a year for transfers by residents for support payments and gifts was suspended. (However, from August 1984, an allowance of US$200 a month for support payments to students studying at institutions of higher education was granted.) July 27. The application of the 15 percent value-added tax was extended until October 16, 1984 to imported services previously exempted, in particular to purchases of foreign exchange for foreign travel, though not to travel fares. The tax was to be collected by banks at the time of foreign exchange sales. October 3. A compulsory one-year deposit of 15 per- cent payable in domestic currency and not indexed to domestic prices was required on that part of foreign package tours covering payment for hotels, land trans- port, and other related services. In addition, the foreign currency allowance for Israeli residents traveling abroad was reduced from US$2,000 to US$1,000 for each journey for adults and to US$500 for children aged 12 years and under. November 13. A new imported services tax of 15 percent was introduced, effective until November 12, 1985, superseding the earlier extension of the 15 percent value-added tax to imported services, to be collected at the time of purchase of foreign exchange. Capital January 17. The amount of foreign currency which Israeli residents could hold or transfer abroad as support payments or gifts was reduced from US$3,000 to US$2,000 a year. In addition, it was announced that Israeli residents would no longer be permitted to hold bank accounts abroad (previously limited to US$3,000) except holdings of exporters in connection with their export proceeds, or to buy foreign currency securities except certain securities of Israeli firms issued abroad or foreign securities acquired before January 17, 1984. Existing foreign bank account holdings by Israelis were also required to be closed by April 1, 1985. Israeli emigrants would be permitted to transfer their Israeli assets abroad only by means of annual remittances not exceeding US$2,000 a person. July 25. The export of domestic bank notes by residents traveling abroad was limited to the equivalent of US$50 a person a trip. In addition, sales of foreign exchange for voluntary prepayment of foreign obliga- tions of Israeli residents were suspended until Novem- ber 1, 1984. November 1. The suspension of sales of foreign exchange for voluntary prepayment of foreign obliga- tions of Israeli residents was extended until August 1, 1985. Gold January 17. It was announced that Israeli residents would no longer be permitted to buy gold (bullion or coin) for investment purposes. 284 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ITALY (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Italy is the Italian Lira. Italy partici- pates with Belgium, Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands in the exchange rate and intervention mech- anism of the European Monetary System (EMS). In accordance with this agreement, Italy maintains spot exchange rates between the Italian lira and the currencies of the other participants within margins of 6 percent above or below the cross rates based on the central rates expressed in European Currency Units (ECUs). The agreement implies that the Bank of Italy (the central bank) stands ready to buy or sell the currencies of the other participating states in unlimited amounts at specified intervention rates. The participants in the EMS are not maintaining the exchange rates for other curren- cies within fixed limits. However, in order to ensure a proper functioning of the system, they intervene in concert to smooth out fluctuations in exchange rates, the intervention currencies being each other's and the U.S. dollar. Official rates for 19 foreign currencies1 are quoted daily on the basis of market rates.2 On December 31, 1984 the rate for the U .S. dollar was Lit 1,935.9 per US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. For outward transfers of resident-owned capital a deposit in lire of 50 percent (40 percent for investment in OECD countries, and 30 percent in the case of certain bonds) must be lodged with the Bank of Italy. Outward direct investment and portfolio investment up to 10 percent of the funds raised in the domestic market by Mutual Investment Funds are, however, normally exempt from the deposit requirement. The monetary authorities do not, in principle, inter- vene in the forward exchange market; forward premiums and discounts are normally left to the interplay of market forces. Authorized banks are allowed to engage in spot exchange transactions in any currency, and in forward exchange transactions up to 360 days in major convert- ible and externally convertible currencies.3 Forward cover is freely permitted only for commercial transac- tions; cover in respect of financial transactions requires authorization. Italy formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from February 15, 1961. Administration of Control The exchange control system is operated by the Italian Exchange Office (Ufficio Italiano dei Cambi, or UIC). All sales and purchases of exchange must be effected through banks authorized for this purpose. Import and export licenses, when required, are issued by the Ministry of Finance at the request of the Ministry of Foreign Trade. Certain imports and exports require the prior visa of the National Foreign Trade Institute. Issues of securities by nonresidents require the prior approval of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and are subject in addition to the rules governing the issuing of Italian securities in Italy. Payments to and from the Republic of San Marino or Vatican City are made in internal lire and therefore are not subject to exchange control. The net external position of the banks is subject to control by the UIC. This control encompasses (1) the net foreign position in foreign currencies and lire together; and (2) the overall position, spot and forward combined, in all foreign currencies; a balanced foreign currency position on a daily basis is required separately in (a) U.S. dollars, (b) EC currencies and ECUs, and (c) all other conto valutario currencies combined. Beginning from July 1984, each authorized bank is subject to a ceiling on its net foreign liability position, defined in terms of the position at the end of June 1984. The banks are prohibited from maintaining a net foreign asset position; in addition, outstanding net forward transac- tions against lire are subject to a ceiling set individually for each bank. Prescription of Currency Settlements with foreign countries must normally be made in convertible currencies or in lire on Foreign Accounts. Nonresident Accounts The main types of accounts in Italian lire which nonresidents are allowed to maintain with authorized banks are Foreign Accounts and Capital Accounts.4 The use of these accounts, and of Special Accounts for certain investments, is described below. Foreign Accounts may be credited with transfers from other Foreign Accounts, from Capital Accounts, and from Special Accounts Under Law No. 43, with lire from authorized current and capital payments, and with 1 Currencies off ic ia l ly quoted are Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, ECUs, Finnish markkaa, Greek drachmas, French francs, Irish pounds, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. 2 The official rate is the average of the "fixing" quotations of the foreign exchange markets in Milan and Rome. 3 These currencies are referred to in the Italian regulations as the conto valutario currencies. 4 Italians living or working abroad as well as "border-area" residents are permitted to maintain w i th Italian banks Emigrants' Foreign Currency Accounts denominated in conto valutario currencies. They may be credited with remittances (including bank notes) sent directly to the bank from abroad (up to 80 percent of the holder's wage or salary earnings) and w i th interest on the balance; they may be debited freely for conversion into lire, for withdrawals in foreign bank notes, and for transfers abroad (except for accounts held by "border-area" residents). These accounts may also be held by Italian representatives abroad and by Italian staff employed by international organizations. 285 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ITALY the proceeds from sales of convertible currencies. They may be debited for purchases of any of these currencies in the ordinary market, for transfers to any other Foreign Account, Capital Account, or Special Account for payments to residents of Italy for current and capital transactions, and for drawings in cash by the holder of the account or his nominee. Capital Accounts may be credited with transfers from Foreign Accounts, from Special Accounts, and from other Capital Accounts and with the proceeds from the liquidation of foreign investments in Italy not made under the provisions of Law No. 211 or Law No. 43 (see below). Capital Accounts may be debited for transfers to any other Capital Account or to Foreign Accounts and for the purchase of investments not made under Law No. 43, including purchases of personal property or real estate in Italy. Special Accounts Under Law No. 43 of February 7, 1956 are accounts in the names of nonresidents who have invested in Italy convertible currencies or externally convertible European currencies in accordance with the above-mentioned law. These accounts may be credited with the countervalue of convertible currencies sold in Italy, with transfers from Foreign Accounts, or from other Special Accounts, and with the proceeds from sales of investments that have been made in accordance with Law No. 43. They may be debited for purchases of the same currency that was originally sold and for invest- ments in Italy, and. balances may be transferred to Foreign Accounts, Capital Accounts, or any other Special Account. Nonresidents may also maintain "foreign accounts in foreign exchange" to which may be credited foreign exchange receipts from abroad, transfers from other "foreign accounts in foreign exchange," payments from residents for authorized transactions and, in approved cases, receipts from the sale of assets. Imports and Import Payments Imports are governed by a Ministerial Decree of May 6, 1976. The import regulations vary with the country of origin. Countries are grouped in three major areas: Zone A, which is subdivided into subzones A/1 (EC countries, Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, and Reunion), A/2 (overseas countries and territories, member countries of the European Free Trade Associa- tion, and other countries associated with the EC), and A/3 (third countries); Zone B, which comprises member countries of the Council for Mutual Econom- ic Assistance (CMEA), Albania, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; and Zone C (Japan). The import control proce- dures distinguish between goods that may be freely imported without quantitative restriction and goods that require a special license. Import liberalization is virtually complete for subzones A/1 and A/2, while very few quantitative restrictions remain for subzone A/3. Many types of goods from Zones B and C are heavily 286 restricted. For imports from countries in Zone B, as well as Egypt and Yugoslavia, the country of origin must also be the country of shipment. Imports from non-EC countries of most products covered by the Common Agricultural Policy of the EC are subject to variable import levies that have replaced all previous barriers to imports. Common EC regulations are also applied to imports from non-EC countries of most other agricultural and livestock products. For imports not exceeding Lit 5 million in value, no exchange control form is required; for imports from Lit 5 million to Lit 50 million in value, a form completed by the importer is required; for imports over Lit 50 million in value an import document completed by an authorized bank is required. Where settlement takes place more than 360 days after importation, the importer must choose an authorized bank as his bank of domicile, through which he must carry out all payments operations. Deferred payments for imports are permitted freely if settlement is to take place within five years after importation. Adv- ance payments for imports require special approval when they are to take place more than 120 days before importation, except that a 10 percent advance payment may be made up to 360 days before importation. Advance payments in excess of Lit 5 million must be made with foreign currency borrowed from authorized banks. When prepayments for imports exceed Lit 20 billion, an advance deposit of 5 percent is required. For all authorized imports, the authorized banks provide exchange or permit payment in Italian lire to a Foreign Account, provided that appropriate payment terms are observed (see section on Capital, below). International postal money orders may be used for import payments, subject, in some cases, to a limit for each remitter and foreign beneficiary. Payments for Invisibles The authorized banks may sell foreign exchange for payments for invisibles provided that the necessary documents are submitted. Their authority to sell ex- change for remittances as grants and aid is limited to Lit 300,000 a year, and approval of the UIC is required for transfers by Italian immigrants if the amounts exceed certain limits or if the transfer is to a country other than the country of origin. Exchange is granted freely for remittances of earnings or investments. Residents may use international postal money orders for payments, subject to a limit of Lit 1 million for each remitter and foreign beneficiary. Payments for services are governed by the same provisions regarding advance and deferred payments as are payments for imports. Certain transactions (but not the related payments) in respect of services are subject to approval by the Ministry of Foreign Trade. All contracts for insurance of ships and aircraft must be approved by the Ministry of Industry. Approval is also required for contracts in excess of Lit 5 million for services rendered by motion picture artists and technicians who are not residents of an EC member country. In addition, approval is required ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution for the following transactions if involving residents of countries that are not members of the IMF: repairs to ships and aircraft which are not urgent and necessary for safety of operation; expenditures in excess of Lit 5 million a month incurred by press agencies and corre- spondents of dailies and periodicals; and contracts in excess of Lit 5 million for the services of company managers, self-employed persons, athletes, and enter- tainers other than motion picture artists and technicians. There are no limits on expenditures for tourism. Residents traveling to foreign countries may obtain from the banks exchange equivalent to Lit 1,600,000 a person a trip and additional expenditures for tourism may be met by bank transfers or the use of credit cards. Authorized banks may grant foreign exchange without limit for business, medical treatment, and education, provided that they are satisfied that this is justified in view of the duration and purpose of the trip. The limit on the amount of Italian bank notes that can be taken out is Lit 400,000 in any denomination for each visit abroad.5 Nonresident travelers may take out any amount in foreign bank notes that they have previously declared upon entry, subject to a limit of the equivalent of Lit 1 million a person if an oral declaration is made, as well as Lit 400,000 in Italian bank notes of any denomination. However, the export of Italian bank notes in denominations larger than Lit 50,000 is prohibited. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to any country of a few commodities in a special list (Tabella Esporf) require export licenses. For exports not exceeding Lit 5 million in value, no exchange control form is required; for exports from Lit 5 million to Lit 50 million in value, a form completed by the exporter is required; for exports exceeding Lit 50 million in value, an export document completed by an authorized bank is required. If settlement takes place more than five years before exportation, the exporter must effect the payments operations related to his export transactions through an authorized bank as his bank of domicile. Advance payments for exports may be received freely if exportation is to take place within five years. Deferred payments for exports to non-OECD countries are per- mitted if settlement of at least 90 percent is to take place within 360 days after exportation and the balance within 24 months; if settlement is to take place between 120 days and 18 months after exportation, the operation must be assisted by bank financing covering no less than 50 percent of the credit. Except in the case of exports to OECD countries on delayed payment terms of up to five years, settlements beyond 360 days from shipment are subject to approval by the Ministry of Foreign Trade for amounts exceeding Lit 5 billion or by the UIC for amounts up to Lit 5 billion. In all other cases such 5 Persons l iv ing in border areas may not take out more than Lit 50,000 a day in domestic bank notes and coin, and the equivalent of Lit 50,000 a day in foreign notes and coin. ITALY receipts require the prior approval either of the Ministry of Foreign Trade or (for up to Lit 50 billion) of the Autonomous Agency for Export Credit Insurance (SACE), or of the Mediocredito if the payment term granted to the foreign importer is less than eight years, depending on whether the transaction w i ll be covered by state insurance or financed at a preferential interest rate under Law No. 227/77. All export proceeds must be surrendered to authorized banks w i th in 15 days of effective receipt. Proceeds in U .S. dollars, Canadian dollars, Japanese yen, and externally convertible European currencies may be re- tained by authorized banks on behalf of the recipients in "Foreign Exchange Accounts" for up to 15 days, during which period such balances may be used for permitted transactions or sold to authorized banks; the banks are allowed to sell these currencies to residents for autho- rized transactions or to negotiate them freely with the UIC or among themselves. In cases where documenta- tion is not in order at the time of surrender, proceeds may be posted to "Ordinary Waiting Accounts" for a period of up to 30 days from the date of surrender. If the necessary documents are not received un t il after the 30- day waiting period, the proceeds must be assigned to the UIC upon completion of the transaction and will be converted into lire at the lowest exchange rate quoted during the waiting period. Export proceeds may also be received by international postal money order, and in certain circumstances, in foreign bank notes that are accepted in the country of issue for credit to bank accounts, balances in which are convertible at official market rates. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from current invisibles are subject to the same collection, retention, and surrender requirements as receipts from exports. Shipping and insurance compa- nies and travel and forwarding agencies may keep Operating Accounts (Conti Autorizzati) in U .S. dollars, Canadian dollars, Japanese yen, and externally convert- ible European currencies; unutilized balances must be surrendered periodically. Residents may not retain foreign bank notes left over from trips abroad above the equivalent of Lit 100,000 but must sell them to an authorized bank. Persons may bring in any amount in foreign bank notes and Lit 400,000 in Italian bank notes in any denomination. Capital Inward and outward movements of nonresident capital are free, but most loans from nonresidents to residents and from residents to nonresidents require specific authorization from the Ministry of the Treasury or the Ministry of Foreign Trade, respectively; long-term loans (other than loans from financial institutions to nonresi- dents) from member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) for establishing or maintaining lasting economic relations, 287 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ITALY and loans to relatives up to the third degree of relation- ship, and some loans from certain German institutions to identified Italian residents do not require authorization. Short-term loans (up to one year and not exceeding Lit 250 million) and medium-term (up to five years and not exceeding Lit 250 million) financial loans (i.e., loans not connected with commercial operations or the perfor- mance of services) from EC countries also do not require authorization. Repayment of such loans may be made freely. A deposit requirement applies to outward transfers of resident-owned capital for direct investments, portfolio investments, financial loans, purchases of real estate, and personal capital movements. The transferor must lodge a lira deposit equivalent to a certain percent of the amount transferred in a noninterest-bearing account with the Bank of Italy. The rate is 40 percent for investments in OECD countries, 30 percent for investments in securities of EC institutions to be held at least one year, and 50 percent for all other investments; investments in foreign securities by mutual funds are exempt, within a limit of 10 percent of their total assets. In addition, when foreign investments are transferred between residents against lire, the transferee is subject to the deposit requirement, regardless of the date when the investment was made. The deposits are released only when, and to the extent that, disinvestment operations occur, and their release requires the prior approval of the Bank of Italy. Reinvestments of funds in new issues or on the second- ary market are exempt if the original investment was made prior to July 27, 1973. Purchases by residents of certain bonds issued by specified EC institutions are also exempt. Outward direct investment transactions have generally been given an ad hoc exemption. Exemptions are granted in respect of certain transactions such as direct investment abroad by industrial companies and banks; in other cases, such exemption is considered to have been tacitly granted if the authorities do not reply within 15 days. Prior approval of the Ministry of Foreign Trade is required for an Italian company to establish an overseas financial holding company; the parent company must, inter alia, submit annual audited accounts of such a holding company to the Ministry. Foreign investment in Italy is, in principle, governed by Law No. 43 and subsequent implementing regula- tions. Foreign investments of any kind, including both direct and portfolio investment and the purchase of real estate, are permitted freely, and no restrictions are applied to their repatriation. Direct investment in OECD countries by physical or juridical persons (other than participation by a financial institution that has its main office in Italy in a foreign company not having the same corporate purpose) is permitted in any form and without any l im i t .6 Direct investment in other countries may be made only by 6Financial investment, that is, investment not intended to establish permanent relations, is not considered direct investment. The regula- tions governing direct investment are also not applicable to partici- pations in "holdings" abroad of any k ind. 288 juridical persons in firms that are in the same line of business as that of the Italian firm making the invest- ment; other types of direct investment in such countries require special authorization from the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The general license to make these investments also covers the reinvestment of earnings and the use for this purpose of the liquidation proceeds of previous investments (after crediting the proceeds of the disinvestment to bank accounts similar to those estab- lished for proceeds from exports and invisibles; see section on Proceeds from Invisibles, above). Residents are free to buy and sell, through the Bank of Italy or the authorized banks, any foreign securities issued or payable abroad and quoted on foreign stock exchanges, and to deal in such securities among them- selves against payment in lire. Such foreign securities, except securities of Lit 300,000 or less, have to be deposited with an Italian bank or with a bank abroad for account of an Italian bank. The purchase by residents of shares of foreign financial institutions of any kind (including mutual funds), as well as convertible bonds issued by such institutions, requires prior approval by the UIC. In practice, however, a resident is able to purchase freely shares of foreign funds that have received authori- zation from the Ministry of Foreign Trade to sell their shares in Italy, since that authorization is valid also for the individual resident subscriber. Such authorization is given only to funds meeting certain requirements, including the investment in Italian securities of funds raised in Italy. Residents do not require authorization to purchase real estate in EC countries. All issues of securities by nonresidents on the Italian capital market require the prior approval of the Ministry of Foreign Trade after consultation with the Bank of Italy. Issues are normally restricted to international institutions. Transfers in connection with donations and inher- itances may be made freely. The transfer of property of residents leaving Italy permanently is allowed in two stages: the equivalent of Lit 5 million a person is allowed upon presentation of specified documents to an autho- rized bank at the time of leaving Italy, and the remainder is subject to examination of the documents by the UIC, when residence has been established abroad. Loans and credits (the latter only beyond a certain duration, generally 180-360 days) not connected with commercial transactions or with the performance of services require the approval of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and the Ministry of the Treasury. However, financial loans may be granted to or by residents of EC countries as indicated above. Gold Residents may freely hold and negotiate gold in any form in Italy, with the exception of unrefined gold imported under ministerial license for industrial pur- poses. The monetary authorities may freely acquire unrefined gold abroad. Agent banks may acquire unre- fined gold abroad, under authorization of the Ministry of the Treasury and the Ministry of Foreign Trade, to sell it ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution to Italian firms authorized by the Ministry of Foreign Trade for industrial use. Exports of wrought and semimanufactured gold, other than jewelry, are subject to licensing. Imports of unrefined gold are not subject to value-added tax. Importation and exportation of gold coins that are legal tender in a foreign country are prohibited in the absence of a special authorization. Imports of other gold coins for numismatic purposes are free but subject to value-added tax at 18 percent. Changes During 1984 Payments for Invisibles May 2. The annual limit on foreign exchange alloca- tion for tourist travel was abolished, and authorization was granted for Italian residents to export up to the equivalent of Lit 1.6 million in foreign exchange a trip. In addition, travelers could take abroad up to Lit 0.2 million a trip in local currency; and larger sums could be exported by bank transfers provided that expenditures were duly documented. (Previously, the overall foreign exchange allocation for tourists was Lit 1.6 million a person a year.) December 3. The limit on the amount of domestic currency that tourists could take abroad was increased from Lit 0.2 million to Lit 0.4 million. Within the limit of the foreign exchange allocation, the amount of foreign bank notes that tourists could take abroad was increased from Lit 0.3 million to ECU 700 (Lit 1.0 million). In addition, the use of credit cards to pay for tourist services ITALY was liberalized. (Previously, no more than Lit 1.6 million could be charged on credit cards for tourist purposes.) Exports and Export Proceeds July 10. Delayed payment terms not requiring UIC approval were increased to five years for exports to OECD countries (the same regime as previously ob- tained for EC countries only), and to 360 days for exports to non-OECD countries. December 3. The max imum period for which resi- dents could hold on to foreign exchange proceeds from exports was increased from 7 days to 15 days, and from 15 days to 30 days for proceeds posted to "Ordinary Waiting Accounts." Capital July 20. A ceiling on the foreign indebtedness of banks was imposed for an indefinite period. Italian banks must not exceed the level of total foreign indebtedness reached on June 30, 1984. December 3. The noninterest-bearing deposit in re- spect of investments abroad was reduced to 40 percent for investments in OECD countries, and to 30 percent for investments in securities of EC institutions to be held for at least one year (previously 50 percent for all transac- tions). In addition, such a deposit was abolished in respect of investments in foreign securities by mutual funds, within a limit of 10 percent of their total assets. 289 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution IVORY COAST (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Ivory Coast is the CFA Franc1 which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. The official buying and selling rates are CFAF 50 = F 1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market and the fixed rate between the French franc and the CFA franc. The BCEAO levies a commission of 0.10 per mill on transfers from countries outside the West African Mone- tary Union, and one of 2.50 per mill on transfers to such countries.2 Banks and the postal system also levy a commission on transfers to all countries outside the West African Monetary Union, part of which must be surren- dered to the Treasury. There are no taxes or sudsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of measures relating to gold and the repatriation of export proceeds, the exchange control measures of Ivory Coast do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Gabon, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Directorate of External Finance and Credit in the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The BCEAO is authorized to collect any information necessary to compile the balance of pay- ments statistics, either directly or through the banks, other financial institutions, the Postal Administration, and notaries public. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through authorized banks or the Postal Administration. Import and export licenses are issued by the Directorate of External Trade in the Ministry of Commerce. Prescription of Currency Since Ivory Coast is an Operations Account country, settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other Operations Account country. Current payments to or from The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are 'The CFA franc is issued by the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de 1'Quest (BCEAO) and is the common currency in Ben in, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo. 2 Transfers between member countries of the Union are subject to the flat commission of CFAF 100 levied on settlements between agencies of the BCEAO. 290 normally made through the West African Clearing House. Settlements with all other countries are usually effected through correspondent banks in France, in any of the currencies of those countries, or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. BCEAO bank notes may be credited to Foreign Accounts in Francs when they have been mailed to the BCEAO agency in Abidjan by authorized banks' foreign correspondents. Otherwise, the crediting to nonresident accounts of BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, or bank notes issued by any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury is prohibited. Foreign Accounts in Francs may be debited, without prior authorization, with the value of BCEAO bank notes that are mailed by authorized intermediaries to their foreign correspondents. Imports and Import Payments Imports from South Africa are prohibited. Under a decree that came into force on January 1, 1982, all imports are classified into four categories, as follows: (a) prohibited imports (e.g., wheat flour, and a specified type of coffee-husking machine); (b) import items (e.g., paints, matches, detergents, man-made fabrics, articles of leather, footwear, and carpets) for which import licenses are obligatory for each import transaction exceeding CFAF 25,000, f .o .b .; (c) import items requir- ing a declaration of intent to import; and (d) import items requiring both prior authorization and a declaration of intent to import; in the last two cases, (c) and (d), the requirements apply only to individual transactions ex- ceeding CFAF 100,000, f .o .b ., or CFAF 500,000 for goods considered essential. As noted below, certain other import items are subject to annual volume or value quotas. Imports of rice depend on domestic production, since they are intended as a supplementary means of satisfying domestic demand; such imports take place on the basis of an international invitation to bid or a government-to-government contract. All other imports may be made freely from any country; however, as mentioned above, when valued f .o .b. at CFAF 100,000 or more they are subject to the submission of a declaration of intent to import or to prior authorization, and when the f .o .b. value exceeds CFAF 1.5 million or more they are subject to mandatory preshipment inspec- tion by the Societe Generate de Surveillance (SGS), in order to control their price, quan t i ty, and quality. Tariffs have been raised for certain goods that compete with local production and, in the case of some goods, have been supplemented by annual volume quotas. Special ceilings have been set for selected imports from certain ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution countries having low production costs with which the trade balance has been consistently in large deficit. These quotas and ceilings are reviewed annually. All import operations relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value exceeds CFAF 500,000; transactions of lower value also must be domiciled with an authorized bank if a financial transaction is to be undertaken before customs clearance. The import licenses or import attestations entitle importers to purchase the necessary exchange, but not earlier than eight days before shipment, if a docu- mentary credit is opened, or only on the due date of payment, if the commodities have already been im- ported. Effective June 15, 1981 foreign exchange for import payments must be purchased either on the settlement date specified in the commercial contract or at the time when the required downpayment is made. Spot foreign exchange cover is limited to imports effected by means of documentary credits; the transaction must be domiciled with an authorized intermediary, and ship- ment of goods must be within eight days of the exchange operation. Forward exchange cover for imports in eligible cases must not extend beyond one month for certain clearly specified goods and three months for goods designated as essential commodities; no renewal of cover is possible. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are per- mitted freely; those to other countries are subject to approval. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Trans- fers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted freely when the basic transaction has been approved. Any resident may make payments abroad freely, at any time, through an authorized bank, up to the equivalent of CFAF 50,000 a month without submitting any documen- tation. Residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may obtain an exchange allocation for tourism of an amount equivalent to CFAF 175,000 a person a year (CFAF 87,500 for children under ten). For business travel a special foreign exchange allocation is authorized up to a maximum of CFAF 20,000 a day and CFAF 400,000 a trip. Any foreign exchange remaining in excess of CFAF 5,000 after return to Ivory Coast must be surrendered. The transfer of the full basic salary of a foreigner working in Ivory Coast is permitted upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher, provided that the transfer takes place within three months of the pay period. Resident and nonresident travelers to foreign countries may take out BCEAO bank notes up to CFAF 25,000. Travelers to other countries of the French Franc Area may take out any amount in BCEAO bank notes; however, if they travel to a country that is not a IVORY COAST member of the West African Monetary Union, the amount taken out must be declared to the customs if it exceeds CFAF 150,000. Nonresident travelers to foreign countries may freely take out foreign bank notes and coin up to the equivalent of CFAF 175,000, as well as any traveler's checks, etc., issued abroad. Subject to documentation, they may also take out any amount of traveler's checks, etc., in foreign currency established in their name after conversion of foreign currency into CFA francs, or drawn against a Foreign Account in Francs, or in a foreign currency in Ivory Coast. Nonresidents who have made a currency declaration upon entry or are able to show the proper banking notices may take out larger amounts. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. Most exports are free of license and require a declaration only. Exports of certain processed and unprocessed agricul- tural commodities, however, require the visa of the Directorate of External Trade. The due date for payment in respect of exports to foreign countries, including those in the French Franc Area, must not be later than 180 days after the arrival of the goods at their destination. Regardless of the currency of settlement and the buying country, export receipts must be collected and repatri- ated through authorized intermediary banks within one month of the due date. Regardless of destination, all export transactions must be domiciled with an authorized bank when valued at more than CFAF 500,000. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Ac- count countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services, and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be collected and surrendered within two months of the due date or the date of receipt. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BCEAO, the Bank of France, or any bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) of countries outside the French Franc Area; residents bringing in foreign bank notes or other foreign means of payment must sell any amount in excess of CFAF 5,000 to an authorized bank within eight days and must make a declaration to the customs upon entry. Capital Capital movements between Ivory Coast and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Ac- count countries are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require exchange control approval, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. Special controls (additional to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable) are maintained 291 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution IVORY COAST over borrowing abroad, over foreign inward direct investment, over all outward investment in foreign countries, and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Ivory Coast. Such operations require prior authorization by the Ministry of Economy and Finance as do issues by Ivory Coast companies. Exempt from authorization, however, are operations in connection w i th (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Ivory Coast Government and (2) shares similar to securities whose issuing, advertis- ing, or offering for sale in Ivory Coast has already been authorized. With the exception of controls relating to foreign securities, these measures do not apply to relations with France (as defined above), Monaco, member countries of the West African Monetary Un ion, and the Operations Account countries. Special controls are maintained also over imports and exports of gold, over the soliciting of funds for deposit w i th foreign private persons and foreign firms and institutions, and over publicity aimed at placing funds abroad or at subscribing to real estate and building operations abroad; these special controls also apply to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries. All investments abroad by residents of Ivory Coast require prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance.3 Foreign direct investments in Ivory Coast4 are subject to prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. Effective June 15, 1981 at least 75 percent of investments abroad by residents of Ivory Coast must be financed by borrowing abroad. The liquidation of investments, whether direct investments or not, in Ivory Coast or abroad must similarly be reported in advance to the Minister. Both the making and the liquidation of investments, whether these are Ivory Coast investments abroad or foreign investments in Ivory Coast must be reported to the Minister within 20 days follow- ing each operation. Direct investments are defined as investments implying control of a company or enter- prise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. Borrowing by residents from nonresidents requires prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans taken up by industrial firms to finance transactions abroad, to finance imports into or exports from Ivory Coast, or by approved international trading houses to finance international merchanting transactions; (2) loans contracted by authorized banks; and (3) loans other than those mentioned above, when the total amount outstanding of these loans, including the 3 Inc lud ing those made through foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons resident in Ivory Coast and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies resident in Ivory Coast. 4 Inc lud ing those made in Ivory Coast by companies that are directly or ind i rec t ly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in Ivory Coast of foreign companies. 292 new borrowing, does not exceed CFAF 50 million for any one borrower, and provided that the annual interest rate does not exceed the normal market rate. The repayment of loans constituting a direct investment is subject to the formalities prescribed for the liquidation of direct investments. The repayment of other loans re- quires authorization only if the loan itself was subject to prior approval. Lending abroad is subject to exchange control authorization. Law No. 59-134 of September 3, 1959 provides tax and customs duty benefits and other special privileges for new enterprises recognized as having priority status. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Ivory Coast. Imports and exports of gold from or to any other country require prior authoriza- tion by the Minister of Economy and Finance, which is rarely granted. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports and exports by the Treasury or the BCEAO; (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles contain- ing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold- plated articles); and (3) imports and exports by travelers of gold articles up to a weight of 250 grams. Both licensed and exempt imports and exports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Changes During 1984 Imports and Import Payments November 8. Legislation was promulgated (Laws No. 84-1233 and No. 84-1235) empowering the Coun- cil of Ministers to issue decrees imposing temporary surcharges on certain imports. The surcharges, which were intended to replace existing quantitative restric- tions, would be in effect for a period of five years, declining progressively dur ing the period. Imports originating from member countries of the "Communaute des Etats de TA f r ique de TOuest" (CEAO) and the "Communaute Economique des Etats de TAfrique de T Quest" (CEDEAO) were to be exempted from the surcharge. Exports and Export Proceeds November 8. Law No. 84 —1238 was promulgated, instituting an export premium based on the domestic value added for products manufacured in the Ivory Coast. The premium would not apply to products covered under taxation agreements within the West African Economic Community. In addition, export taxes were waived for products receiving the premium. Capital November 8. In a modification of the investment code, new incentives were introduced for both foreign and domestic investments in certain priority sectors and priority geographical areas. The new incentives included exemption from customs duties and tariffs on all im- ©International Monetary Fund.

In addition, all such investments would be exempted for a specified period, depending on the investment sector or area, from corporate profit taxes, patent contributions, and capital assets taxes. In general, the exemption would cover 100 percent of applicable tax up to the third to last year of the exemption period, and would be reduced progres- sively to 75 percent of the tax in the second to last year of the exemption period, 50 percent in the penultimate year, and 25 percent in the last year of the exemption period. Un l ike the former code, the new one did not provide for exemptions from customs duties and tariffs on imports of intermediate goods and raw materials for which similar items were not being produced locally. IVORY COAST 293 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution JAMAICA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Jamaica is the Jamaica Dollar, for which the spot exchange rate in terms of the U.S. dollar is determined at an auction conducted two times a week by the banks. On December 31, 1984 the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar, the intervention cur- rency, were J$4.95 = US$1 and J$4.91 = US$1, respectively. Jamaica avails itself of wider margins. There are no taxes on sales of foreign exchange. The Bank of Jamaica's dealings against Jamaica dollars are confined to transactions in certain major currencies.l For spot dealings with commercial banks in the major currencies, the Bank of Jamaica charges no commission on purchases but 0.0625 percent is charged on sales.- The commercial banks apply a commission charge of 0.375 percent on sales of currencies of nonmembers of the Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM) and a discount charge of 0.125 percent on purchases of these currencies. For currencies of mem- bers of the CARICOM, the commercial banks apply a commission charge of 0.25 percent on sales and a discount charge of 0.25 percent on purchases. Commer- cial banks are allowed to engage in forward transactions in respect of certain commercial transactions subject to specified limits on their net uncovered positions. Jamaica formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from February 22, 1963. Administration of Control The Bank of Jamaica administers exchange control on behalf of the Minister of Finance, subject to certain limi- tations in respect of which the approval of the Minister is required. The commercial banks are designated as autho- rized dealers. Except for the allowance for tourist travel, for which the commercial banks have authority to pro- vide foreign exchange, payments under the Special Re- tained Account, and transfers from External Accounts, all foreign exchange payments require the specific approval of the Bank of Jamaica. Commercial banks act as agents of the Bank of Jamaica only in respect of speci- fied transactions, mainly in the export sector. Import licenses are issued by the Trade Administrator, who is responsible to the Minister of Industry and Commerce. Prescription of Currency Payments to all countries may be made by crediting Jamaica dollars to an External Account or in any foreign currency.2 Receipts from all countries must be received 'Canad ian dollars, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, U .S. dollars, and the currencies of member countries of the CARICOM. The CARICOM countries are An t igua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Christopher and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. 2 All currencies other than the Jamaica dollar are considered foreign currencies. All foreign currencies have been designated as specified currencies. 294 by debit of an External Account or in any foreign currency. Nonresident Accounts The commercial banks are empowered to open Exter- nal Accounts in Jamaica dollars for nonresidents, pro- vided that no credit of Jamaica dollars is made to the accounts without the specific approval of the Bank of Jamaica. The funds on these accounts may be transferred freely between nonresidents. External Accounts may be credited with payments by residents of Jamaica that have been approved by the Exchange Control Authority, with transfers from other External Accounts, and with the proceeds from the sale to an authorized dealer of gold or foreign currencies. They may be debited for payments to residents of Jamaica, for transfers to other External Accounts, and for the purchase of foreign currencies. Accounts that are credited with funds that may not be placed at the free disposal of nonresidents of Jamaica (including the proceeds from the sale of undeveloped land) are designated Blocked Accounts. Blocked funds may be used without limitation by nonresidents for local expenditure while they are in Jamaica, and for invest- ment in Jamaica dollar securities or local mortgages, or both. Applications for the release of funds in Blocked Accounts in excess of J$5,000 a calendar year, for use in Jamaica by the nonresident owner, must be referred to the Bank of Jamaica. As an exception to the surrender requirement for foreign exchange, approved importers may open special foreign exchange accounts in commercial banks in Jamaica; payments from such accounts can be made only for authorized expenditures. Imports and Import Payments Imports originating in South Africa are prohibited. A number of goods may be imported freely from virtually all sources under an open general license.3 All other imports require specific licenses, irrespective of origin.4 For some goods, licenses are not normally issued unless they originate in member countries of the CARICOM .5 Imports are subject, in principle, to a global annual ceiling. Certain food items and all motor vehicles may be imported only by a public sector agency, the Jamaica Commodity Trading Corporation. Payments for imports are subject to prior registration with the Bank of Jamaica, and all payments for imports are subject to the licensing requirements, if any, being 3For these goods, the open general license applies to all countries except South Africa. Goods imported under the license must be consigned from one of the permitted countries and must also originate in a permitted country. 4 As part of changes introduced on January 10, 1983, import licenses were replaced by import permits issued to importers up to specified value quotas for items not on the restricted list. 5For import licensing purposes, the Bahamas is treated as a CARICOM member country. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution met; the importer must present a copy of the settlement invoice or other evidence of purchase and value, together with documentary evidence that the goods either have been shipped or are about to be shipped or that the importer is under contract to make prepayment up to six months prior to shipment. Exchange control approval is required for advance payments, but is generally granted to importers who are required by their commercial banks to make prior deposits in foreign exchange before opening letters of credit. Importers may buy foreign exchange forward for a period of one to six months prior to the date of shipment of the goods. Certain goods are subject to a consumption tax, whether they are imported or manufactured domes- tically. In addition, a 10 percent stamp duty tax is applied to imports, with the exception of government imports, basic food items, crude petroleum, fuel for utility companies, imports from CARICOM countries, and most raw materials. These taxes are collected at the port of entry and are calculated on the sum of the value accepted for customs and the customs du ty. In December 1978 the authorities initiated a scheme whereby, within certain limits, priority for access to foreign exchange is granted to those importers who qualify for "certified exporter status." Access to that status is linked to past and projected export performance and to the local value-added content of the exported product. There are arrears in respect of payments for imports. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles require the approval of the exchange control authorities. Foreign exchange is not, as a rule, made available for remittances of income from emigrants' property in Jamaica, for remittances for family maintenance, or for cash gifts. In the case of transfers from emigrants' income and payments for family maintenance, limited exceptions may be ap- proved by the Minister of Finance on humanitarian grounds. All interest and dividends payable to nonresi- dent investors are approved net of taxation. A basic exchange allowance of US$55 a person for each calendar year for foreign travel other than for business or professional reasons is made available to residents by authorized dealers. The sale of foreign exchange for travel for business and professional reasons is subject to the specific approval of the Bank of Jamaica and to daily limits of US$125 a day for the United States and US$175 a day for Europe. The number of days for which the approval is granted is determined on the merits of each case. Expenses for hotel accommodations, meals en route, etc., that are settled in Jamaica in domestic currency must be deducted from the travel allocation. Non-Jamaicans working in Jamaica under a work permit are allowed to remit abroad 30 percent of their gross salary during the period of their contract and their accumulated assets at the end of the contract period. Residents going abroad may take with them Jamaica bank notes not exceeding J$20 and other bank notes not JAMAICA exceeding the equivalent of J$50. Bona fide requests for additional amounts are approved by the Bank of Ja- maica. Nonresidents may take out the foreign currency notes they brought in. All visitors to Jamaica carrying more than US$500 or its equivalent must declare the foreign exchange they bring in or take out of Jamaica. There are arrears in respect of invisible payments. Exports and Export Proceeds All goods valued at not more than J$300 ( f .o .b .) may be freely exported by post or air express to any country not on the prohibited l is t .6 Where the value exceeds J$300, the goods may still be exported to all countries except those on the prohibited list, but a specific license is required for the export of certain agricultural products, ammunition, explosives, firearms, antique fu rn i tu re, ready-made garments, gold bullion, mineral and metal ores, and antique paintings. Exporters are required to surrender their exchange proceeds to authorized dealers within three months from the date of shipment. How- ever, w i th the approval of the exchange control authori- ties, certain exporters may retain an agreed portion of their settlement of overseas commitments, as may be necessary for their operations; such retained export proceeds must not be sold to other nonbank residents. Exporters of specified nontraditional products are allowed to sell foreign exchange earnings forward, subject to fu lf i l lment of surrender requirements. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in foreign currencies must be sold to an authorized dealer. Residents returning to Jamaica may bring in Jamaica bank notes up to J$20 a traveler, provided that this amount was declared on leaving the country, and all travelers may bring in or take out Jamaican currency. Resident travelers are required to sell their holdings of foreign currencies to an authorized dealer upon return. Tourists are required to settle their hotel bills in foreign currencies, unless they can prove that they had purchased w i th foreign currency an equivalent amount of Jamaica dollars from an authorized bank in Jamaica. Capital Outflows of resident-owned capital are restricted, irrespective of their destination. Investments abroad by residents and the purchase of local assets by residents from nonresidents require the approval of the exchange control authorities and are not approved, unless they result in tangible benefits for Jamaica. Foreign exchange is not made available to residents to make cash gifts to nonresidents. With the exception of certain types of investment in real estate, all approved direct investments in Jamaica by nonresidents are granted "approved status," under which 6The list comprises A lban ia, Bu lgar ia, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Repub l ic, Hunga ry, Poland, Romania, South A f r ica, and the U .S .S .R. Exports to these countries require specific licenses. In practice, no licenses are issued for exports to South Afr ica. 295 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution JAMAICA the investor is given written assurance that he will at any time be able to repatriate his original investment plus any capital gain. In order to obtain approved status, the investor must apply to the Bank of Jamaica. Nonresidents are normally not permitted to take up security in respect of loans made to Jamaican companies owned or controlled by them. Domestic bank credit to nonresidents and to nonresident-controlled companies is subject to selective credit controls; for this purpose, firms are considered to be nonresident-controlled when the controlling interest is held beneficially, either di- rectly or indirectly, by persons resident outside the CARICOM area. Such lending is subject to approval by the Bank of Jamaica. There is a fixed-term foreign currency deposit scheme for both residents and nonresidents. Accounts under this scheme may be credited with any means of payment, except cash or traveler's checks, but the transactions must be effected through a commercial bank; the deposits are freely repatriable upon maturity. In general, non-Jamaican nonresidents are not per- mitted to raise local mortgages. However, nonresidents working in Jamaica under a work permit may acquire a house to live in, with the permissible amount of mortgage restricted to 50 percent. Foreign nonresident owners of land in Jamaica, when selling to residents, are allowed to remit from Jamaica, in the first instance, the amount they paid originally from funds brought into Jamaica; the balance of the sale price can be remitted annually in ten equal installments, subject to a maximum remittance in any one year of J$l0,000, except where the owner had received a previous undertaking that the investment in land carried "approved status." Foreign nonresident owners of houses built on residential lots are treated similarly, provided that the nonresident seller can satisfy the Bank of Jamaica as to the amount spent in Jamaica in acquiring the lot and constructing the build- ing. Except for special cases, which may be approved by the Minister of Finance on humanitarian grounds, no foreign exchange is made available for remittances of capital or income to Jamaican nationals who have emigrated abroad and to beneficiaries under wills and intestacies. Between January 1977 and March 1979 principal payments for private nonguaranteed debt were not being released. Applications received up to June 1978 for the remittance of principal were placed in the Deposit Scheme and were released between April and December 1979. The balance of outstanding private, nonguaranteed debt has been consolidated with repayment scheduled over a 70-month period which began in January 1980. Gold Commemorative gold coins in denominations of J$20, J$100, and J$250 are legal tender but do not circulate. Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Jamaica for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized 296 industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Ministry of Finance; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. All commercial imports of jewelry require import licenses. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement March 20. In addition to commercial banks, importers with foreign exchange requests in excess of US$50,000 were allowed to participate in the foreign exchange auction market, and the frequency of the auction was reduced from four to two per week. April 17. Eligibility to purchase foreign exchange in the auction market to meet payments due prior to February 1, 1984 was withdrawn, and the consequent arrears were made subject to phased repayment. May 8. Importers were allowed to bid in the foreign exchange auction market to enable them to fu l f i ll commercial bank requirements that prior deposits (in foreign exchange) be made before letters of credit could be opened. August 30. The right to bid in the auction market in order to procure resources with which to make prior deposits against letters of credit was withdrawn (see following entry for September 4, 1984). September 4. The auction participation right with- drawn in August 1984 was restored, thereby allowing importers to bid in the auction market for foreign exchange with which to open letters of credit. September 20. A requirement was introduced that bidders in the foreign exchange auction market should each present a certificate indicating that they were current with regard to all tax payments. In addition, it was announced that exporters of nontraditional goods would be expected to fu l ly utilize available import credits from the Export Development Fund before being permitted to purchase foreign exchange in the auction market. October 19. The requirements imposed on September 20, 1984 in respect to both tax compliance and nontradi- tional exporters were abolished. December 10.

Not for Redistribution JAPAN (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Japan is the Japanese Yen. The authorities of Japan do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions and exchange rates are deter- mined, in principle, on the basis of underlying demand and supply conditions in the exchange markets. How- ever, the authorities intervene when necessary in order to counter disorderly conditions in the markets. The prin- cipal intervention currency is the U .S. dollar. The interbank rate for the U .S. dollar on December 31, 1984 was ¥ 251.60 per US$1. Authorized banks may freely carry out spot and forward exchange transactions with nonresident banks and among themselves. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Japan formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from April 1, 1964. Administration of Control The exchange control system is operated mainly by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), and the Bank of Japan acting as the Government's agent. Most of the authority for verifying normal payments is, however, delegated to authorized banks referred to as foreign exchange banks. Import and export reporting requirements are handled by the MITI. Inward direct investments are under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Finance and other appro- priate ministers. Outward direct investment requires prior notice to the Minister of Finance. Prescription of Currency Payments to all countries may be made in any currency, including yen, and receipts also may be obtained in any currency. Nonresident Accounts Nonresident Accounts in yen may be opened by any nonresident with any authorized bank in Japan. There are no restrictions on credits to or payments from these accounts, and balances may be converted freely into any foreign currency. Payment of interest on balances in such accounts may be restricted when it is deemed necessary to prevent drastic fluctuations in the exchange rate of the yen. Imports and Import Payments Imports can be freely made, with the exception of specifically restricted items. The Import Restriction System covers 80 items, 27 of which have been notified to the GATT as residual restrictions, while the remaining items have been notified as falling under the state- trading, national security, public health, and moral 298 protection provisions of the GATT. For the restricted items, once the importer has obtained authorization from the MITI, he receives an import quota certificate that entitles him to receive an import license from an authorized foreign exchange bank automatically upon application. For the importation of certain other goods from specified countries or shipping areas, individual authorization must be obtained from the MITI. Items under state trading include certain dairy prod- ucts, certain cereals, salt, raw silk, raw and manufac- tured tobacco, poppy straw, raw opium, and ethyl and denatured alcohol. Payment for imports may be effected up to one year before the import declaration or after customs clearance. Longer settlement periods require an import license from the MITI. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles may be made without any limitation. Gifts and donations to nonresidents (except relatives abroad) exceeding ¥ 5 million are referred to the Bank of Japan, which approves the payment after verifying its authenticity. However, remittances to rela- tives abroad, as well as other current payments for invisibles, such as the purchase of foreign currencies in connection with travel abroad, may be made without limit. Both residents and nonresidents may acquire foreign currency deposits with authorized banks in Japan and may take out freely any amount in any foreign currency; in the case of Japanese yen, the freely exportable limit is ¥ 5 million. Overseas deposits by resident individuals up to the equivalent of ¥ 3 m i l l ion* are subject to automatic approval by the Bank of Japan. Qualified Japanese enterprises in insurance, transportation, securities, etc., are permitted to acquire overseas deposits under blanket licensing. Exports and Export Proceeds Export restraint may be exercised by virtue of the Export and Import Transactions Law and an Export Trade Control Order issued under the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law. Export restraint may be applied either globally or to specified destinations, and it may cover export volume, or export prices, or other conditions. Exports of passenger cars to the United States were subject to quantitative limits for the three- year period ended April 30, 1984; a quantitative limit has also been set for the subsequent one-year period. Exports of steel and some textile items to the United States and exports of videotape recorders to the EC are also subject 1 The max imum amount eligible for automatic approval by the Bank of Japan was increased to ¥ 10 million w i th effect from January 1, 1985. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution to quantitative restrictions. At the end of 1984, there were 54 export cartels under the provisions of the Export and Import Transactions Law. Of these, 43 required prior notice of exporters' agreements in respect of export transactions, 11 required prior approval of manufactur- ers' agreements on domestic transactions in goods for export, and 8 were reinforced by an export transactions license requirement. In addition, 195 items were subject to license under the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law, in order to control their export to specified socialist countries, or because of short supply in the domestic market (e.g., tungsten ore), or to forestall the imposition of import restrictions by other countries (e.g., on sewing machines and certain textiles). Exports under processing contracts and exports for which settlement is under the "special" method also require individual licenses. Exports of specified raw materials for foreign processing and reimport require individual licenses; "special" settlement methods are those effected by means of open account or those involving payment later than one year after shipment. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles may generally be accepted without a license. Residents as well as nonresidents may bring in freely any amount in Japanese or foreign currency. Capital Capital transactions are permitted unless specifically restricted. Such specific restrictions may take the form of requiring (1) prior approval; (2) prior notice with a waiting period, during which the minister or ministers concerned may request or order that the transaction be suspended or its particulars be modified on the basis of prescribed criteria; or (3) prior notice without a waiting period. Other transactions are normally free. Under emergency conditions, most capital transactions not subject to specific restrictions may be subjected to prior approval; emergency conditions are defined as situations in which a capital transaction might (1) make the maintenance of equilibrium in Japan's balance of pay- ments difficult; (2) result in drastic fluctuations in the exchange rate; or (3) result in an international flow of funds large enough to adversely affect Japan's money or capital market. A distinction is made between direct investment in Japan and other capital transactions. Besides majority equity ownership of enterprises or establishment of branch operations, other types of investment that come under the direct investment regulations include (1) any acquisition of shares in unlisted companies; (2) acquisi- tion of 10 percent or more of the shares of a listed company (including individual companies for which the stock price in over-the-counter transactions is made public by the Securities Dealers Association) by a single foreign investor; and (3) acquisition of loans of more than one-year maturity or securities privately placed in Japan, under certain circumstances. Any change of JAPAN business objectives of a company w i th more than one- third foreign ownership is also subject to the provisions for direct investment. Requests or orders for suspension or modification of specific aspects of the transaction may be made if the minister or ministers concerned consider the transaction to have adverse implications for national security, public order, public safety, the activities of Japanese enterprises in related lines of activities, the general performance of the economy, or for the mainte- nance of mutual equality of treatment of direct invest- ment with other countries. Acquisition of securities for portfolio through desig- nated securities firms can be freely made, but acquisition of such securities through securities firms other than the designated ones requires prior notice without a waiting period. Transactions requiring prior notice with a 20-day waiting period may be subjected by the Minister of Finance to suspension or modification if, in his opinion, the transaction might adversely affect (1) domestic and international money markets, (2) Japan's international reputation, (3) business activities of a sector of the Japanese industries or the smooth performance of the national economy, and (4) implementation of Japan's international agreements, international peace and secu- rity, or the maintenance of public order. The Minister of Finance may shorten the notification period when the transaction under consideration is deemed unharmfu l. Other transactions by nonresidents may be generally carried out freely. Outward investments by residents in the form of loans, usance exceeding one year, issue of yen- denominated bonds in Japan by nonresidents, and direct investment abroad are subject to prior notice with a 20- day waiting period. The criteria for suspension or modification of specific aspects of such transactions are as in the preceding paragraph. Foreign currency deposits overseas by residents and borrowing and lending in foreign currency between residents other than those carried out by an authorized bank in Japan require prior approval. Other external transactions by residents may normally be carried out freely. Foreign exchange banks are subject individually to controls over oversold or overbought position in foreign currency. Foreign loans by banks are legally subject to prior notice with a waiting period, but in most cases they can be made upon notification. The banks are free to lend yen on a long-term basis overseas to borrowers of their choice, and they can accept foreign currency deposits from residents and nonresidents and make foreign currency loans to residents; foreign currency or yen deposits of nonresidents as well as residents are subject to minimum reserve requirements adjusted from time to time by the Bank of Japan. Foreign banks are licensed to operate in Japan subject to Japanese banking regulations; they may obtain resources from inward remittances of foreign currency as well as from money markets in Japan. 299 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution JAPAN Gold Residents, including domestic producers of gold, may freely hold gold and purchase and sell it in domestic transactions. The import and export of gold bullion is free from licensing, but transactions exceeding 100 kilo- grams require notification to a customs house. Futures trading in gold can be freely made by designated companies. Changes During 1984 Imports and Import Payments April 1.

Not for Redistribution JORDAN (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Jordan is the Jordan Dinar, which is pegged to the SDR at JD 0.388 = SDR 1. The middle rate of the Jordan dinar for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is determined by the Central Bank of Jordan on the basis of the daily calculations of the U .S. dollar-SDR rate. On December 31, 1984, the buying and selling rates of the Central Bank for the U.S. dollar were US$2.4752 and US$2.4631, respectively, per JD 1, and those for sterling were £ stg. 2.1322 and £ stg. 2.1191, respectively, per JD 1. Buying and selling rates for other foreign currenciesl are fixed on the basis of the appropriate cross rates in international financial markets. A fee of 0.10 percent is levied on exchange permits approved by the Central Bank for sales of exchange for imports, except imports of government departments and certain other approved institutions. Forward exchange transactions in major currencies against the Jordan dinar are permitted in specified cases. For corporations or projects of vital national interest, the Central Bank may offer a forward exchange facility in respect of forward exchange cover by Jordanian banks. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Foreign Exchange Control Department of the Central Bank, which also issues exchange permits; the Central Bank has delegated to authorized banks the issuance of exchange permits for import payments and, within permitted annual limits, for payments for educational expenses of Jordanians studying abroad and for various other purposes. Import policy is determined by the Ministry of Industry and Trade in cooperation with the Ministries of Finance, Customs, Supply, and Agricul- ture. In addition, an Economic Security Committee is empowered to amend existing regulations or issue new ones concerning economic policy. Prescription of Currency Outward payments may be made in any currency. Proceeds from exports (except those of Jordanian goods to neighboring Arab countries or, excluding fruits and vegetables, up to JD 500 to other countries) and invisibles must be collected, and surrendered where required, in any convertible currency through an autho- rized bank in Jordan, or from a nonresident account with an authorized bank in Jordan. Nonresident Accounts Subject to the prior approval of the Central Bank, authorized banks may open nonresident accounts in 1 Belgian francs, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. 302 domestic currency; these accounts may be credited only with approved funds. The approval of the Central Bank is necessary for transfers from resident to nonresident accounts, but transfers between nonresident accounts are permitted freely. In addition, nonresidents, including Jordanians working abroad, may freely open interest- bearing foreign currency accounts with authorized banks. Balances on these accounts may be withdrawn freely in convertible currency, and the interest rate is fixed in accordance with rates prevailing in international markets. Jordanian nationals residing in Jordan may maintain foreign currency deposits with licensed banks in Jordan, provided that such deposit accounts are credited with foreign currencies from any source except the banking system and that the total of the deposits that any one person holds does not exceed the equivalent of JD 30,000. Jordanians who have worked abroad for more than three years and have decided to return may open accounts in foreign currencies without limits for a period of up to five years, after which the deposits in excess of the equivalent of JD 30,000 must be converted into Jordan dinars. Foreign Currency Accounts Deposit accounts denominated in foreign currency may be opened at the Central Bank by governmental and semigovernmental entities, as well as the specialized lending institutions, licensed finance companies, and domestic corporations of vital national interest (includ- ing those companies in which the Government owns more than 25 percent of the capital), provided that outstanding balances (including interest earnings) in each account do not exceed JD 1.0 million. This ceiling can be raised to JD 3.0 million in certain cases. Imports and Import Payments Imports of certain items2 from any source, and all imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. All other imports, unless covered by an agreement between Jordan and the exporting country (i.e., agricultural products from neighboring countries), require import licenses if their c. & f. value exceeds JD 100. These are granted freely by the Ministry of Industry and Trade and are subject to a fee of 4 percent of the c. & f. value payable on the issue of the import license. Imports that require an import license also require an exchange permit, which is granted automatically when an import license has been obtained; the importer holding an exchange permit may either open a letter of 2These include carbonic acid; some nonalcoholic beverages; ciga- rettes; secondhand passenger cars and buses that are more than five years old; and military uniforms. Certain of these commodities may be imported, however, from Arab Common Market countries and from countries with which trade agreements are in force. Imports of certain agricultural commodities may be prohibited in good crop years. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution credit or pay against documents. A fee of 0.10 percent is levied on exchange permits for imports, except those made by government departments and certain approved institutions and individual permits of less than JD 500. The use of suppliers' credits is subject to prior approval by the Central Bank, which normally is given for essential imports only. In addition to import duties, a surcharge of 13 percent of the duty-paid value is levied on most imports to finance social welfare and the development of certain public facilities. Imports to Free Zones Outward payments to cover imports to free zones and transit trade require exchange permits; such permits are subject to a fee of 0.10 percent. As these imports are re- exported, the value of those permits plus a minimum profit of 5 percent must be returned to Jordan in foreign currency through an authorized bank in the Kingdom. Payments for Invisibles Remittances by postal order do not require exchange control approval, provided that they do not exceed JD 10 a person a month (JD 100 a person a month for Kuwait and Jordanian students in Yugoslavia, JD 50 for the United Kingdom, and US$125 for Algeria). Payments for the following types of invisibles are generally permitted within certain limits: remittances to residents' dependents; reasonable living expenses of Jordanian nationals abroad; expenses of Jordanian residents travel- ing abroad; educational expenses; expenses for medical treatment; business expenses abroad; and insurance payments in accordance with special regulations.3 A fee of 0.10 percent is levied on exchange permits for invisible payments except those of government depart- ments and certain approved institutions, permits fi- nanced from nonresident accounts in foreign currency, and those with a value under JD 500. No limit exists on the remittance of income accrued to nonresidents or savings of foreign nationals who intend to return to their own countries. The exchange allowance for business and tourist travel is the equivalent of JD 5,000 a person (JD 500 for children under 18). These allowances are granted an- nually for one or more trips. For family support, an annual allowance of JD 5,000 for each beneficiary is permitted; however, remittances by postal order may be made for amounts not exceeding the equivalent of JD 10 a month to any one person resident abroad (JD 100 a month for Kuwait and Jordanian students in Yugoslavia, JD 50 for the United Kingdom, and US$125 for Algeria), and are not subject to this ceiling. The policy in respect of payments for invisibles is, in general, liberal and nondiscriminatory. In practice, the Central Bank does not restrict remittances of income accruing to nonresidents or of savings of foreign nationals returning to their own countries. JORDAN In addition to any travel allocation, residents and nonresidents traveling abroad may take out up to JD 300 in Jordanian notes and coin and any amount in foreign notes and coin, provided these are for their own use. Nonresidents working in Jordan can transfer 70 percent of their salaries if they maintain a nonresident Jordanian dinar account; if they do not have such accounts, they can transfer up to JD 100 monthly with a total amount not exceeding JD 1,200 annually. Furthermore, all travelers may take out checks, traveler's checks, or letters of credit issued by authorized banks in Jordan, in accordance with exchange permits authorized by the Central Bank. Tourists and other nonresidents may also take out foreign currency notes and coin and any other foreign means of payment that they had previously brought in and declared to the customs authorities at the time of entry. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Export proceeds must be collected and the foreign exchange surrendered within six months of shipment. Exempt from this requirement are the proceeds from exports of Jordanian products to neighboring Arab countries, and proceeds of up to JD 500 from exports (excluding fruits and vegetables) to other countries. Exporters and residents of Jordan are not permitted to maintain bank balances abroad for any purpose. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange receipts from invisibles must be surrendered to an authorized bank or, if bank notes and traveler's checks are received, to an authorized bank or to an authorized exchange dealer. Travelers entering Jordan may bring in any amount in Jordanian and foreign notes and coin.4 Any person regarded for exchange control purposes as resident in Jordan may be required by the Central Bank to surrender to an authorized bank any foreign currency at his disposal. Capital Capital may be imported freely, but exports of capital require approval and are not normally allowed, except that the Central Bank is prepared to examine applications by banks, insurance companies, industrial or trading firms, and contractors for permission to transfer funds abroad for specified investment or operating purposes. Current income resulting from nonresident investments in Jordan may be transferred abroad. Under the Law for the Encouragement of Investment, profits from approved foreign investments may be remitted, without limitation, in any convertible currency. After two years, repatriation of the capital is permitted in three equal annual install- ments in any convertible currency. The Investment Committee may approve more liberal provisions, and 3 All insurance must be taken out in Jordan, but foreign exchange is granted for premiums in respect of insurance contracts concluded prior to May 1965. 4 Approval is not given for the crediting of such Jordanian currency to a nonresident account or for the remittance abroad of the equivalent in foreign currency. 303 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution JORDAN exchange permits are granted accordingly. The Compa- nies Registration Law No. 46 of 1975 provides various benefits for foreign companies establishing branches in Jordan for the purpose of conducting business outside the country; such branches may also be granted nonresident status for exchange control purposes. Premium Devel- opment Bonds denominated in Jordan dinars may be purchased with convertible currencies by nonresidents; maturity proceeds, premiums, and interest are transfer- able in any convertible currency. Gold The Central Bank has issued ten gold coins. These coins, although legal tender, do not circulate and are available only to nonresidents and domestic numisma- tists. Residents may purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in Jordan for numismatic or investment purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authori- ties and authorized industrial users are not, in principle, allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Licenses for imports of gold in any form other than jewelry are issued by the Ministry of Industry and Trade on the recommendation of the Central Bank, while exports of gold in any form require a license from the Central Bank. Changes During 1984 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 304 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution KENYA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Kenya is the Kenya Shilling, which is pegged to a basket consisting of the same currencies as the SDR basket. The middle rate of the Kenya shilling for the U.S. dollar quoted by the Central Bank is determined on the basis of the daily U.S. dollar-SDR rate. The Central Bank's buying and selling rates are each set at 0.15 percent below and above the rate thus determined. On December 31, 1984 buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were K Sh 15.7576 and K Sh 15.8015, respectively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates for certain other currencies! are determined on the basis of appropriate New York closing rates. The Central Bank does not deal in other foreign currencies, except occasionally on behalf of the Government. The Central Bank deals up to six months forward with commercial banks in sterling, U.S. dollars, and deutsche mark to cover their contracts with exporters and import- ers; commercial banks may cover their forward exchange contracts in outside markets in other foreign currencies against U.S. dollars or pounds sterling. Administration of Control The Minister of Finance and Planning has delegated the administration of exchange control to the Central Bank. Authority is delegated to the authorized banks for approving certain payments for imports, many payments for current invisibles, and some capital payments. Import and export controls are administered by the Director of Internal Trade and the Director of External Trade, respectively, in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The responsibility for issuing import and export licenses rests with the Director, to whom applica- tions must be submitted by the importer or the exporter in Kenya before orders are placed abroad or exports are shipped. Applications for the allocation of foreign exchange for imports are forwarded by the Director of Internal Trade to the Central Bank. The quota system is administered by the Import Management Committee (IMC) and the Official Import Committee (OIC), both of which are composed of representatives from the Minis- tries of Finance and Planning, Commerce and Industry, and the Central Bank. The IMC, under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, allocates quotas to individual importers, while the OIC, under the Ministry of Finance and Planning, sets global quotas.

Prescription of Currency Payments to residents of countries other than South Africa may be made in Kenya shillings to the credit of an External Account in Kenya or in any foreign currency. Receipts may be obtained in Kenya shillings from an External Account in Kenya or in any marketable foreign currency. Remittances to South Africa are prohibited, with the exception of pensions payable by the Govern- ment of Kenya. Nonresident Accounts Accounts in Kenya shillings held by residents of countries other than South Africa with authorized banks in Kenya are, with exchange control approval, desig- nated External Accounts. They may be credited freely with authorized payments to such countries by residents of Kenya, with transfers from other External Accounts, and with the proceeds from sales of any currency (other than South African currency) and gold by nonresidents to authorized dealers. External Accounts may be debited freely for payments to residents and nonresidents. Nontransferable funds of nonresidents are credited to Blocked Accounts. Subject to prescribed procedures, balances on Blocked Accounts (other than those in the beneficial ownership of residents of South Africa) may be used for approved domestic expenditures and for the purchase in Kenya of specified bonds issued by the Government or by local authorities and officially quoted in Kenya.2 The redemption proceeds of these securities are transferable, and interest is freely transferable to nonresidents as and when it accrues. Imports and Import Payments All imports from South Africa are prohibited. All imports are classified into four schedules: Schedules IA, IB, HAS, and IIB, and are subject to import licensing. All private sector imports require a license for the allocation of foreign exchange, issued jointly by the Director of Internal Trade and the Central Bank. Appli- cations must be approved before firm orders are placed. Schedule I consists of a list of high-priority items, including a subschedule IA of items for which licenses are automatically approved by the Director of Internal Trade, and foreign exchange is allocated by the Central Bank. Quotas are applied to items under subschedule IIB. Subschedule HAS includes high-priority items whose importation requires authorization by a state 2 Such securities must be payable in Kenya shillings and they must not be redeemable earlier than five years from the date of acquisition. 305 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution KENYA agency while subschedule IIB contains items that are domestically produced or whose substitutes are available from domestic industry, and consumer goods. Importa- tion of items in subschedules IIA and IIB is limited to importers who have been granted foreign exchange quotas. Quotas for schedule IIA are set so as to satisfy expected demand, and import licenses up to the quotas are given automatically. The importers' quotas for schedule IIB, on the other hand, are item-specific. Applications for foreign exchange allocation licenses for imports are subject to a charge of 1 percent of the cost and freight value of the application. When an exchange allocation license has been ob- tained from the Central Bank or when such a license is not required, authorized banks are permitted to provide exchange against documents, but normally not prior to customs entry. Prior exchange control approval must be obtained for imports of capital goods on deferred payment terms, and for imports of machinery and equipment, which are regarded as a contribution toward capital or are to be accounted for on a loan basis. With the exception of imports from Tanzania, Uganda, and some other countries, most imports with an f.o.b. value in excess of K Sh 40,000 are subject to preshipment inspection as to quality, quantity, and price by the Societe Generate de Surveillance (SGS) of Geneva acting for the Central Bank. A "Clean Report of Findings" must be obtained before shipment, and autho- rized banks in Kenya may not issue shipping guarantees for the clearance of imports until this "Clean Report" has been received. All goods purchased by importers in Kenya must be insured with companies licensed to transact insurance business in Kenya. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles are controlled. Authorized banks are empowered to approve specified categories of current payments without limitation or up to established limits. Amounts above these limits as well as other current payments may be approved administratively, and most current payments are in practice unrestricted. Fees for education up to the equivalent of K Sh 24,000 a person for a full scholastic year3 and fees for other specified purposes may be approved by an authorized bank upon presentation of evidence of debt. The Central Bank may approve higher remittances for education expenses. Foreign nationals who work in Kenya as employed persons (as well as certain categories of the self-employed, such as doctors and dentists) and have not been in the country for more than four years may remit abroad as savings up to one third of their monthly salaries but not more than K Sh 4,000 a month; in addition, they may remit funds to cover maintenance, educational expenses, etc., provided that their total remittances including savings do not exceed one half of 3 Authorized dealers are not allowed to remit any funds for educational support to students at primary or secondary schools who were not abroad in the 1975-76 academic year. 306 their monthly salaries. Expatriates who have stayed for over four years may continue to remit from salaries as above, up to the end of the tenth year of their residence in Kenya, but in that case they are not entitled to transfer additional savings upon emigration w i th in that period. Remittances to South Africa, other than certain pen- sions, are prohibited. Nonresident individual property owners may remit up to K Sh 20,000 of net rental income in each 12-month period. Any excess of net rent over the permitted transfer is placed in a Blocked Account and may be invested in approved securities with at least five years to maturity, after which period the redemption proceeds may be remitted to the nonresident beneficiary. Real estate companies deriving income solely from rent are per- mitted to transfer annually up to 10 percent of the book value of their properties as at September 25, 1970, or an amount not exceeding 10 percent of issued capital. Where income is derived from rent as well as other sources, applications must be made to the exchange control authorities for approval of remittance of such incomes. Exchange control approval is required for outward remittance of profits and dividends on nonresi- dent equity holdings. The basic allowance for travel by adults holding round-trip tickets is K Sh 4,000 a person (K Sh 2,000 for children between 3 and 12 years of age) every two years, which may be taken out in foreign bank notes. Holders of one-way tickets who have been granted emigration status or final departure rights are not entitled to the basic travel allowance but to an allowance of K Sh 2,000 a person. The basic allowance is not available for travel to South Africa. Commercial banks may sell foreign exchange for business travel to Tanzania and Uganda up to K Sh 400 a night for a maximum period of ten days at a time. Business travelers to other countries are granted an allowance of up to K Sh 1,000 a day for a maximum period of 20 days. There is a once-only hajj pilgrimage allowance of K Sh 12,000 for adults, which is available only to persons who have not utilized the basic travel allowance within the preceding two years. Nonresident travelers may take out foreign currency notes up to the amount they brought in upon entry. Residents of Kenya traveling abroad on international flights and holding return tickets may carry up to K Sh 100 with them for local expenses on return, but otherwise the export of Kenya bank notes is prohibited. Temporarily, all sales of tickets to Kenyan residents for nongovernmental travel outside Kenya are subject to exchange control approval. Applications for travel tickets must be accompanied by a deposit of 10 percent of the value of the air ticket and 5 percent of the sea ticket, returnable only if the applications are not approved. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. All regular exporters are registered with the Central Bank. Exports of certain foodstuffs and agricultural products require licenses and may be subject to restriction to ensure ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution adequate supplies in the domestic market. Exports of tea, coffee, minerals, precious stones, and other essential strategic materials are also subject to special licensing. Most other goods may be exported without special licenses other than exchange control approval. Coffee is marketed through the Coffee Board of Kenya. Export proceeds in foreign currencies must be collected within three months of exportation and offered to an authorized bank in Kenya for conversion into Kenya shillings. Exports of manufactured goods with at least 30 percent domestic value added are eligible for compensation equivalent to 10 percent of the f .o .b. value; exporters with annual export receipts in excess of the preceding year's performance are entitled to an additional 15 per- cent compensation on the difference in earnings between the two years. All exports other than coffee, tea, sugar, sisal, pyrethrum, horticultural products, petroleum prod- ucts, soda ash, and most goods not subject to import duty are covered by the export compensation scheme. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in foreign currencies must be sold to an authorized bank. Nonresidents must settle hotel bills in foreign currency or against an External Account. Travelers may bring in freely foreign currency notes, except those of Tanzania and Uganda. The import of domestic bank notes is prohibited, except that resi- dents returning to Kenya may bring in up to K Sh 100 previously taken out by themselves. Capital Capital transfers to all countries are restricted. Trans- fers to South Africa are prohibited. With the exception of expatriate employees who have opted for remittance of savings from salaries, an emigrant is allowed to transfer up to K Sh 300,000 a family unit from his declared assets as a settling-in allowance to the new country of resi- dence. Of this sum, K Sh 100,000 is made available for immediate remittance and the remainder will be autho- rized for remittance in not more than five annual installments not exceeding the equivalent of K Sh 40,000 each year.

All remaining funds must be credited to a Blocked Account; KENYA they may then be invested in approved securities, and redemption proceeds become transferable, provided that redemption does not take place earlier than five years from the date of purchase. If assets in Kenya are valued at K Sh 1 million or more, they must be liquidated before any exchange control approvals are sought and the proceeds must be invested in prescribed securities. The investment of foreign funds in Kenya is not generally restricted, but to ensure eventual repatriation it is necessary to obtain from the Treasury a "certificate of approved enterprise" for the investment. Foreign and domestic investment in specified types of production require approval. Local borrowing by nonresident- owned or nonresident-controlled companies, as well as borrowing by residents from nonresidents, requires exchange control approval and is restricted. All imports and exports of securities require approval. Approval is granted for the purchase by nonresidents of Kenyan securities on a recognized stock exchange, provided that payment is received in an appropriate manner. The income from such securities is remittable, but the proceeds on resale must normally be credited to a Blocked Account unless they are reinvested. Residents are not normally permitted to purchase foreign securities. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Kenya for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial and professional users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Exports of gold in any form other than jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler require exchange control approval. Import licenses for gold bullion (ingots, bars, or sheets) are issued restrictively and only to goldsmiths, and imports of gold coin are not being licensed. Changes During 1984 Imports and Import Payments July 1. The import licensing system was revised by merging subschedule IIA (ordinary) with schedule IIB; in this connection, 306 import items were transferred from subschedule IIA (ordinary) and schedule IIB to Schedule I. 307 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution KOREA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Korea is the Korean Won, which is linked to a multicurrency basket (consisting of a trade- weighted basket and the SDR basket), but other factors are also taken into account if necessary. The Bank of Korea establishes daily the exchange rate of the won in terms of the U.S. dollar, which is the intervention currency. On December 31, 1984 the buying and selling rates of the Bank of Korea for the U .S. dollar were W 825.70 and W 829.10, respectively, per US$1, and the telegraphic transfer buying and selling rates of the foreign exchange banks were W 825.30 and W 829.50, respectively, per US$1. The buying and selling rates for certain other currencies are posted daily by foreign exchange banks on the basis of buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar in markets abroad. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Foreign exchange banks may conduct forward transac- tions not only in foreign currencies but also between the Korean won and foreign currencies. There are no specific restrictions on the terms of forward contracting in respect of interbank transactions. In forward contracts between the Korean won and foreign currencies, the terms of forward contracts between a foreign exchange bank and a nonbank customer cannot exceed one year. In addition, a forward contract between a foreign exchange bank and a nonbank resident customer must be related to a bona fide transaction and the contract amount must not exceed the expected receipt or payment on the transaction. Administration of Control The Ministry of Finance initiates policy with respect to prescription of currency and method of settlement, foreign exchange operations, payments for nonmerchan- dise transactions, and capital transactions and transfers. It also prepares and administers the Foreign Exchange Supply and Demand Plan, which sets overall ceilings on the amounts of foreign exchange that may be used. The Bank of Korea, as the Government's agent, executes most of the above functions; it also regulates operations in the exchange market and is authorized to intervene in it. The Bank has been delegated authority to control payments related to invisibles and certain capital transac- tions. The foreign exchange banks, as well as the branch offices in Korea of foreign banks, are authorized to engage in commercial international banking and in all foreign exchange dealings, with the exception of those specifically prohibited. The trade program for imports financed from Korea's own foreign exchange resources (KFX) is prepared by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Imports financed by foreign loans are drawn up separately by the 308 Ministry of Finance in consultation w i th the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Import licenses are issued by the foreign exchange banks. Prescription of Currency All settlements between Korea and other countries are made in convertible currencies. The proceeds of exports must be obtained in prescribed currencies.1 Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents, including Korean workers abroad, may maintain foreign currency deposit accounts with foreign exchange banks. Remittances from such accounts and withdrawals in the form of currency notes upon depar- ture from Korea may, in general, be made freely. The approval of the bank where the account is held is not required for remittances abroad or transfer to other foreign currency accounts, for withdrawals of foreign means of payment and purchases of other foreign means of payment, or for sales to a foreign exchange bank in exchange for domestic means of payment or payments for approved transactions. The deposit may be disposed of by sale to a foreign exchange bank at the prevailing exchange rate and may be debited for salaries paid to foreign employees. All residents are allowed to open foreign currency deposit accounts. The holders of these accounts may change the currency composition of these accounts as they wish. Imports and Import Payments All imports require licenses; for certain imports (see below), licenses are issued upon application. Imports are divided into two categories: those paid for with Korean foreign exchange (KFX imports) and those paid for with foreign loan funds. KFX imports are classified as automatic approval or restricted items. All commodities may be imported freely (i.e., applications for import licenses are automatically approved), unless they are on a list of restricted items, subject to the general limits set by the Foreign Exchange Supply and Demand Plan. On December 31, 1984, out of 7,915 basic items in the Customs Cooperation Council Nomenclature (CCCN), 1,216 were classified as restricted items. Imports of raw materials for the production of exports are normally approved automatically, irrespective of their classifica- tion. Import licenses are granted only to registered traders; to maintain the status of a registered trader, a minimum value of US$0.5 million of exports is required each year for ordinary exporters. 1 In addition to the Hong Kong dollar and the Swiss franc, the list of prescribed currencies comprises the currencies of the member countries of the IMF that have accepted the obligations of Article VIII of the Fund's Articles of Agreement. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution The commercial terms of payment on which imports may be contracted are regulated. The requirement for advance import deposits ranging from 5 percent to 20 percent for goods imported by the private sector on a deferred payment basis has been suspended with the reduction of the percentage to zero beginning in Febru- ary 1982. The customs tariff is a "flexible" tariff. Furthermore, the Government may alter import duty rates administra- tively by up to 40 percentage points.2 The Government also has authority to impose import surcharges of up to 30 percent on all dutiable imports, but by the end of 1984 it had not invoked this authority. A defense surcharge of 2.5 percent ad valorem is levied on most goods, whether locally produced or imported. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require individual licenses. Payments for invisibles connected with foreign trade and for certain other items such as banking charges, insurance premiums, communication fees, and periodicals are licensed automatically. In addition, Ko- rean companies are authorized to use foreign exchange for the expenses of their overseas branches. Residents traveling abroad may purchase foreign exchange up to the equivalent of US$3,000 each trip as the basic travel allowance plus US$200 a day (if the period of travel is in excess of 10 days), or up to US$2,000 as a monthly allowance for living expenses (if the period of travel is in excess of 60 days), and may also purchase additional foreign exchange for extra expenses. The basic individual travel allowance for students is US$2,000; for others, including Koreans working abroad, it is US$1,000. Korean currency notes in excess of W 500,000 and foreign currency notes may not be exported without special permission. Nonresidents must register the foreign exchange that they bring into Korea if the amount exceeds the equivalent of US$5,000. Upon leaving the country, foreign residents and tourists may acquire foreign exchange up to the amount for which they have proof of exchange. Exports and Export Proceeds Certain exports on a restricted list require individual licenses. All other exports may be made freely under an automatic approval procedure. Foreign exchange pro- ceeds from exports must either be surrendered to a foreign exchange bank at its posted customer rate or be deposited in foreign exchange accounts in banks. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds derived from invisibles must either be sold to a foreign exchange bank for won or be deposited in 2 Under an announcement made by the Ministry of Finance on December 31, 1984, "emergency tariffs" (chargeable on certain import items expected to inflict a damage on existing or new domestic industries) and "adjustment tariffs" (i.e., those leviable on imports expected to rise too rapidly) on 10 items were to be abolished from January to June 1985, leaving 14 items under these special tariffs (5 under the emergency tariffs and 9 under the adjustment tariffs). KOREA foreign exchange accounts in the banks. Travelers may bring with them any amount of foreign exchange, but the import by travelers of Korean currency in excess of W 500,000 is restricted. The proceeds received by construction companies from construction activity abroad must be deposited in foreign currency accounts, and the conversion of these deposits is subject to approval by a foreign exchange bank, for ascertaining the bona fides of the transactions; approval is given virtually automatically. Capital All capital remittances require approval. Foreign capital investment, loans from abroad, and imports of capital goods on a long-term basis can secure a guarantee of repayment and repatriation under the Foreign Capital Inducement Act. No limits are placed on the conversion and remittance of legitimate profits and dividends, or on the repatriation of the originally invested capital. No prior approval is required to hold abroad retained profits not exceeding US$10,000 from Korean direct invest- ment overseas. Under the Foreign Capital Inducement Act, authorization is required for borrowing abroad of more than US$1 million with maturities in excess of three years; for borrowings under US$1 million repay- able within three years, authorization is required under the Foreign Exchange Control Act. There is a limit of US$100,000 on individual borrowings from foreign branches of Korean banks by Koreans living abroad. Foreign bank branches in Korea can enter into swap transactions with the Bank of Korea to secure funds for their domestic currency lending. Foreign exchange al- lowance for emigrants is subject to a limit of US$100,000 for each household. Foreign exchange banks may grant authorization for such remittances up to US$20,000; for remittances over US$20,000 authoriza- tion from the Bank of Korea is required. There is a list of industries in which investment is reserved for Koreans. For foreign investment in other industries, automatic approval is granted in principle if equity participation is less than 50 percent or US$1 mill- ion for a single project; participation in excess of 50 per- cent is approved after consultation among related minis- tries. Foreign equity participation of up to 100 percent is permissible under the Act. Gold Certain commemorative gold coins are legal tender but do not circulate. Residents may freely buy, hold, and sell gold in any form in Korea. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler require licenses issued by the Bank of Korea or a foreign exchange bank; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users. The import of gold for industrial or medical purposes requires approval by a 309 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution KOREA foreign exchange bank. Domestically produced gold may be disposed of in the free market. The free market price at public gold auctions was about W 9,967 a gram at the end of 1984. Changes During 1984 Imports and Import Payments February 28. Changes were made in the import system as follows: (a) import restrictions were lifted on 318 items, with effect from July 1; (b) it was decided that henceforth the annual list of import items to be freed from restrictions would be announced two or three years in advance, so as to enable domestic manufacturers to prepare for increased foreign competition; in this con- nection, advanced notice was given of 546 items to be freed in 1985-86. The object of policy was to reduce the share of restricted items to below 5 percent of imports by 1988. March 20. In a tightening of the guidelines for the introduction of foreign trademarks on goods produced and sold in Korea, it was announced that the Ministry of Commerce and Industry would no longer approve the introduction of foreign brands not accompanied by the transfer of the related technologies. In addition, the export obligation ratio was raised from 25 percent to 30 percent for textile products with foreign brands, from 30 percent to 35 percent for leather sport shoes, and from 25 percent to 30 percent for electric appliances. May 24. Nine items were added to the list of goods to be freed of import restrictions as of July 1, bringing the total number of import items to be liberalized to 358 in 1984. June 16. Effective July 1, the number of items subject to "emergency tariff was reduced from 38 to 23; a total of 29 items were removed from the list, while 14 items were added, including 11 items for which import restrictions were lifted as of that date. The measure was adopted to assist local manufacturers unable to compete with foreign producers. July 1. The maximum period for import payments on a deferred basis was shortened from 120 to 90 days. Exports and Export Proceeds May 27. Authorization was granted for herring roe, frozen mushrooms, crude oil, kerosene, gasoline, pro- pane and butane gas, a lum inum ingots, and amplifiers to be exported freely. Capital April 20. In a liberalization of the rules under which foreign bank branches could operate in Korea, the Ministry of Finance announced that henceforth foreign banks would be allowed to join the National Bankers' Association. In addition, foreign bank branches were permitted to apply a higher gearing ratio to their capital base in order to expand their lending activities. Begin- ning in 1985, foreign bank branches would be given access to the rediscount facilities of the Central Bank on the same terms as domestic banks, for export financing; and from 1986, the rediscount facility would be fu l ly available to foreign banks on the same basis as applied to domestic banks. July 1. A revised Foreign Capital Inducement Act came into effect. The law expands the areas for foreign investment by introducing a "negative list system" under which only those industries closed to foreign investment were specified, including postal, piped water, sewage, cigarette, casino, telephone and telegraphic, railroad, ginseng, printed news media, and radio and television businesses. Automatic approval would henceforth be granted, in principle, for foreign equity participation amounting to less than 50 percent of total or US$ 1 mil- lion for a single project; equity participation greater than 50 percent would be approved after consultation among the related ministries. Foreign equity participation of up to 100 percent would be permitted under the new law. December 28. The Ministry of Finance announced detailed rules guiding the approval of foreign investment in sectors reserved for "restricted projects." The rules specified, inter alia, that foreign investment would be permitted in 19 additional manufacturing industries and in foreign trade for projects meeting specified criteria, including the formation of a joint venture with existing local firms in some cases and prior registration with the Ministry of Trade and Industry in others. 310 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution KUWAIT (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Kuwait is the Kuwaiti Dinar. The exchange value of the Kuwaiti dinar is determined on the basis of the fixed but adjustable relationship between the Kuwaiti dinar and a weighted basket of currencies of Kuwa i t's major trading partners. Following a period between April and August 1984 when two exchange rates (a "declared rate" for documented commercial transactions, and a more depreciated "financial rate" for capital and specified current transactions) were applied, a unitary exchange rate system was in place by the end of 1984. For exchange transactions with local banks in the intervention currency, the U .S. dollar, the Central Bank of Kuwait normally sets margins of 0.0625 percent on either side of the middle rate. The Central Bank sets the rate for the U.S. dollar each day on the basis of the latest available market quotations for that currency in relation to the other currencies included in the basket. On December 31, 1984 the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were KD 0.30427 and KD 0.30465, respec- tively, per US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. On April 5, 1963, Kuwait formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2 , 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control There is no exchange control, and residents and nonresidents may freely purchase and sell foreign cur- rencies in Kuwait. Dealings in the currencies of Israel and South Africa are prohibited. * General and individual import licenses are issued by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. A limited control over exports is adminis- tered by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Customs and Ports Administration. Prescription of Currency There are no prescription of currency requirements. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents may freely open accounts in Kuwaiti dinars and foreign currencies. The use of such accounts is not restricted. Imports and Import Payments Import licenses are required for all commercial im- ports other than fresh fruit and vegetables; licenses, except for wheat, flour, and asbestos pipes, are issued freely to registered Kuwaiti merchants and companies. Registered importers handling a variety of commodities may obtain a general license valid for one year. Other 1 In addition, all imports from these countries and all exports to them are prohibited; payments may not be made to them or be received from them for any type of transaction. importers must obtain specific licenses for individual commodities, which also are valid for one year. Imports of industrial equipment, machinery, and their spare parts require industrial licenses, valid for one-time use. Licenses are issued to registered and licensed industrial establishments after the approval of the Industrial Devel- opment Commission at the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Private imports of personal objects may be permitted under individual or specific licenses. Importa- tion of certain items (mainly oxygen, certain steel and asbestos pipes, pork or foodstuffs containing pork, alcoholic beverages, and used vehicles over five years old) is prohibited. Commercial imports are limited to registered import- ers. To be registered, the importer must be either a Kuwaiti citizen or a firm in which all partners are Kuwaiti nationals, or a shareholding or limited liability company in which Kuwaiti nationals own at least 51 per- cent of the stock. Imports from any permitted source may be paid for freely. During 1984, customs tariffs continued to be used for the protection of domestically produced goods; in this context, a customs duty of 30 percent is applied on lubricating oil imports which are considered similar to those produced domestically, and a maximum customs duty of 100 percent is imposed on a few commodities competing with locally manufactured goods. Imports are subject to customs duty at a minimum rate of 4 percent. Imports of foodstuffs are exempt from import duties. Beginning from September 1, 1983, and in conceit with other member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) (Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) import duties in Kuwait have been stabilized at the prevailing rate of 4 percent. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of live sheep and poultry and of certain other items (such as sugar, fats, rice, meat, eggs, milk, cheese, butter, olive oil, fresh fru i ts, vegetables in any form, beans, lentils, chick-peas, jams, and cement) may be prohibited in time of emergency or shortage in Kuwait. These items may be exported in limited quan- tities only, under a special license issued by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Exports of arms and ammu- nition require licenses. Licenses are not required for other exports or re-exports. There are no requirements attached to receipts from exports or re-exports; the proceeds need not be repatriated or surrendered, and they may be disposed of freely, regardless of the currency involved. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles All payments for current invisibles may be made freely. Travelers may bring in or take out any amount in Kuwaiti or other bank notes. 3 11 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution KUWAIT Capital There are no exchange control restraints on the transfer to Kuwait of resident or nonresident capital in any currency. Government agreement is necessary for the participation of nonresident capital in corporations in Kuwait; at least 51 percent of ownership of new Kuwaiti companies must be held by nationals. Beginning from 1983, the participation of the nationals of countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council in companies established in Kuwait may reach up to 75 percent of the capital. No restrictions are imposed on outward capital payments by residents or nonresidents. Dealings in the stocks of foreign companies in the official Kuwait stock exchange are prohibited, and foreigners may not buy or sell stocks at this exchange. Gold The monetary authorities and merchants registered with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry may import and export gold in any form, provided that such gold is not less than 18-karat fine; gold jewelry may not be imported or sold unless it is properly hallmarked. Kuwaiti nationals may freely, and without license, purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad. Other residents may, on arrival or departure, carry their holdings of gold in any form, without restriction or license. Jewelry and precious metals in any form, manufactured or unmanufactured, are subject to an import duty of 4 percent. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement April 9. A two-tier exchange rate system was in- troduced as a temporary measure, under which foreign exchange was to be provided for documented commer- cial transactions at the declared rate, while a more depreciated rate (the financial rate) was to apply to capital and specified current transactions. (By July 1984, the Central Bank began intervening in the exchange market, and by August 1984, the financial rate had been brought to parity with the declared rate; previously the margin between the two rates had never exceeded 2 per- cent.) Imports and Import Payments August 13. A 30 percent customs duty was introduced as a protective tariff on imports of lubricating oils considered to be similar to those produced domestically. 312 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Lao People's Democratic Re- public is the Kip (KN), which was introduced by decree on December 10, 1979 to replace the Kip of Liberation at KN 1 = KL 100. On December 31, 1984 the official exchange rate for the U.S. dollar quoted by the National Bank of Laos (the central bank) was KN 10 = US$1; this rate is used for customs valuation purposes only. With the exception noted below, foreign exchange transactions are effected at a premium exchange rate of KN 34.65 per US$1. The Lao Bank for Foreign Trade applies a preferential exchange rate for its foreign exchange purchases from the private sector and to inward private transfers. Buying and selling rates for certain other currenciesl are also officially quoted, based on the preferential exchange rate. Administration of Control The Lao Bank for Foreign Trade, a subsidiary of the National Bank, handles all official foreign exchange transactions related to foreign trade and services. All other official transactions are handled by the National Bank, which also administers exchange controls. Most foreign trade has been nationalized and applications for imports through official channels must be approved by the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Finance. Private merchants holding business licenses may, how- ever, import and export basic goods under the control of the Foreign Trade Department. The Societe du Commerce Lao (SCL) carries out the actual trade transactions and collects a commission of 2 percent of the c . i . f. value of each export or import transaction. The SCL directly distributes the imported commodities and pays the import taxes. It values merchandise received under foreign aid at the domestic sale price of the product; import taxes on aid imports are levied on 80 percent of this price. Prescription of Currency No prescription of currency requirement is imposed on receipts or payments but, in principle, the National Bank provides and accepts only deutsche mark, French francs, Japanese yen, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, and U .S. dollars. The Lao People's Democratic Republic has bilateral trading arrangements covering all commodity trade with Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Demo- cratic Republic, Hungary, the U .S .S .R ., and Viet Nam. The bilateral trading arrangements are for a period of five years and are implemented through annual pro- tocols, with annual limits on the deficits which Laos can incur for transactions with the partner countries; the deficits are in principle to be settled by means of trade 1 Deutsche mark, French francs, Japanese yen, pounds sterling, and Swiss francs. transactions within six months from the end of the year of occurrence of the deficit; in some cases, however, such deficits may be converted into long-term loans. Imports and Import Payments The SCL has the monopoly on imports of investment goods, industrial inputs, and basic consumer goods. An annual import plan is formulated by the Department of Foreign Trade in the Ministry of Commerce, based on requests furnished by each government ministry, pro- vince, and state enterprise. In general, priority is given to the import of spare parts, raw materials, machinery, and basic commodities, including rice. The import program is reviewed and revised every three months during the fiscal year. An allocation of foreign exchange to a state enterprise lapses at the end of the year if it is not utilized; state enterprises may modify their import requirements during the year, subject to the approval of the Planning Committee. State enterprises must transfer their export earnings to the National Bank, but once an enterprise has met its planned target for foreign exchange earnings, it may keep 50 percent of additional earnings in a special account at the National Bank; funds in such special accounts can then be used by the enterprise to import machinery and spare parts, as well as to cover certain prescribed operational expenses in foreign ex- change. These amounts are not included in the annual import plan. A similar provision holds for provincial governments. The SCL has a monopoly on exports of timber, rice, mineral ore, coffee, cardamom, and stick lac. Individuals are allowed to export and import commodities outside SCL monopoly provided that they submit a quarterly foreign trade plan specifying the way in which their imports will be financed. Settlement for imports must be channeled through the Lao Bank for Foreign Trade. Payments for Invisibles There is a foreign exchange budget detailing the Government's payments in foreign exchange during the fiscal year. Payments for all other invisibles are subject to prior authorization by the Ministry of Finance. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of gold and silver are prohibited, except when made by or on behalf of the monetary authorities. Export taxes are levied at rates ranging between 3 percent and 40 percent, depending on the commodity. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles must be surrendered to the National Bank.

Not for Redistribution LEBANON (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Lebanon is the Lebanese Pound. The authorities do not maintain margins in respect of ex- change transactions, and exchange rates are determined largely on the basis of demand and supply conditions in the exchange market. However, the authorities intervene when necessary in order to maintain orderly conditions in the exchange market. On December 31, 1984 the rate for the U.S. dollar was LL 8.89 per US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. The calculation of duties and taxes on goods and services for a given month on amounts invoiced or expressed in foreign currencies is based on the middle rate of those currencies during the previous month. For December 1984 the rate was LL 7.62 per US$1. Prescription of Currency No restrictions are imposed on exchange payments abroad or receipts in Lebanon. Some transactions with Poland, with which Lebanon has a bilateral payments agreement, may be made through specific accounts denominated in U.S. dollars. Imports and Import Payments Imports of a few goods (mainly arms and ammunition, narcotics, and similar products) are either prohibited or reserved for the Government. All imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Imports of wheat and wheat derivatives, as well as of certain agricultural products that are produced locally, are either prohibited year-round or during a specified period of the year. Imports prohibited year-round include wheat, which, in principle, may be imported only by the Government, and citrus fru i ts, apples, olives (excluding olives in cans weighing less than 2 kilograms), olive oil, and peanuts; imports prohibited at certain times include squash, eggplant, green beans, watermelons, peas, peaches, and apricots. Imports of certain other agricultural products and all seeds require a license. Import licenses are also required for certain finished goods, sanitary ceramic wares, and electric and telephone wires and cables made of copper. All other commodities may be imported freely without a license. Exchange to pay for imports may be obtained freely. Banks are obliged to ensure that import- ers are in possession of a valid import license, if required, before issuing letters of credit. A municipalities tax of 3.5 percent is levied on the value of all goods imported, except those originating in an Arab country. A stamp tax is applicable to all imports, except gold and bank notes, at the following rates: LL 2 per mill for import values up to LL 100,000, LL 1.5 per mill for import values between LL 100,000 and LL 400,000, and LL 1 per mill for import values exceeding LL 400,000. A surcharge of 10 percent of the applicable import duty is levied on specified textiles and garments. Surcharges are also levied on motor vehicles, jewelry, watches, and alcoholic beverages. The rates of surcharge on motor vehicles, based on weight, are 20 piastres a kilogram up to 1,500 kilograms; 30 piastres a kilogram between 1,500 kilograms and 2,000 kilo- grams; and 40 piastres a kilogram over 2,000 kilograms. The rate of surcharge on watches and jewelry is 5 per- cent, and that on alcoholic beverages is LL 4 a liter, or LL 145 for a case of whiskey containing 12 bottles. Payments for Invisibles There are no restrictions on payments for invisibles. Exchange may be obtained through the free market. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of certain goods (mainly arms and ammu- nition, narcotics, and similar products) to any destination and all exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Exports of wheat and its derivatives, to any country, and all exports to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea require a license. Exchange receipts from exports may be retained, used, or sold in the free market. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles may be retained, used, or sold in the free market. Capital There are no limitations on capital payments or receipts. Exchange may be obtained or sold through the free market. Banks are permitted to pay interest on nonresident-held deposits denominated in Lebanese pounds. Bank credit in Lebanese pounds to residents for the purchase of foreign exchange for purposes other than foreign trade transactions is subject to a special reserve requirement; the required reserve amounts to 40 percent of Lebanese pound loans that directly give rise to foreign currency deposits and 15 percent of foreign currency deposits directly arising from Lebanese pound loans to depositors. Banks are authorized to maintain net foreign currency positions up to 15 percent of the amount of their own capital. Under a "free zone" banking facility, the commercial banks are exempt from reserve requirements and fees for deposit insurance in respect of foreign currency deposits. Nonresidents are exempt from the 10 percent tax on interest earnings from foreign currency deposits. Under a National Investment Insurance Scheme, new foreign investments are insured against losses arising from noncivil risks, including war. Compensation is paid on losses exceeding 5 percent of the insured value. Gold Residents may freely hold gold in any form at home or abroad and may freely negotiate gold in any form w i th residents and nonresidents at home or abroad. Imports 315 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution LEBANON and exports of gold in any form are freely permitted and do not require a license but must be officially recorded.

The principal interven- tion currency is the U.S. dollar. On December 31, 1984 the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were US$0.5060 and US$0.5050, respectively, per M 1. Subject to certain limitations, authorized dealers are permitted to conduct forward exchange operations. The South African Reserve Bank provides forward cover; for private sector transactions such cover is given to autho- rized dealers based on the middle spot rate adjusted by a percentage factor announced from time to time. The South African rand is also legal tender in Lesotho. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Exchange Control Territory Lesotho forms part of the Rand Monetary Area, which is an exchange control territory comprising Lesotho, South Africa, and Swaziland. No restrictions are applied to payments within the Rand Monetary Area; these are uncontrolled and unrecorded. In relation to countries outside the Rand Monetary Area, Lesotho applies ex- change controls that are largely similar to those of South Africa and Swaziland. Administration of Control The Central Bank of Lesotho controls external cur- rency transactions. Authority to approve certain types of current payments is delegated to commercial banks up to established limits. Lesotho's trade licensing arrange- ments are designed mainly to raise revenue and to prevent tax evasion; permits are issued by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Licenses for financial institu- tions and insurance agents are issued by the Central Bank of Lesotho. Imports and Import Payments Lesotho is a member of a customs union with Botswana, South Africa, and Swaziland, and there are no restrictions on imports originating in any country of the customs union. Imports from countries outside the customs union are usually licensed in conformity with South Africa's import regulations; Lesotho reserves the right to restrict certain imports. Import permits are valid for all countries and entitle the holder to buy the foreign exchange required to make the import payment upon customs entry. There are no bilateral payments arrangements. Exports and Export Proceeds Certain exports are subject to licensing for revenue purposes; this requirement, in practice, is restricted to the export of diamonds. Most exports are shipped without license to or through South Africa. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments to nonresidents for current transactions, although subject to control, are not normally restricted. Authority to approve some types of current payments has been delegated to authorized dealers up to established limits, such as the basic exchange allowance for tourist travel (the equivalent of M 6,000 in a calendar year for an adult and M 3,000 for a child) and a smaller annual allocation for travel to neighboring countries. The allowance for business travel is M 10,000 in a calendar year. Capital Applications for outward transfers of capital are considered on their merits. The rulings on applications for inward and outward capital transfers may depend on whether the applicant is a temporarily resident foreign national, a nonresident, or a resident. Certain tax incentives for inward direct investment are provided to manufacturing undertakings approved by a Pioneer Industries Board under the Pioneer Industries Encour- agement Act, 1969. The free transfer of income from an emigrant's blocked assets is limited to an annual max- imum of M 100,000 a family unit. An emigrant family or an individual may export one automobile only, with a maximum value of M 20,000, provided the automobile was purchased at least one year prior to emigration. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell any gold coin that is legal tender. Changes During 1984 Imports and Import Payments July 1. Lesotho formally became a member of the Preferential Trade Area of Eastern and Southern African States. 317 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution LIBERIA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Liberia is the Liberian Dollar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar at $1 = US$1. There is no official intervention. U.S. currency is legal tender in Liberia and circulates along with Liberian coinage. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Prescription of Currency No prescription of currency requirements are in force. Settlements with the Central Bank of West African States (for Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Niger, Senegal, and Togo) and The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are normally made through the West African Clearing House. Imports and Import Payments There is no general system of import control, but the importation of some items is subject to licensing and quantitative restrictions by the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Transportation and the National Invest- ment Commission to protect local industry. These items comprise automobile batteries, biscuits, brooms and brushes, crown corks, exercise books and note pads, insecticides, kitchen towels, roofing nails, paint, paper napkins, sugar, toilet tissues, and wheelbarrows. A few items (e.g., arms and ammunition, explosives, used clothing, and Pharmaceuticals) require prior licenses. Imports of rice, rubber footwear, household candles, safety matches, and powdered detergents have been suspended temporarily. In addition, imports of certain goods (e.g., pornographic literature and narcotics other than for medicinal purposes) and all imports from South Africa are prohibited. Petroleum is imported only by the Liberia Petroleum Refining Company, and by the mining and rubber companies for their own use; a private company is the sole distributor of aviation fue l. present required for precious metals, precious stones, elephant tusks and ivory, wild animals, cement, agricul- tural products other than rubber, flour, and sugar, and certain other items, such as arms and ammunition and explosives. Licenses are generally issued freely, and no licenses are required for direct exports by foreign concession holders; licenses serve mainly to enforce taxation or, for agricultural products, to assure certifica- tion of quality and origin and to safeguard the export monopoly of the Liberia Produce Marketing Corpora- tion. The surrender of export proceeds is not required, and exchange receipts are freely disposable. An export tax is levied on diamonds. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles There are no limitations on payments for or receipts from invisibles. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or payments by residents or nonresidents. Under an Investment Incentive Code of 1966 (as amended in 1973), enterprises undertaking new invest- ment projects may be granted a five-year, 90 percent duty exemption on imports of raw materials and ma- chinery, total tax exemption on reinvested profits, a 50 percent exemption on distributable profits, and a protective tariff on competing imported products. The five-year incentive may be renewed for a further two years in certain circumstances. Gold Residents may freely and without license purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form are subject to licenses issued by the Minister of Lands and Mines; import licenses are issued freely but export licenses are granted restrictively. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to South Africa are prohibited. Exports of rice have been temporarily suspended. Export licenses are at Changes During 1984 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 318 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SOCIALIST PEOPLE'S LIBYAN ARAB JAMAHIRIYA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya is the Libyan Dinar. The middle rate for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is LD 0.296053 = US$1. The Central Bank of Libya publishes daily buying and selling rates for 17 curren- cies.1 It deals with commercial banks only in pounds sterling and U.S. dollars, at rates fixed daily. The commercial banks are permitted to buy or sell other currencies against pounds sterling and U.S. dollars through their foreign correspondents. The banks may not deal among themselves in foreign currencies. Neither authorized banks nor importers or exporters are allowed to enter into forward commitments in foreign currencies. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Central Bank, which has delegated some of its powers to the authorized banks. Policy relating to imports and exports is deter- . mined by the Popular Congresses and executed by the General People's Committee for the Economy and Light Industry. Prescription of Currency Settlements with other countries are made in convert- ible currencies, usually U .S. dollars or pounds sterling. All settlements with Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts A nonresident, as defined by the Central Bank, who is gainfully employed in the country is permitted under the exchange control regulations to open and maintain a nonresident account in Libyan dinars with any autho- rized bank. Legitimate earnings of such nonresidents can be credited to their nonresident accounts. Similarly, authorized banks have authority to credit interest earned on savings balances in these nonresident accounts. All other credits to nonresident accounts require the prior approval of the Central Bank. (For debits on such accounts, see section on Payments for Invisibles, below.) Funds brought in by nonresident contractors undertak- ing contracts in their own names are required to be kept with an authorized bank. Payments received by contrac- tors in respect of their contracts may also be credited to these accounts. Remittances from these accounts are subject to the prior approval of the Central Bank after 'Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Lebanese pounds, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Saudi Arabian riyals, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, Tunisian dinars, and U .S. dollars. submission of the prescribed evidence but, in general, remittance is permitted up to the net of the tax amount specified in the contract. Nonresident-owned capital that is not permitted to be transferred abroad is credited to blocked accounts. With the approval of the Central Bank, funds in blocked accounts (with certain exceptions) may be used for expenditures in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya up to LD 500 a year to cover the cost of visits by the owner of the funds or a close relative; for payment of legal fees, taxes, etc.; for remittances to the owner of the funds in his country of permanent residence (up to LD 1,000 in a calendar year); and for remittances in cases of hardship. When the funds have been in a blocked account for five years, they qua l ify, upon payment of due taxes, for remittance in fu ll to the owner in his country of permanent residence. The blocked accounts of persons (with certain exceptions) who have left the country permanently are being released in installments; balances credited prior to March 31, 1966 have been released. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Israel and South Africa are pro- hibited. Imports included in the annual Commodity Budget are undertaken exclusively by state-owned enter- prises without license. Importers are required to deal directly with producers abroad and not through inter- mediaries. However, imports not included in the Com- modity Budget are subject to licensing. Resident and nonresident firms undertaking development projects may import needed items which are not included in the annual Commodity Budget and not available locally. There is a prohibited import list, consisting mainly of consumer and luxury goods.2 Only government agencies may act as commercial agents, including import agents, for foreign companies. A state-owned company con- trolled by the Central Bank has a monopoly over the import of gold and precious metals. With certain exceptions, all exchange permits require central bank approval. Exchange permits required for imports are readily granted by the authorized banks following central bank approval, provided that there is a firm contract and an import license has been obtained from the Secretariat of Economy and, if the import is to be made on a letter of credit basis, that a marine insurance policy from a local insurance company is submitted before the letter of credit is established. However, no letter of credit in respect of the import of consumer durable goods may be opened by an authorized bank without obtaining a required cash margin based on the import price. Importers must present to the bank 2These include mineral water, fru it juices, instant tea, certain types of coffee, green vegetables, pou l try, preserved meats and vegetables, alcoholic beverages, peanuts, fresh f r u i t, oriental rugs, soaps, envelopes, crystal chandeliers, toy guns, luxu ry cars, and fu r s. 319 ©International Monetary Fund.

Payments for Invisibles The authorized banks are empowered to approve allocations for travel as indicated below. Remittances from nonresident accounts maintained by nonresident workers and technicians may be approved by authorized banks up to limits specified below: (a) nonresidents employed by the state, state-owned enterprises, and foreign companies may remit up to 50 percent of their net salaries each month if their contracts do not specify that lodging, board, or both will be made available free of charge by the employer, or up to 75 percent of net salary if their contracts specify that both lodging and board at work sites in remote areas will be made available free of charge by the employer in accordance with applicable Libyan laws and regulations; and (b) nonresidents employed by the Libyan private sector may remit up to 50 percent of their net salaries, provided that the monthly net remittance does not exceed LD 40 for agricultural and unskilled workers, and LD 60 for technical workers. Banks may issue traveler's checks and foreign currency notes to nonresident workers and technicians within the limits mentioned. All other pay- ments for invisibles, as well as payments in excess of the approval authority delegated to the banks, require prior approval from the Central Bank. Applications are con- sidered on their merits. Residents leaving for personal travel abroad, includ- ing tourist travel, may, in addition, take out foreign exchange in the form of foreign currency notes, travel- 'er's checks, and letters of credit not exceeding a total value of LD 300 (LD 150 for children under 12) in a calendar year as a basic travel allowance; the exchange may be obtained from any authorized bank in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. Additional amounts may be granted in special circumstances. Pilgrims are entitled to a special quota. Temporary residents may take out any traveler's checks or foreign currency notes which they had prev- iously brought in and declared to the customs. Exports and Export Proceeds Export licenses are required only for fish, raw wool, hides and skins, and agricultural products. .Export proceeds must be received through an authorized bank within six months of shipment. Exports of nonmonetary gold (other than for processing abroad), vegetable oils, and scrap metals are prohibited; exports or re-exports of wheat, wheat flour, crushed wheat, barley, rice, tea, sugar, tomato paste, and macaroni, which are subsidized commodities, are also prohibited. All exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. 320 Proceeds from Invisibles All foreign exchange receipts must be surrendered. Traveler's checks or foreign currency notes may be encashed only at an authorized bank or at an exchange office licensed by the Central Bank. Travelers entering the country may bring with them traveler's checks, letters of credit, securities, coupons, and other negotiable instruments in unlimited amounts. Capital Under the provisions of Foreign Capital Investment Law No. 37 of July 31, 1968, foreign capital invested in projects deemed to contribute to the economic devel- opment of the country, as well as profits thereon, may be transferred freely to the country of origin, provided that the paid-up capital is not less than LD 200,000 and that at least 51 percent of the shares are held by foreign nationals. Salaries of foreign staff employed on such projects may be transferred on the basis described above in the section under Payments for Invisibles. Central bank approval is required and customarily granted freely for all such transfers. Foreign participation in industrial ventures set up after March 2:0, 1970 is permitted on a minority basis, but only if it leads to increased produc- tion in excess of local requirements, introduction of the latest technology, and cooperation with foreign firms in exporting the surplus production. Insurance companies and foreign shareholdings in banks have been nationalized. Commercial firms have been Libyanized in varying degrees, and 51 percent or more of the Libyan interests of the international oil companies have been nationalized. Real estate may be owned in Libya only by Libyans. Nonresident-owned capital that is not permitted to be transferred abroad is credited to blocked accounts (see section on Nonresident Accounts, above). Residents require the prior approval of the Central Bank to borrow funds abroad. As a rule, residents must have prior permission from the Secretariat of the Economy and Light Industry to purchase real estate abroad or to invest abroad in securities. The investment of national capital abroad is governed by Law No. 25 of April 20, 1973. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form other than bars. The Central Bank imports processed and unprocessed gold and precious metals; it also sells gold in bars to domestic goldsmiths for manufacture at prices announced from time to time. The gold is processed before it may be sold to the public. Unworked gold is subject to an import duty of 15 percent. Changes During 1984 Administration of Control March 27.

Not for Redistribution MADAGASCAR (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement1 The currency of Madagascar is the Malagasy Franc. The Malagasy franc is pegged to a basket of several currencies. The weight assigned to each currency in the basket is based on the distribution of Madagascar's trade during 1973-80. There is no single intervention cur- rency, although the majority of transactions take place in French francs and U .S. dollars. In accordance with the movement in the basket, the Central Bank of Madagas- car adjusts the Malagasy franc exchange rates on a daily basis against ten currencies2 which it quotes. The authorized banks are not permitted to maintain an exchange position in any foreign currency although they may hold trade bills as foreign assets. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. On December 29, 1984 the midpoint rate for the U.S. dollar quoted by the Central Bank of Madagascar was FMG 658.02 = US$1. Administration of Control All countries other than Madagascar are considered foreign countries, and financial relations with all foreign countries are subject to exchange control. Exchange control is administered by the Exchange Control Office of the Directorate of the Treasury, which also supervises borrowing and lending abroad by residents, the issue, sale, or introduction of foreign securities in Madagascar, all outward investments, and inward direct investment. Some of the approval authority for exchange control has been delegated to authorized intermediaries, and all exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through such intermediaries. Import licenses are issued by the Directorate of Imports in the Ministry of Commerce. Export authorizations are issued either by that Directorate or by other specified public agencies. Prescription of Currency Payments and receipts must be effected through the authorized intermediaries which may deal with the Central Bank only in French francs or in the other quoted currencies. Nonresident Accounts The principal type of nonresident account is the Foreign Account in Malagasy Francs.

Imports and Import Payments Importers require the approval of the Ministry of Commerce before they are permitted to engage in import activities. All imports are subject to an annual import program the overall value of which is determined by the Ministry of Finance and Economy, the Ministries of Commerce and Industry, and the Central Bank. The Ministry of Commerce allocates quotas to importers within the overall limit of the import program, and licenses are issued freely up to the limits of those quotas. There are two categories of quotas: those open to merchants and those open to industrial enterprises and other importers who are final users of the product. The import of certain items, including alcoholic beverages, rice, wheat flour, vegetable oils, and cement, is reserved for the Regie Malgache des Monopoles Fiscaux and the government-owned trading firm, SINPA. All import transactions valued at FMG 10,000 or more must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Central bank authorization for each transaction is represented by a certificate, issued by the commercial bank concerned, which is required to clear the merchandise through customs. The import license entitles importers to pur- chase the necessary exchange (but not earlier than eight days before shipment when a documentary credit is opened). Because of foreign exchange difficulties, it has not been possible since about mid-1981 to adhere strictly to the annual import program. In practice, an ad hoc committee consisting of representatives of the Ministry of Finance and Economy, the Ministries of Commerce and Industry, the Central Bank, and the commercial banks meets on a weekly basis to administer the limited available foreign exchange and to ensure that the actual imports are in line with programed priorities and do not exceed foreign exchange availabilities. There are arrears on payments for imports. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require the prior approval of the Ministry of Finance, which has delegated approval authority to the Directorate of the Treasury and to authorized intermediaries, either up to specified limits or for any amount that is properly documented. Residents may purchase foreign exchange for tourism subject to an annual limit of FMG 100,000 a person a year (FMG 50,000 for children under ten). Any foreign ex- change remaining after return to Madagascar must be sur- rendered. For business travel, foreign exchange may be ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution purchased up to the equivalent of FMG 10,000 a person a day, subject to a maximum of FMG 300,000 a year. Authorized banks may not sell foreign bank notes in excess of the equivalent of FMG 20,000 a person a trip for tourist or business travel. Applications for additional amounts, and applications for exchange for any other type of travel, must be submitted to the Ministry of Finance and Economy. Applications for additional for- eign exchange for bona fide business trips and for medical treatment abroad are generally approved, but not for tourism. Allocations for different types of travel may not be combined without the prior approval of the Directorate of the Treasury. There are limits for educational expenses and certain other current invisibles. Dividends are transferable in fu ll when distributed by industrial firms and up to 75 per- cent in other cases; they may be transferred only to nonresident physical or juridical persons of foreign nationality. The transfer of savings from wages and salaries earned by a foreigner working in Madagascar is permitted, upon presentation of his work contract and employment permit, and provided that the transfer takes place within three months of the pay period. The amounts allowed are up to 25 percent of the net salary for bachelors and persons having their family in Madagas- car, and up to 45 percent for those whose families live outside Madagascar (100 percent for both categories during leave spent outside Madagascar); in all cases, the transferable amount may not exceed FMG 330,000 a person a month. Resident and nonresident travelers to foreign countries may take out up to FMG 5,000 in Malagasy bank notes. Nonresident travelers may take out any remaining foreign bank notes and coin and other foreign means of payment declared by them on entry. There are arrears on payments for invisibles. Exports and Export Proceeds Enterprises require the prior authorization (carte d'ex- portation) of the Ministry of Commerce to engage in export activity. All exports to all destinations require an export permit (autorisation d'exportation) issued by the Directorate of External Trade or the appropriate com- modity stabilization office. Export proceeds received in foreign currencies must be surrendered; such proceeds normally become due not later than one month after arrival of the goods at their destination unless the Directorate of the Treasury waives this requirement. All commercial export transactions valued at FMG 50,000 or more must be domiciled with an authorized inter- mediary, and the exporter must sign a commitment to repatriate the foreign currency proceeds. Subject to prior approval, exporters of manufactured products may retain specified percentages of export proceeds in convertible accounts denominated in Malagasy francs; funds in such accounts may be used freely by such exporters to import spare parts and other essential imports for their own production activity. The government-owned trading firms (CoROi, Roso, MADAGASCAR SICE, SINPA, and SOMACODIS) have a monopoly over exports of certain important commodities such as coffee, cloves, pepper, and butter beans. Proceeds from Invisibles All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services, and all income or proceeds accruing in those countries or from nonresidents, must be repatri- ated within one month of the due date. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of means of payment denominated in a foreign currency and up to FMG 5,000 in Malagasy bank notes. Capital Capital movements between Madagascar and foreign countries and between residents and nonresidents are subject to prior authorization by the Ministry of Finance and Economy. Special controls are maintained over borrowing abroad, over inward direct investment and all outward investment, and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Madagascar. Foreign direct investments in Madagascar,3 require prior approval of the Minister of Finance and Economy (the Directorate of the Treasury). Malagasy direct investments abroad4 are prohibited without special au- thorization from the Ministry of Finance and Economy. The total or partial liquidation of such investments must be declared to the Ministry of Finance and Economy. Both the making and the liquidation of direct invest- ments, whether these are Malagasy investments abroad or foreign investments in Madagascar, must be reported to the Minister within 20 days following each transac- tion. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a company, but such participation is subject to prior declaration to the Ministry of Finance and Economy. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Madagascar requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance and Economy. Exempt from authorization are operations in connection with shares similar to securities whose issue, offering, or sale in Madagascar has previously been authorized. Borrowing abroad by physical or juridical persons, whether public or private, requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance and Economy, although loans contracted by authorized banks or credit institutions with special legal status are exempt. Lending abroad is subject to authori- zation by the Ministry of Finance and Economy. In accordance with the Investment Code of Septem- ber 19, 1973, foreign or domestic enterprises of special importance to the economy may be granted preferential treatment in accordance w i th an "order of approval" (arrete d'agrement).

The middle rate of the Malawi kwacha for the IL._S^ dollar, the intervention currency, quoted by the Reserve Bank of Malawi is determined on the basis of the daily calcula- tions of the exchange rate of the U .S. dollar in terms of the SDR. On December 31, 1984 the Reserve Bank's buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were MK 1.5610 and MK 1.5728, respectively, per US$1. The Reserve Bank also quotes buying and selling rates for the Canadian dollar, the deutsche mark, the French franc, the South African rand, the pound sterling, the Swiss franc, the Zambian kwacha, and the Zimbabwe dollar, which are determined on the basis of the appropriate daily cross rates as communicated by the International Monetary Fund. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Reserve Bank under authority delegated to it by the Minister of Finance. Import policy is formulated by the Minister of Trade and Industry, who also is responsible for the issue of import and export licenses. Prescription of Currency Payments to nonresidents may be made in Malawi kwacha to the credit of a nonresident account maintained by the recipient or in any convertible foreign currency MALAWI authorities.

Annual allowances are not cumu la t ive but may be increased by up to 50 per- cent if the traveler has not applied for a travel allowance during the preceding three years. Allocations are subject to a combined max imum of MK 2,000 a year for a family traveling together. The basic exchange allowance for business travel is MK 40 a day, up to MK 400 a trip f o r ' a ny number of trips a year. Exchange is provided, subject to certain limits, for other purposes such as education, medical treatment, and family remittances. Applications for amounts exceeding the standard alloca- tions may be submitted to the exchange control authori- ties. Foreign nationals employed in Malawi on contracts and holding a temporary employment permit are allowed to remit up to two thirds of their current net earnings to their country of normal residence. Travelers may take out up to MK 20 in Malawi currency and the equivalent of MK 20 in foreign currency in addition to their basic travel allowance. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of goods of any description that exceed MK 100 in value are not allowed, unless the Controller of Customs and Excise is satisfied that payment has been made or will be made in an appropriate manner to a resident of Malawi not later than six months after the date of exportation. Certain commodities4 are subject to export licensing, mainly to ensure the adequacy of domestic supplies. Export proceeds in foreign currency must be sold to an authorized dealer.

Gold Residents may purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in Malawi for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and autho- rized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold at home or abroad in any form other than jewelry. Imports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Minister of Trade and Industry in consultation with the Ministry of Finance; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement January 17. The kwacha was depreciated, and the pegging arrangement was changed from the SDR to a new basket of currencies based on the geographical composition of Ma law i 's trade. In addition, the midpoint rate for the kwacha in terms of the U .S. dollar was depreciated by 3.2 percent w i th respect to the rate calculated on the basis of the previous peg to the SDR. Administration of Control November 1. The Exchange Control Ac t, 1984, came into e f fec t, replacing the Exchange Control Act of 1965. November 9.

MALAWI 327 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MALAYSIA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Malaysia is the Ringgit. The external value of the ringgit is determined on the basis of its relationship to a basket of currencies weighted in terms of Malaysia's major trading partners and the currencies of settlement. The exchange rate of the ringgit in terms of the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, is deter- mined in the foreign exchange market, and the Central Bank of Malaysia intervenes in order to promote relative stability in the value of the ringgit in relation to the basket of currencies. Rates for all other currencies are determined on the basis of the ringgit-U.S. dollar rate and the U .S. dollar rates for those currencies in markets abroad. The buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar on December 31, 1984 were M$2.4260 and M$2.4265, respectively, per US$1. The commercial banks are free to determine and quote exchange rates for all currencies to customers and are permitted to deal forward in all currencies. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Malaysia formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2 , 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from November 11, 1968. Administration of Control The Central Bank administers exchange control throughout Malaysia on behalf of the Malaysian Govern- ment, the Governor of the Bank being the Controller of Foreign Exchange. Most of the authority for approving payments abroad is delegated to authorized banks. The authority for import control rests with the Central Government. The day-to-day administration of import control throughout Malaysia is carried out jointly by the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Royal Customs and Excise. Prescription of Currency All payments to countries other than Israel and South Africa may be made either in ringgit through an External Account or in any currency other than Israeli and South African currencies. Receipts from exports to countries other than Israel and South Africa must be obtained according to the timing of payment specified in the commercial contract but subject to a maximum period of six months from the date of exportation, either in ringgit obtained from the sale of a specified currency to a bank in Malaysia or in any specified currency. Special regulations apply to settlements with Israel and South Africa. For a two-year period beginning from May 10, 1983, Malaysia maintains a countertrade agreement with a company in the Republic of Korea for the purchase of offshore patrol vessels. Nonresident Accounts The accounts in ringgit of residents of countries other than Malaysia are designated as External Accounts. 328 There are no restrictions on debits to External Accounts. Credits to these accounts for whatever purpose are freely permitted, subject only to the completion of exchange control forms for amounts above M$ 10,000; the pro- ceeds from the sale of any foreign currency may be credited to External Accounts. For amounts exceeding M$l0,000, permission may be given by authorized commercial banks. Balances in External Accounts may be transferred to any other account, whether resident or nonresident, and may be converted into any currency except Israeli and South African currencies. Accounts of residents of Israel and South Africa are designated as Israeli Accounts and South African Accounts respec- tively. All debits and credits to such accounts require prior approval. Imports and Import Payments Tariffs and import controls of the various parts of Malaysia have been fu l ly unified. Depending on the nature and origin of the goods, specific licenses are required for certain imports for reasons of health, security, or public policy; various conditions must be satisfied before licenses for such goods are issued. Certain other imports are subject to quantitative restric- tions as a temporary measure to protect local industries; these restrictions are reviewed from time to time. Imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Imports from the People's Republic of China are subject to specific license. Imports of motor vehicles are subject to specific licensing with quantitative restriction. Movements of live animals between Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak are subject to movement permits issued by the Veterinary Department. Imports of meat, bones, hides, skins, hooves, horns, and offals of any animal or any portion thereof from India require a specific license. Imports of primates are under specific license subject to approval from the Department of Wildlife and National Parks. Payment for permitted imports is allowed after exchange control formalities have been met. Raw mate- rials and machinery for the manufacturing sector are eligible for preferential treatment duty as follows: (a) raw materials not manufactured locally are subject to a reduced rate of import duty of 2 to 3 percent; (b) indus- tries can be further exempted from this 2 to 3 percent import duty if they comply with the New Economic Policy in terms of equity participation, management, and employment structure; (c) all customs duties and sales tax on imported machinery and equipment which is unavailable locally and used directly in the manufactur- ing process can be considered for exemption; and (d) im- port duty drawback can be claimed by any manufacturer, provided that evidence of export performance and importation of raw materials is submitted. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to all countries other than Israel and South Africa may be made without restriction after exchange control requirements have been met. There are no restrictions on the amount of foreign exchange made available for travel abroad. Remittances to nonresidents of dividends, interest, and profits on all bona fide investments are permitted, subject only to the completion of exchange control forms for amounts in excess of M$ 10,000. There are no restrictions on the export of currency notes by travelers. Exports and Export Proceeds1 Exports to Israel and South Africa are totally pro- hibited. The customs areas and export control systems between the three territories of Malaysia have been harmonized. Exchange control forms have to be com- pleted and authorized by banks in Malaysia for exports valued at M$5,000 f .o .b. or more (for exports to Indonesia, forms are not required except when exports are valued at more than M$ 100,000). Proceeds from exports must be received according to the timing of payment specified in the commercial contract, but subject to a maximum period of six months from the date of export, either in a specified currency or in ringgit obtained from the sale of a specified currency to a bank in Malaysia. Exports of rubber from Peninsular Malaysia require a certificate issued by the Malaysian Rubber Exchange and Licensing Board. Exports of cement and cement clinker, tiles, bricks, metals of all kinds includ- ing scrap, rice and paddy in whatever form, wheat flour, sugar, milk and specified milk products, textiles and all other goods as specified in the second schedule of the Customs (Prohibition of Exports) Order, 1978, of the 1967 Customs Act are subject to licensing. Proceeds from Invisibles The exchange control authorities do not regulate exchange receipts from invisibles, but receipts from exports are subject to exchange control. No limitations are imposed on the import of currency notes by travelers. Capital Inward investment covered by the guidelines issued on February 20, 1974 (regarding the acquisition of assets, mergers, and takeovers) requires prior approval by the Foreign Investment Committee. Majority equity partici- pation may be held by large foreign firms engaged in capital-intensive and resource-oriented enterprises, and full foreign ownership is permissible in export industries and other specified sectors. The proceeds of investments may be repatriated freely on resale, subject to the completion of exchange control formalities for amounts above M$10,000. Companies in Malaysia controlled by nonresidents are permitted to borrow in Malaysia up to 'Exports of sawlogs above 41 centimeters in diameter from Peninsular Malaysia are prohibited, with effect from January 1, 1985. MALAYSIA M$500,000 w i thout exchange control approval. The permission of the Controller of Foreign Exchange is freely given for direct and portfolio investment by Malaysian residents in countries other than Israel and South Africa. Commercial banks are discouraged from giving loans to finance investments abroad; such funds should be used to finance the expansion of productive capacity in Malaysia. Residents may borrow freely from abroad sums wh ich are individually less than M$ 100,000; beyond that amount, permission must be obtained from the Control- ler, stating the main terms and conditions of the loan and the purpose for which the loan proceeds would be used. Service payments on approved foreign loans may be permitted by the commercial banks on behalf of the Controller, provided these payments are in accordance with the approved terms and conditions. Commercial banks and merchant banks in Malaysia can lend in foreign currency to residents and accept deposits in foreign currency from nonresidents. Loans in foreign currency by banks in Malaysia must be for business and productive purposes in Malaysia, including (but not exclusively) payment for the import of goods and services, payment of interest or repayment of principal on loans from nonresidents, or payment for the purchase from nonresidents of immovable properties in Malaysia or stocks and shares, provided that, for the purchase of property or shares, (a) the Foreign Investment Commit- tee has given its approval, (b) the amount borrowed does not exceed the equivalent of M$25 million, and (c) repayment of principal will not be made with funds borrowed in ringgit from residents. The approval of the Controller is required for all other foreign currency loans. As an incentive, interest paid to nonresidents by the commercial banks is exempted from payment of the 15 percent withholding tax. Gold Residents of Malaysia are permitted to purchase, sell, borrow, lend, hold, or export gold, provided that the weight of individual bars and wafers does not exceed 100 grams in each case. A traveler may import, on one's own person or in personal luggage, any number of gold coins issued by the Central Bank of Malaysia but only one piece of any other type of gold coin, medallion, bar, or wafer not exceeding 100 grams in weight. The importation of gold is otherwise regulated by specific license issued by the Ministry of Trade and Industry, the policy being to limit such importation to authorized dealers who are required to quote daily buy ing and selling prices for the wafers that they retail to the public. Changes During 1984 Exports and Export Proceeds June 10. A ban on the export of sawlogs above 41 centimeters in diameter from Peninsular Malaysia was announced with effect from January 1, 1985. 329 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MALAYSIA Capital August 3. In a relaxation of regulations on foreign investment it was announced that majority equity shares could be held by large foreign firms engaged in capital- intensive and resource-oriented enterprises. (The New Economic Policy introduced in 1970 had required for- eign ownership in the corporate sector to be progres- sively reduced to 30 percent by 199Q } In addition, the possibility of 100 percent foreign ownership, previously limited to export industries, was extended to other sectors. 330 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MALDIVES (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Maldives is the Maldivian rufiyaa, which replaced the Maldivian rupee on July 1, 1981. The official exchange rate of the rufiyaa is set by the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA). Since March 31, 1982, the MM A has maintained a buying rate of Rf 7.00 = US$1 and a selling rate of Rf 7.05 = US$1 in its transactions with commercial banks. Standing in- structions by the MMA to the commercial banks require them to buy foreign exchange at Rf 7.00 = US$1 and to sell at a rate not exceeding Rf 7.10 = US$1. Beginning from September 1983, in addition to direct inflow of foreign exchange to the commercial banks, quarterly quotas of exchange are made available by the MMA to each commercial bank .l Administration of Control There is no exchange control legislation. Trade con- trols are administered by the Ministry of Trade and Industries, which also issues import and export licenses. Prescription of Currency Since January 25, 1982 all local transactions between residents and nonresidents, such as the settlement of tourism bills, must be made in local currency. There are no restrictions on maintaining balances in foreign cur- rency. No bilateral payments agreements are in force. Nonresident Accounts No distinction is made between accounts held by residents and those held by nonresidents; and there are no restrictions on keeping foreign currency balances. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. There are, in general, no restrictions on imports. However, import operations may be conducted only after being registered and licensed at the Ministry of Trade and Industries. All imports of trading goods by the private sector are required to be made on a letter of credit basis.2 Most staple commodities (including rice, sugar, wheat flour, medicines, and petroleum products) are imported by the State Trading Organization. Payments for Invisibles Travelers may freely take out any amount in domestic or foreign currency, without any restriction. !The quota arrangement was discontinued on January 1, 1985. 2 The regulation requiring all imports to be made on a letter of credit basis was abolished on February 10, 1985. Exports and Export Proceeds Export operations are conducted only after being registered and licensed at the Ministry of Trade and Industries. Export of black coral and tortoise shells is prohibited, except in the form of a product. Export duty is levied on ambergris exported by a Maldivian, goods exported by a Maldivian jointly with a foreigner, and goods exported by a foreigner; re-exports are exempt. Exporters of dutiable goods are required to import goods or foreign exchange equal to the value of the goods exported, within the period of time specified in the license. In the case of duty-free exports, exporters may, upon request by the Government, be required to import specified goods in an amount not exceeding 33 percent of the value of the goods exported. Proceeds from Invisibles Private sector receipts from current invisibles need not be surrendered and may be disposed of freely through the foreign exchange market. Travelers may bring in any amount of foreign currency without restriction. Capital Residents and nonresidents may freely import and export capital through the foreign exchange market, and residents do not require permission to maintain foreign currency accounts at home or abroad. Inward direct investment requires approval. All foreign investors are required to provide at least 75 percent of their capital investment either in the form of cash or in capital goods financed from outside Maldives. Transfers of profits are permitted, and exemptions from taxes other than tourism taxes may be granted for a period of up to ten years. Gold Transactions in gold are not subject to regulation. Residents may freely hold and negotiate gold in any form, at home or abroad, and the import and export of gold are not restricted. Changes During 1984 January 1. The accounting rate used for the valuation of imports subject to customs duty and for the setting of domestic prices of imported basic food items was changed from Rf 6.00 to Rf 7.00, per U.S. dollar. September 1. The accounting rate used for the deter- mination of domestic prices of imported Pharmaceuticals was raised from Rf 6.50 to Rf 7.00, per U. S. dollar. 331 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MALI (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Mali is the CFA Franc,1 which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. Exchange rates for all other currencies that are officially quoted on the Paris exchange market are based on the fixed rate for the French franc and the Paris exchange market rate for the currency concerned. The BCEAO levies commissions of 0.1 per mill and 2.5 per mill, respectively, on transfers to or from nonmembers of the West African Monetary Union. The banks also charge a separate commission, a portion of which is transferred to the Treasury. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of measures relating to gold and the repatriation of export proceeds, Mali's exchange controls do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control The Minister of Finance and Commerce has sole authority in exchange control matters; certain exchange control powers have been delegated to the BCEAO and to authorized banks. The bilateral payments agreement accounts2 are operated by the Development Bank of Mali. Licenses for imports and exports are issued by the Directorate-General of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance and Commerce. Prescription of Currency Settlements on account of transactions covered by bi- lateral payments agreements are made in currencies and through accounts established under such agreements. Since Mali is an Operations Account country, set- tlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any Operations Account country. Settlements with all other countries with which no payments agreement is in force are usually made through correspondent banks in France, in any of the currencies of those countries, or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. Settlements 'The CFA franc is issued by the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de 1'Quest (BCEAO) and is the common currency in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo. 2Ma li maintains bilateral payments agreements with the People's Republic of China, Hungary, Morocco, Romania, the U .S .S .R ., and Viet Nam. With the exception of those w i th the People's Republic of China and the U .S .S .R ., these agreements are inoperative. 332 with The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are normally made through the West African Clearing House. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are, in principle, based on those applied in France. Imports and Import Payments The import licensing system introduced in 1977 distinguishes five categories of imports: (1) imports subject to quotas and requiring an import license (Re- gime A); (2) imports admitted freely and requiring only an import certificate (Regime B); (3) imports without settlement in foreign exchange (Regime C); (4) imports by government monopolies (Regime D); and (5) imports subject to special prohibitions for reasons of security, public health, etc. (Regime E). Imports originating in a member country of the West African Economic Commu- nity are subject to Regime B; some products from EC countries, such as foodstuffs and other basic necessities not reserved for state monopolies, are also included in Regime B. Other products from the EC countries, such as luxury consumer goods and products that compete with local production, are subject to quota under Regime A, as are all commodities from all other countries. Imports financed directly from foreign re- sources, for example, from grants, foreign investment, or development loans, are admitted virtually freely under Regime C. Specified foodstuffs (including sugar, tea, salt, milk, and canned tomatoes), tobacco products, and fertilizers can only be imported by state agencies designated as monopolies under Regime D. Imports from Israel, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and South Africa are prohibited. Imports are licensed in accordance with an annual import program. A license is valid for six months bu t, if necessary, may be extended for a further period of three months. However, the system is implemented flexibly, and licenses in excess of the program are issued for justified need or unforeseen circumstances. Imports may be made by either private importers or state enterprises, among the most important of which is the Societe Malienne d'Import-Export (SoMiEX), with its monopoly over basic commodities. An allocation commission establishes quotas for each private importer on the basis of his turnover. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to approval. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution been approved or does not require authorization. Trans- fers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are subject to approval. For tourist travel, residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may obtain an annual exchange allocation equivalent to CFAF 250,000 a person (CFAF 125,000 for children under 10), which may be allotted on several occasions during the year; any unused foreign exchange must be surrendered to an authorized intermediary within eight days after the return to Mali. For business travel, the allocation is the equivalent of CFAF 25,000 a day, subject to a maximum of CFAF 250,000 a trip.3 Residents traveling to foreign countries may take out up to CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO bank notes, or the equivalent in Bank of France bank notes, or bank notes issued by other Operations Account countries (CFAF 2,500 for trips of less than 24 hours). Nonresident travelers may freely take out foreign bank notes up to the equivalent of CFAF 100,000; higher amounts may be taken out only if declared upon entry. They may also take out CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO bank notes, or the equivalent in Bank of France bank notes, or bank notes issued by other Operations Account coun- tries, and any payments instruments drawn up abroad in their name. The transfer of the entire salary of a foreigner working in Mali is permitted upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher, provided that the transfer takes place within three months of the pay period or where there is a reciprocity agreement with the foreigner's country of nationality. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to foreign countries must be recorded with an authorized bank, and all export proceeds, including those originating in France and other Operations Ac- count countries, must be repatriated and surrendered within one month of payment due date or within 90 days from shipment if no payment date is specified in the sales contract. Exports to countries outside the West African Economic Community require individual licenses; those to countries of the West African Economic Community require only a certificate. The export of cotton and groundnuts is reserved, in principle, for SOMIEX. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Ac- 3 Exchange for tourist travel purposes is made available only to persons submitting an exit permit (autorisation de sortie) issued by the Security Services. MALI count countries may be retained. All amoun ts due from residents of other countries for services and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be collected and surrendered. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BCEAO, the Bank of France, or a bank of issue ma in ta in ing an Operations Account w i th the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) of countries outside the French Franc Area. Capital Capital movements between Mali and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require exchange control approval and are restricted, but capital receipts from such coun- tries are permitted freely. Special controls (in addition to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable) are maintained over borrowing abroad, although the Development Bank of Mali is exempt from these controls. The special control measures also do not apply to relations with France (as defined above) and the Operations Account countries. Under an Investment Code of March 30, 1976, the Government may grant special privileged status, provi- ding for transfer, tax, and other preferential treatment to foreign investments that would be of special interest to the Malian economy and that are compatible w i th the goals of the Economic Plan. Gold Travelers may export gold jewelry and personal belongings, other than gold coin and ingots, up to a maximum weight of 500 grams. Commercial imports and exports of gold do not require authorization by the Ministry of Finance and Commerce but are subject to customs declaration as prescribed by the customs regulations. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement June 1. Mali became a member of the West African Monetary Union, changing its currency from the Mali franc to the CFA franc, and adopting the type of exchange and trade system generally applied by member countries of the Union. 333 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MALTA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Malta is the Maltese Lira. The value of the Maltese lira is determined on the basis of the fixed relationship between the Maltese lira and a trade- weighted basket of currencies1 representing Malta's important trading partners. The daily exchange rate between the Maltese lira and the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, is derived by adding up the latest dollar values of the currency components of the Maltese lira basket; the midday quotations in Hong Kong are used in the computations. In dealings with the commer- cial banks, a spread of 0.125 percent is applied between the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar. On December 31, 1984 the buying and selling rates for the Maltese lira in terms of the U.S. dollar in such dealings were US$2.0346 and US$2.0320, respectively, per Lm 1. The Central Bank also quotes daily rates for various other currencies, including the deutsche mark, the Italian lira, and the pound sterling, on the basis of the rate for the U .S. dollar and the cross rates for these currencies in the principal exchange markets abroad. The Central Bank's basic rate (middle rate) for the pound sterling on December 31, 1984 was £ stg. 1.7482 per Lm 1. The commercial banks' rates for currencies not quoted by the Central Bank are based on market rates in London and New York. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Exchange controls are administered by the Central Bank, as agent for the Minister of Finance; trade controls are administered by the Director of Trade in the Ministry of Trade. The approval authority for the allocation of foreign exchange for certain purposes has been delegated to the authorized banks, which also may give or renew guarantees for any purpose provided they hold full cash cover in Maltese lira or foreign currency for the period of the guarantee. Prescription of Currency Authorized payments to all countries may be made by crediting Maltese lira to an External Account or in any foreign currency;2 the proceeds of exports to all coun- tries may be received in Maltese lira from an External Account or in any foreign currency. Under a policy of "trade reciprocity," Malta maintains bilateral trade agreements with a number of other countries, including the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Turkey, to promote exports of Maltese goods in return for the importation of specified goods from the respec- 1 Deutsche mark, French francs, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. 2 Foreign currencies are defined as all currencies other than the Maltese lira. 334 tive partner countries. Outstanding balances under these agreements can be settled in convertible currencies. Nonresident Accounts Residents of all countries outside Malta may maintain with authorized banks nonresident accounts in Maltese lira, designated External Accounts. These accounts may be credited freely with authorized payments to nonresi- dents, with transfers from other External Accounts, and with the proceeds from sales of gold or any foreign currency (including bank notes). External Accounts may be debited freely for payments to residents, for transfers to other External Accounts, for payments in cash in Malta, and for purchases of any foreign currency (including bank notes). Authorized dealers may freely open and maintain Foreign Currency Accounts for nonresidents. These accounts may be credited with payments in foreign currency to the account holder, with transfers from another foreign currency account belonging to a nonresi- dent, and with interest payable on Foreign Currency Accounts. They may be debited for payments by the account holder to residents, for transfers to other Foreign Currency Accounts, and for transfers abroad. Subject to exchange control permission, companies controlled by nonresidents or residents may maintain Foreign Cur- rency Accounts in Malta or abroad. Imports and Import Payments Imports of all commodities are, in principle, subject to either state-trading or licensing requirements. Imports from Italy are allowed only for industrial supplies, spare parts, "reciprocity goods," and items which, in the view of the Licensing Division, merit ad hoc consideration. All imports from Japan are banned with the exception of spare parts for products already in Malta. The importa- tion, in finished form, of certain goods that can be produced domestically is restricted; this restriction cov- ers more than 60 different products, most of which are leather goods, textile goods, and meat products. Certain imports are subject to state trading. These include commodities regarded as essential, such as tinned milk, butter, meat, livestock for slaughter, wheat, barley, corn, potatoes, soybean oil, rice, sugar, tinned meat and fish, cheese, coffee, tea, f ru i t, cement, steel, and timber. Payments for all authorized imports may be made freely, provided that the prescription of currency regula- tions are complied with and that supporting documents, including the customs entry form and the related import license, are submitted to the intermediary bank. As a form of exchange cover, and subject to exchange control approval, residents may keep Foreign Currency Ac- counts to settle import payments; on the same basis, import payments may also be offset against export proceeds. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles require the approval of the exchange control authorities but approval authority for most types of payment has been delegated to authorized banks. For residents, there is a maximum exchange allocation for tourist travel of the equivalent of Lm 250 a person for a trip of not less than six nights (prorated for trips of different duration), subject to a maximum of one such trip in 60 days, and a business travel allowance of Lm 70 a day a person up to a limit of Lm 1,500 a trip, subject to a limit of one such trip in 30 days; requests beyond the specified limits require the exceptional consideration of the Central Bank. Expenses (other than air or sea fares) defrayed in advance in Malta in connection with such trips are counted within the foreign exchange allowance. There is also an allowance for educational expenses abroad of Lm 3,000 a person for an academic year.3 Applications for allowances in excess of these amounts are approved by the Central Bank if it is satisfied that no illicit capital outflow is involved. Nonresident travelers may import any amount of foreign currency and may export foreign currency up to the amount brought in by them and declared to the customs on entry. The transfer of profits, dividends, and interest from approved foreign investments requires central bank permission, which is normally given, after compliance with certain formalities. Life insurance expressed in Malta currency may be contracted only with insurance companies that are duly licensed as required under the Insurance Business Act, 1981. Remittances for the maintenance of dependents abroad are allowed on application showing evidence of hardship. Up to Lm 25 in Maltese notes and coins may be exported by a traveler. Exports and Export Proceeds With the exception of works of art and certain essential goods, all commodities may be exported freely. However, certain textile products for export to EC countries are subject to licensing. The proceeds of exports must be surrendered within six months of shipment. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles must be offered for sale to an authorized bank. Travelers may bring in any amount in foreign currency notes, but without an authorization by the Minister of Finance, importation of any notes and coin which are or have been legal tender in Malta is permitted only up to Lm 50. 3 For purposes of exchange allocations for travel and study, residents are defined as physical persons who are at the time living in Malta and either have lived there for at least three years or intend to continue living there for at least three years. MALTA Capital No control is exercised over capital receipts, although receipts in foreign currencies must be offered for sale to an authorized bank. Payments abroad of a capital nature require prior approval. Applications for outward direct investment by residents and for direct investment in Malta by nonresidents are considered on their merits. The Immovable Property (Acquisition by Nonresidents) Act, 1974, administered by the Ministry of Finance, prohibits the acquisition of immovable property in Malta by nonresidents,4 with the exception of certain special cases mainly related to economic development. Applica- tions for the acquisition of property for use as a residence by individuals who do not already hold property in Malta are given favorable consideration. Purchases of personal real estate situated outside Malta require prior exchange control approval. Foreign nationals who take up residence outside Malta normally are allowed to transfer all their assets to their new country of residence. Maltese nationals who emi- grate may transfer abroad up to Lm 7,500 for each family; any excess amount is normally released three years after the date of departure on application to the Central Bank. Banks, other than those licensed to borrow and lend only outside Malta, are restricted in the acquisition of net foreign assets. Gold Malta has issued 23 denominations of gold coin which are legal tender. Residents are allowed to hold coin and to acquire jewelry, but they require exchange control permission to purchase and sell any gold coin that is not legal tender. The import of gold coin is controlled to ensure that such coins are genuinely for numismatic purposes. A specific import license is required for imports of gold coin, gold bullion, and manufactured or semimanufactured articles of gold; imports of filigree work of gold or silver are prohibited. Subject to exchange control permission, authorized importers may import gold bullion only to supply jewelers and other industrial users. The export of gold by residents other than the monetary authorities also requires exchange control permission. Gold bullion and gold coin are free of import du ty. Changes During 1984 Imports and Import Payments October 25. Imports from Italy were restricted. 4For the purpose of this Act, the term nonresidents means (1) individuals who are not residents of Malta; (2) any association of persons, or any en t i ty, whether corporate or not, if (a) it is registered outside Malta, or (b) it has its principal place of residence or of business outside Malta, or (c) 20 percent or more of its share or other capital is owned by a nonresident person, or (d) it is in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, controlled by one or more nonresident persons. 335 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Exchange Arrangement The currency of Mauritania is the Mauritanian Ou- guiya. The exchange rate for the ouguiya is determined on the basis of a basket of currencies comprising the Belgian franc, the deutsche mark, the French franc, the Italian lira, the Spanish peseta, and the U .S. dollar. The relative weights assigned to each currency are based on that currency's relative importance in Mauritania's total exchange transactions and are revised from time to time. The opening spot rates of the currencies in the basket against the U.S. dollar on the Paris exchange market are then compared with the exchange rates prevailing on specified base dates. The arithmetic average of the sum of the weighted variations arising from this comparison results in either a plus or a minus overall variation of the U.S. dollar in terms of the other currencies in the basket; this variation is then applied to the ouguiya-U.S. dollar rate prevailing on June 29, 1973 (UM 46.041 = US$1), thus obtaining the reference rate for the dollar on the specific day. Daily exchange rates for 15 other curren- cies,1 including the currencies used in the basket, are obtained from the daily reference rate for the U .S. dollar and the cross rates for these currencies in the Paris exchange market. Mauritania confines the official exchange rate for the ouguiya within margins of 4.5 percent; at present, it applies margins of zero percent in respect of exchange transactions. There are no taxes or subsidies on pur- chases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Exchange control authority is vested in the Central Bank and the Minister of Finance. The Central Bank has delegated some approval authority to authorized banks. The Central Bank is authorized to obtain any information necessary to compile balance of payments statistics. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through authorized banks or, in some cases, through the Postal Administration. Import and export licenses, where required, are issued by the Foreign Trade Department in the Ministry of Commerce. All import licenses require exchange control approval by the Cen- tral Bank. Prescription of Currency All settlements with Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Settlements with other countries usually take place in convertible currencies. Nonresident Accounts There are two kinds of nonresident accounts in domestic currency: Convertible Accounts, which may be 'Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Moroccan dirhams, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. 336 MAURITANIA (Position on December 31, 1984) credited only w i th proceeds from the sale of foreign currency or transfers from other Convertible Accounts, and Internal Nonresident Accounts, which may be credited with domestic bank notes. Convertible Ac- counts may be debited for any payment without central bank approval, but payments to and withdrawals from these accounts may not be made in foreign bank notes without special approval from the Central Bank. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited, and imports of a few goods are prohibited for reasons of health or public policy. Only holders of importer- exporter cards are permitted to engage in import transac- tions. Imports of all commodities must be authorized by the Central Bank. The National Import-Export Corpora- tion (SONIMEX) has a monopoly over imports of sugar, rice, and green tea. Although there is no formal import program, authorizations can be denied if the volume of imports in any period is deemed excessive. There are some arrears on import payments. Import transactions must be domiciled with an autho- rized bank, except in the case of imports "without payment." After the approval of the Central Bank has been obtained, the import license entitles the importer to purchase the necessary exchange, but not earlier than ten days before shipment if a documentary credit is opened or eight days before the payment is due if the com- modities have already arrived. Advance payments for imports require prior approval by the Central Bank. The Central Bank authorizes only the payment of import bills quoting f .o .b. or c. & f. prices, and all imports must be insured with the Mauritanian State Insurance Company (SMAR). There are special arrangements for imports in border areas. Payments for Invisibles Payments to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Payments for invisibles to other countries are subject to the approval of the Central Bank, which has delegated its approval authority for certain specified payments to authorized banks. Basic exchange allocations have been established for various types of invisibles. For tourist travel, residents may obtain an annual exchange allocation equivalent to UM 10,000 a person (UM 5,000 for children under ten). For business travel, the allocations are the equivalent of UM 50,000 a person a trip to African countries, UM 90,000 to Europe, and UM 120,000 to other destinations. The use of all travel allocations must be marked in a personal travel exchange booklet. The transfer of savings from salaries by foreigners working in Mauritania is permitted up to varying percentages, according to marital status. At the end of their stay in Mauritania, they may transfer all their assets abroad. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Travelers are not allowed to take out domestic bank notes. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Only holders of importer-exporter cards are permitted to engage in export transactions. Export transactions to all countries in excess of UM 5,000 must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Exporters must sign an undertaking to repatriate and surrender the foreign exchange pro- ceeds. Exports to all countries require authorization and endorsement by the Central Bank. Export proceeds must be surrendered not later than the due date of the payment, which normally must not be more than 60 days after shipment. Exports of gum arabic are the monopoly of SONIMEX, and exports of iron ore are the monopoly of the National Industrial and Mining Company (SNIM). Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles must be surrendered. All amounts due from nonresidents in respect of services and all income earned abroad from foreign assets must be collected and surrendered within four months of the due date of the payment. The importation of domestic bank notes by travelers is prohibited. Capital Transfers of capital between Mauritania and Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Capital movements between Mauritania and all foreign countries are subject to exchange control; capital transfers to all countries re- quire exchange control approval and are restricted, but capital receipts normally are permitted freely, although the subsequent investment of the funds in Mauritania may require approval, as indicated below. All investments abroad by residents require prior authorization by the Central Bank. Foreign direct invest- ments in Mauritania2 and Mauritanian direct investments MAURITANIA abroad3 must be declared to the Central Bank before they are made. The Central Bank has the right to request the postponement of the projects w i th in 15 days from receipt of the declaration. The fu ll or partial liquidation of inward or outward investment also requires a declara- tion. Both the making and the liquidation of investments, whether these are Mauritanian investments abroad or foreign investments in Mauritania, must be reported to the Central Bank within 20 days following each opera- tion. Direct investments are defined as investments implying control of a company or enterprise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Mauritania requires prior authorization by the Central Bank, as does borrowing by residents from nonresidents. The Investment Code (Ordinance No. 79046 of March 15, 1979) provides for various benefits for private investments in Mauritania and stipulates that profits and dividends accruing from such investment can be trans- ferred freely. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Mauritania. All imports and exports of gold require prior authorization by the Central Bank. Exempt from this requirement are imports and exports by the Central Bank and manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles). Changes During 1984 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 2 Including those made by companies in Mauritania that are directly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in Mauritania of foreign companies. 3 Including those made through foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in Mauritania and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Mauritania. 337 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAURITIUS (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Mauritius is the Mauritian Rupee, the external value of which is determined on the basis of its relationship to a weighted basket of currencies of Mauritius' major trading partners. The Bank of Mauritius applies margins of 0.125 percent to the buying rate and 0.25 percent to the selling rate in respect of exchange transactions in sterling and U .S. dollars, and of 0.3125 percent to the buying rate and 0.625 percent to the selling rate in respect of exchange transactions in French francs, using rates obtained on the basis of the fixed peg to the basket of currencies. On December 31, 1984 the buying and selling rates of the Bank of Mauritius were Mau Rs 18.1533 and Mau Rs 18.2200, respectively, per £ stg. 1, Mau Rs 15.5867 and Mau Rs 15.6433, respectively, per US$1, and Mau Rs 1.6200 and Mau Rs 1.6333, respectively, per F 1. Commercial banks are authorized to deal in the French franc, sterling, and the U .S. dollar at rates based on the rates quoted by the Bank of Mauritius for these currencies. Spreads allowed between buying and selling rates of the commercial banks for transactions by telegraphic transfers are up to 1 percent for transactions in pounds sterling, 1.5 percent for the U.S. dollar, and 2.2 percent for the French franc. Commercial banks' buying and selling rates for other foreign currenciesl are determined on the basis of appropriate cross rates in the London market and the cost of forward cover in appropriate cases. Forward exchange facilities are made available by the Bank of Mauritius for industries operat- ing in the Export Processing Zone and for banks engaged in foreign borrowing for on-lending to the sugar sector. The maximum period for forward cover is six months; the forward rates are based on a uniform margin of 3 percent a year. A stamp duty of 45 percent is applied to outward transfers of capital (other than banking funds) and purchases of gold coin and gold bullion. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Bank of Mauritius under powers delegated to it by the Financial Secretary. The authority for approving virtually all current payments is in turn delegated to the commercial banks. The Ministry of Trade and Shipping is responsi- ble for the issue of import and export permits, where required. Prescription of Currency For prescription of currency purposes Mauritius dis- tinguishes between countries in the former Sterling Area2 and External Account countries. Payments to residents of former Sterling Area countries may be made in rupees to a Sterling Area Account in Mauritius or in any currency of the former Sterling Area. Payments from residents of the former Sterling Area may be received in rupees from a Sterling Area Account in Mauritius or in any currency of the former Sterling Area. Payments to residents of countries outside the former Sterling Area may be made in rupees to a Sterling Area Account or an External Account in Mauritius, in sterling to an External Account in the United Kingdom, or in any non-Sterling Area currency. Payments from residents of countries outside the former Sterling Area may be received in rupees from an External Account in Mauritius, in sterling from an External Account in the United King- dom, or in any non-Sterling Area currency. Nonresident Accounts There are two main types of nonresident accounts (in Mauritian rupees): Sterling Area Accounts and External Accounts. Sterling Area Accounts, which may be opened by persons and firms resident in countries of the former Sterling Area (see footnote 2) may be credited with (1) authorized payments by residents of Mauritius; (2) any transfers from other Sterling Area Accounts; (3) any payments from External Accounts held in Mauritius or elsewhere in the former SterlingArea; and (4) the proceeds of the sale to an authorized dealer of any foreign currency or gold by nonresidents of Mauritius. They may be debited for (1) payments from residents of the former Sterling Area to residents of Mauritius; (2) transfers to other Sterling Area Accounts; (3) trans- fers to External Accounts in Mauritius or elsewhere in the former Sterling Area in respect of which the permission of the exchange control authorities in the appropriate country has been given; and (4) the cost of purchase of any former Sterling Area currency. External Accounts may be opened by persons and firms resident outside both Mauritius and the former Sterling Area. They may be credited with (1) authorized payments by residents of Mauritius; (2) payments from Sterling Area Accounts in respect of which the permis- sion of the exchange control authorities of the appropri- ate country has been given; (3) any transfers from other External Accounts; and (4) the proceeds of the sale to an authorized dealer of any non-Sterling Area currency or gold by nonresidents of Mauritius and the former Sterling Area. They may be debited for (1) any payments to residents of Mauritius; (2) any transfers to Sterling !The exchange control regulations of Mauritius define foreign currencies as all currencies other than the Mauritian rupee. 2 The exchange control regulations of Mauritius define the Sterling Area as comprising the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, and the Republic of Ireland. 338 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Area Accounts; (3) any transfers to other External Accounts; and (4) the cost of purchase of any foreign currency or gold. In addition to the above, there are also Blocked Accounts to which are credited funds owned by persons and firms resident outside Mauritius and realized from investments made by them prior to April 5, 1966, as well as funds representing emigrants' assets in excess of Mau Rs 100,000. Such accounts may be credited w i th payments by residents of Mauritius that have been specifically authorized for credit to a Blocked Account and may be debited for certain specified transactions. Funds from Blocked Accounts may, w i th approval, be invested in Mauritius. Upon the realization of such investments, the proceeds are directed once more to a Blocked Account. Imports and Import Payments Importers must be licensed under the Licenses Ordi- nance. Under the Supplies (Control of Imports) Regula- tions of 1982, all imports other than goods exempted or prohibited, as specified in the third and fourth schedules, respectively, require import permits from the Ministry of Trade and Shipping; the permits are essentially for statistical and tax purposes. In addition to an import permit, importers must apply for exchange control approval to make the corresponding import payments, subject to compliance with the prescription of currency regulations. Certain imports are subject to customs surcharges; a stamp duty of 12 percent based on the c . i . f. value and a surcharge of 10 percent thereon are levied on most imports. Importers of goods of lower priority may not avail themselves of suppliers' credits, and local commercial banks are prohibited from extending credit for such imports. The contracting of suppliers' credit of more than 90 days' duration in respect of other categories of imports requires the prior approval of the Bank of Mauritius, except for imports effected by companies holding a development certificate or by companies in the Export Processing Zone. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles related to imports require the prior approval of the exchange control authorities. Foreign exchange for other purposes, such as foreign travel, may be provided up to specified limits by the commercial banks without prior reference to the ex- change control authorities. A 10 percent tax together with a surcharge of 10 percent thereon is levied on all international air tickets purchased by Mauritian residents for journeys originating from Mauritius. The allowance for business travel is the equivalent of £ stg. 50 a day. Applications for exchange for business travel are exam- ined by the Bank of Mauritius. There are established limits for payments and transfers to former Sterling Area countries and to non-Sterling Area countries in respect of family support, salary remittances by non-Mauritian nationals, trade commissions, subscriptions to clubs and societies, publishing rights, advertising outside MAURITIUS Mau r i t ius, royalties, professional and technical services, education, and leave salaries. Applications for amounts exceeding the standard allocations may be submitted to the exchange control authorities. Residents and nonresident travelers may take out Mau Rs 350 in domestic currency. Resident travelers may take out foreign currency notes up to the amount of their travel allowance. Nonresident travelers may take out any foreign currency declared upon entry. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of (1) articles made wholly or partially of gold, p la t inum, or silver; (2) diamonds, precious and semiprecious stones, pearls, and articles mounted with these; and (3) works of art are prohibited, unless permission is obtained from the Financial Secretary. All exports valued at more than Mau Rs 1,000 and all exports of food products valued at over Mau Rs 50 require an export permit from the Ministry of Trade and Shipping. Exports of certain foodstuffs, including fru i ts, are controlled. The Mauritius Sugar Syndicate is the sole exporter of sugar. A tax ranging from 7 percent to 13.5 percent, plus a surcharge of 75 percent thereon, is levied on the f .o .b. value of sugar exports, depending on quan t i ty; volumes of under 75 tons are exempted. All export proceeds in any currency other than Mauritian rupees must be offered for sale to an authorized dealer. However, permission may be given to large export- import companies to retain export proceeds for a rea- sonable period of time to meet payments for imports. Exports of knit shirts and sweaters of cotton, wool, and man-made fibers to Canada and the United States are effected under bilateral export restraint agreements. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in any currency other than Mauritian rupees must be offered for sale to an autho- rized dealer. There is no limitation on the amount of foreign currency notes and coin that may be imported, but not more than Mau Rs 700 in domestic currency notes and coin may be imported by travelers. Capital Inward transfers of capital are not restricted. Outward transfers of capital are subject to certain restrictions. Nonbank residents of Maur i t ius may, subject to permis- sion, transfer a reasonable amount of capital to any country on payment of a 45 percent stamp du ty. Nonresidents require permission to transfer capital to any country; transfers are subject to the stamp duty of 45 percent and, if directed toward a country outside the former Sterling Area by a resident of the former Sterling Area, require the prior approval of the exchange control authorities of the former Sterling Area country con- cerned. Foreign-owned companies may freely transfer abroad dividends, profits, and interest on capital. Per- mission for repatriation of capital is not granted for 339 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAURITIUS capital brought in before April 5, 1966, irrespective of the country of origin, bu t, in normal circumstances, it is given for capital brought in on or after that date. Proceeds from the sale, liquidation, etc., of foreign capital that may not be repatriated must be credited to Blocked Accounts. Emigrants may take out, at the official rate of exchange and free of stamp du ty, the equivalent of Mau Rs 100,000 from their Mauritian assets when emigrating to any country; this facility is available upon redesignation as a nonresident, which occurs upon departure. The balance of an emigrant's funds must be credited for an indefinite period to a Blocked Account; any releases that may be approved for transfer abroad are subject to payment of the 45 percent stamp duty. Persons emigrating from Mauritius are not entitled to draw their personal travel allowance in addition to the emigration facilities. Gold Residents other than the monetary authorities are permitted to hold gold for numismatic purposes (includ- ing commemorative gold coins of Mau Rs 200 and Mau Rs 1,000) or as personal jewelry and ornaments. The import and export of monetary gold are prohibited, except when made by the monetary authorities. Imports of gold for industrial purposes are subject to a quota and specific import permit. Exports of articles made wholly or partially of gold, other than jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler, are prohibited. Payments in respect of private imports of gold coin and gold bullion are subject to the 45 percent stamp du ty. Imports of certain jewelry are subject to temporary customs surcharges. Changes During 1984 Imports and Import Payments April 3. All quota restrictions on goods carrying customs duty at the rate of 60 percent and above were abolished. June 12. A surcharge of 10 percent on both customs and stamp duties on imports was introduced. June 12. As a means of encouraging increased use of computers, the customs duty on the imports of com- puters and components was reduced from 80 percent to 50 percent. June 22. Twenty-eight different items that were banned from import as a measure of protection of local industries became subject to quotas of no less than 25 percent of estimated total demand in 1982, the year in which the prohibitions were imposed. July 13. All quota restrictions on goods carrying customs duty at a rate between 30 percent and 60 percent were eliminated. 340 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MEXICO (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Mexico is the Mexican Peso. There are two exchange markets: the controlled market and the free market. The exchange rates in both markets are adjusted daily, based on the differential between the rates of inflation expected in Mexico and its main trading partners and other indicators that include developments in the terms of trade, levels of exports and imports, movements in foreign exchange reserves, and availabil- ity of external financing. Transactions at the controlled market rate include (a) merchandise export receipts (with some exceptions); (b) payments by in-bond industries for wages, salaries, leasings or rents, and the purchase of Mexican goods and services, other than fixed assets; (c) royalties for the use of foreign technologies and patents; (d) payments of principal, interest, and related expenses resulting from financial and suppliers' credits by the public and private sector; (e) payments for imports; (f) expenses in relation to the Mexican foreign service and contributions regarding Mexico's member- ship in international organizations; and (g) other transac- tions specifically authorized by the Secretariat of Fi- nance and Public Credit and the Bank of Mexico (the central bank). On December 31, 1984 the buying and selling rates in the controlled market were Mex$192.46 and Mex$192.66 per US$1, respectively. With certain exceptions (described below), all other transactions are effected through the free market. Within the free market no limitations apply to the access to, ownership, or transfer of foreign exchange. As of December 31, 1984 the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar in the free market were Mex$209.22 and Mex$210.72 per US$1, respectively. Certain obligations denominated in foreign exchange and payable in Mexico are settled at a special exchange rate established by the Bank of Mexico. The Bank of Mexico, through the Trust Fund for the Coverage of Foreign Exchange Risk (FicoRCA) provides foreign exchange for the repayment of certain foreign debt obligations in respect of debt contracted or re- scheduled on a long-term basis with foreign financial entities and suppliers. All Mexican credit institutions as well as foreign exchange houses are authorized to operate in the free market but cannot intervene in forward transactions for pesos, other than in respect of those approved for banks by the Bank of Mexico under the exchange coverage system. As a temporary measure, the amount of foreign exchange in the free market sold by banks to individuals and enterprises is made subject to prudential limits. No limits exist on the number of transactions that can be effected by any single individual or enterprise. Only the exchange facilities located in international airports or the border area are authorized to sell foreign notes. Mexican credit institutions and foreign exchange houses are free to purchase either currency or documents denominated in foreign exchange. On November 12, 1946, Mexico notified the Fund that it was prepared formally to accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control Foreign exchange policies are established by the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit and the Bank of Mexico. The National Foreign Investment Commission sets policies with regard to direct investment in Mexico by foreigners. The exchange control system is adminis- tered by the Bank of Mexico, with Mexican credit institutions carrying out most of the transactions in the controlled market. The Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Promotion establishes policies with respect to import and export controls and import and export duties, and administers import and export licensing procedures. Prescription of Currency Apart from the exceptions described below there are no obligations prescribing the method or currency for payments to or from nonresidents, neither in the free nor in the controlled market, but obligations deriving from the selling of foreign exchange in the controlled market must be made in the currencies approved by the Bank of Mexico. In accordance with the payments agreements with Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uru- guay, and Venezuela, payments to or from those countries must be made through accounts maintained with each other by the Bank of Mexico and the central bank of the country concerned, w i th in the framework of the multilateral clearing system of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA). Payments to or from Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua in respect of trade and invisible transactions must be settled in U .S. dollars in accordance with a reciprocal credit and payment agreement between the central banks of these countries. Similar arrangements exist with Cuba, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and Yugoslavia. Imports and Import Payments Import licenses from the Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Promotion are required for most of the items in Mexico's General Import Tariff. All imports to free trade and border areas are subject to licensing, with the exception of temporary imports of raw materials and intermediate goods for export production. Applications for import licenses may cover the applicant's import needs of six months. Import needs are estimated at 341 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MEXICO 20 percent above previous actual imports but may be increased when jus t if ied. New licenses are issued only if the applicant can demonstrate that at least 70 percent of earlier licenses have been effectively used. For some commodities "open-end" import licenses may be granted, allowing imports to be effected during a period of six months to one year, subject to an overall limit. Depending on the importer's performance, the license may be renewed repeatedly. Applications for import licenses are screened by the Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Promotion; no licenses are granted for a specified list of luxury goods and products for which there are domestically produced substitutes. Most import licenses are subject to the payment of a fee of between 1 percent and 17 percent of the value of the import transaction; the proceeds are allocated to a fund handled by the Mexican Foreign Trade Institute (IMCE) for the promotion of exports. Official minimum prices are applied to about 25 percent of import items, for the purpose of assessing import duties. Imports by official Mexican agencies are subject to prior approval by the Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Promotion; this approval is not given if a comparable domestic equivalent is available at a price differential not exceeding a range of 15-25 percent. All imports must be accompanied by an exporter's declara- tion of shipment. With the exception of imports included in the tariff negotiation rounds of LAIA countries and temporary imports, imports are subject to an import surcharge of 2 percent ad valorem, the proceeds of which accrue to an export trust fund (FoMEX) established with the Mexican Foreign Trade Bank (BANCOMEXT). Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles are not restricted. The con- tracting of insurance for persons in Mexico, or on property of Mexican ownership, or where the risks are for the account of persons in Mexico or may occur in Mexico, is permitted only with Mexican companies or with foreign companies' branches operating in accor- dance with Mexican law. The payment of principal, interest, and related ex- penses on public and private sector debt with foreign financial entities and Mexican commercial banks can be effected through the controlled market. Payments for the Mexican foreign service and contributions to Mexico's membership to international organizations, as well as payment related to expenses of foreign trade, are effected through the controlled market. Other payments for invisibles can be made through the free market, without limits. Exports and Export Proceeds Certain exports require licenses, and exportation of a few other specified items is prohibited. All merchandise export receipts in excess of Mex$ 1,000 a week are subject to export surrender requirements in the controlled market. Handicraft exports of up to US$8,000 per operation are exempt from the export surrender require- 342 ment. Special procedures apply for the surrender of export proceeds beyond the standard l im it of 90 days. For each day's delay beyond 90 days, Mex$0.05 is discounted from the exchange rate applicable at the time of surrender. If the sale takes place after 120 days from the date of shipment, the applicable exchange rate is that prevailing on the ninetieth day after the shipment. In cases of exceptions authorized by the Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Promotion for surrender of export proceeds for a period of between 90 and 120 days from actual shipment, the discount from the prevailing exchange rate is applicable for the period after the authorized date. Exporters of jewelry and precious metals must surrender their proceeds exclusively through Banca Cremi (a nationalized commercial bank). Export- ing enterprises are authorized to open special accounts in local currency; but only proceeds from exports can be deposited in such accounts. Interest payable on these deposits is equivalent to the rate of depreciation of the controlled exchange rate against the U .S. dollar plus the corresponding Eurodollar deposit rates. Mexican com- mercial banks are also authorized to accept deposits in U .S. dollars by Mexican export enterprises and grant loans in foreign currency for the production, shipment, storage, and long-term financing of exports. Such deposits can only be constituted in foreign currency, cannot be used as demand deposits, and must not earn an interest rate higher than the LIBOR plus 1 percent. Individual deposit accounts under this scheme must be for a minimum of US$5,000, with the exception of deposits made by enterprises in the free trade zones and border areas. Credits to such accounts must be made in U .S. dollars, and repayments are in foreign currency abroad. Exporters are also eligible to purchase imported inputs at the controlled market rate, for amounts at least equivalent to the value of their exports. Prior to obtaining the corresponding import licenses, exporters can use up to 20 percent of their proceeds for the repayment of suppliers' credits outstanding prior to December 20, 1982. Proceeds from Invisibles In-bond industries are required to surrender foreign exchange through the controlled market for the payment of wages, salaries, leasings or rents, taxes, etc., and the purchase of Mexican goods and services other than fixed assets. In-bond industries must effect these foreign exchange transactions through Mexican credit institu- tions. No other exchange control requirements apply to proceeds from invisibles. Capital The Federal Government, other government entities, and companies based in Mexico are required to sell in the controlled market the proceeds of loans obtained from financial institutions abroad or from Mexican credit institutions and repayable abroad. Borrowing agencies and enterprises are exempt from the surrender require- ment only when the loan proceeds are used for the ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution servicing of reported external debt with the approval of the Bank of Mexico, or for import payments authorized by the Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Promo- tion. The servicing of debt contracted after Decem- ber 20, 1982 (including principal, interest, and related expenses) can be effected through the controlled market. The Bank of Mexico provides foreign exchange for the repayment of certain foreign debt obligations through a coverage exchange system. Only long-term debt or debt restructured to cover the long term has access to this facility. In order to have access to the exchange coverage system, all debts with foreign financial institutions must be either registered with the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit or, in the case of suppliers' credits, with the Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Promotion. New foreign direct investment in Mexican banking or insurance companies and investment funds is prohibited. Certain sectors, such as petroleum, basic petrochemical production, radioactive minerals, electricity and nuclear energy, certain mining activities, railroads, telecom- munications, and other activities specified by Mexican laws, are reserved for government investment. Invest- ment in a number of activities is reserved exclusively for Mexican individuals or corporations (radio and televi- sion, the public transportation system, forestry, as well as any other areas specified by the Federal Government), while new investments in other sectors must have a majority participation of Mexican capital, except those cases specifically approved by the National Foreign Investment Commission. Foreign direct investments in Mexico must be registered with the National Foreign Investment Register in the Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Promotion. Applications by foreign indi- viduals or enterprises to acquire more than 25 percent of the capital of a Mexican company require the prior authorization of the National Foreign Investment Com- mission. All acquisitions of stock in Mexican companies by foreigners must be registered within 30 days. Borrow- ing abroad (or within Mexico in foreign currency) by the public sector is subject to approval by the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit. Financial operations in Mexico by foreign financial entities must be made in accordance with guidelines set by the Bank of Mexico and the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit. Peso loans by foreign financial entities to the public and private sectors in Mexico are discouraged. Deposits denominated in foreign currency with Mexican credit institutions are authorized only in special cases. Special accounts denominated in foreign currency can be opened by diplomatic delegations, and by international organiza- tions and their employees, as well as foreign press correspondents. Withdrawals in local currency are made at the free exchange rate. Special compensation accounts opened during the period September 1-December 19, 1982 are maintained subject to the conditions prevailing at the time of the opening of each account, although transactions are effected at current exchange rates. Export companies can open special peso accounts linked to export surrender of MEXICO foreign exchange w i th interest bearing equivalent to the rate of depreciation of the controlled exchange rate against the U .S. dollar, plus the corresponding Eurodol- lar deposit rate. Foreign exchange accounts can also be opened by enterprises in border areas and free trade zones and by in-bond industries. The interest paid on these deposits cannot exceed the Eurodollar sight deposit rates for the period of deposit. Conversion into Mexican pesos is effected at corresponding exchange rates ( i .e ., in-bond industries at the controlled rate for specific purposes and at the free market rate for enterprises in border and free trade zones). Gold Domestic transactions in nonmonetary gold are lim- ited to purchases of gold bars by goldsmiths or manufac- turers effected through authorized Mexican credit institu- tions. Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell monetary gold in Mexico. There is a value-added tax of 15 percent on sales of nonmonetary gold. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement January 16. A new scheme was established under FICORCA to provide forward exchange cover for the external financial obligations of the private sector con- tracted after December 20, 1982. The new "Program for Coverage of Exchange Risks of New Foreign Indebted- ness" would be similar to the previous program which covered obligations contracted up to December 20, 1982 and which expired on October 25, 1983. Thus, FICORCA would not assume the commercial or financial risk of debts contracted by private Mexican enterprises, and the participation of firms would be strictly voluntary. Eligi- ble foreign credits would have a m in imum grace period of four years, but credits with shorter maturities and grace periods could be eligible under exceptional cir- cumstances. The purchase by Mexican firms of ex- change coverage from FICORCA, including both principal and interest, would be financed by a credit from FICORCA for the local currency equivalent of the foreign debt, converted at the controlled market exchange rate in effect on the date of the transaction. January 27. The Secretariat of Commerce and Indus- trial Promotion announced that all items subject to import du ty would be eligible for imports under the controlled market exchange rate. Settlements for related foreign payments, as well as conversion of credits obtained from foreign suppliers, would also be effected at the controlled market rate; but temporary imports would be eligible for th is provision only under special authorization. July 19. Foreign exchange settlements in respect of royalty payments for the use of foreign technologies and patents were shifted from the free to the controlled exchange market, provided that the technology transfer contracts were registered w i th the Secretariat of Com- merce and Industrial Promotion. Changes were also 343 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MEXICO made in exchange control regulations applicable to imports of precious metals used as inputs for exports of jewelry. Imports and Import Payments January 4. Import tariffs were modified for 214 different items, comprising 124 reductions and 90 increases in tariff rates. January 27. The Secretariat of Commerce and Indus- trial Promotion announced that all items subject to import duty would be eligible for foreign exchange under the controlled market exchange rate. Related foreign payments as well as credits obtained from foreign suppliers would also be effected at the controlled market rate; but temporary imports would be eligible for this provision only under special authorization. February 1. The Secretariat of Commerce and Indus- trial Promotion established official import prices for several tariff items. (The list of items covered by this regime was extended by the Secretariat on March 15, 1984.) February 6. The Secretariat of Commerce and Indus- trial Promotion announced regulations for the issuance of automatic import permits for 262 different essential items not produced locally; permits could be issued covering import needs of up to one year, with a validity of six months, and entitling beneficiaries to effect imports at the controlled market exchange rate. Applica- tions for permits were to be processed within ten working days of their submission. April 13. Import tariffs were modified for 18 different items, in the form of 10 reductions and 8 increases in tariff rates. April 16. The Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Promotion exempted an additional 261 tariff items from prior import permits. July 13. Import tariffs were modified for 72 different items, in the form of 41 reductions and 31 increases in tariff rates. July 17. Changes were made as follows in the guidelines for the issuance of import permits: (a) the validity of permits was extended from six to nine months (twelve months in the case of capital goods with extended delivery dates); (b) permits would cover the applicant's import needs for six months, with import needs to be estimated on the basis of previous actual imports plus a margin of 20 percent, subject to an increase when justified; (c) new import permits would only be issued if the applicant could demonstrate that 70 percent of earlier issues of permits had been effec- tively used, but permits would be granted liberally for imports of up to US$30,000; and (d) the list of tariff items for which import permits would be automatically denied was reduced from 1,843 to 544 items, comprising luxury items. In addition, legislation was introduced consolidating existing guidelines on temporary imports of intermediate inputs for export activities. (Since May 2, 1983, virtually all imports under this regime had been exempted from import permits.) 344 July 19. Foreign exchange financing in respect of royalty payments for the use of foreign technologies and patents was shifted from the free to the controlled exchange market, provided that the technology transfer contracts were registered w i th the Secretariat of Com- merce and Industrial Promotion. Modifications were also made in the exchange control regulations applying to imports of precious metals used as inputs for exports of jewelry. August 2. Import permit exemptions were announced for 26 different tariff items covering domestically pro- duced inputs, in order to avoid oligopolistic markups in relation to world prices. August 7. The number of tariff items eligible for automatic import permits was reduced from 261 to 135 items, as a result of adding 54 items to the list and exempting 180 items from import permits. In addition, cotton was exempted both from prior import and export permits. August 20. Import permit exemptions were announced for 827 tariff items covering intermediate and capital goods not produced locally and for which no import substitution was envisaged, bringing the number of items exempted from permits to 2,816, or about 15 percent of overall import value in 1983. Imports of less than US$100 per item under any tariff item or US$500 per import operation were also exempted from import permits. In addition, import tariffs were modified for 526 tariff items (136 reductions and 390 increases in tariff rates), with a view to rationalizing effective protection and reducing tariff dispersion. August 22. Import tariffs were modified for 42 different items, in the form of 38 reductions and 4 increases in tariff rates. September 24. Import tariffs were modified for 139 different items, in the form of 128 reductions and 11 increases in tariff rates. October 31. The system of import permits was extended through 1984—85, in accordance with the following schedule: (a) For 727 tariff items (about 10 percent of 1983 imports), including intermediate goods of a small value added, the system was extended through October 31, 1985; (b) for 3,500 tariff items (about 35 percent of 1983 imports), including inter- mediate goods with a higher degree of elaboration, capital goods produced locally, and certain consumer goods, the system was extended through October 31, 1986; (c) for 965 tariff items (about 37 percent of 1983 imports) including less essential consumer goods, food products, commodities subject to international agree 7 ment (coffee, sugar, and cocoa), pesticides, herbicides, and drugs for human consumption, the system was extended through October 31, 1989. A total of 2,828 tariff items (about 18 percent of 1983 imports) thus remained exempt from import permits. November 7. It was announced that exporters could deduct from the surrender requirement of export receipts a certain percentage of direct costs associated with imports required for the export process. Such deductions ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution would be routinely allowed up to a total of 8 percent of the import value (6 percent for imports from North America); in the case of deductions up to 5 percent of the import value (4 percent for imports from North America), no documentation would be required other than keeping the relevant records for five years. Deduc- tions above the stated limits were made subject to authorization by the Mexican Foreign Trade Institute (IMCE). Payments for Invisibles July 19. Foreign exchange financing in respect of royalty payments for the use of foreign technologies and patents was shifted from the free to the controlled exchange market, provided that the technology transfer contracts were registered with the Secretariat of Com- merce and Industrial Promotion. Modifications were also made in the exchange control regulations applying to imports of precious metals used as inputs for exports of jewelery. Exports and Export Proceeds February 22. The Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Promotion established official export prices for several items that were subject to export taxes, and the coverage of such items was extended by a decree of the Secretariat on March 19. March 1. The limit on the surrender period for exports effected through the controlled exchange market was increased from 30 days to 75 days, in order to allow Mexican exporters to offer more attractive payment terms to foreign customers. For each day's delay beyond 75 days, Mex$0.05 would be discounted from the exchange rate applicable at the time of surrender, but if the same was concluded after 120 days from the date of shipment (90 days under the earlier regulations), the applicable exchange rate would be that prevailing on the seventy-fifth day after shipment. In addition, exporters would be allowed to increase from 50 to 100 percent the share of export receipts which could be used to settle private obligations to foreign suppliers contracted before December 20, 1982. July 17. Legislation was introduced consolidating existing guidelines on temporary imports of intermediate inputs for export activities. (Since May 2, 1983, virtu- ally all imports under this regime had been exempted from import permits.) November 7. The following modifications were made in exchange control regulations: (a) the standard limit on the time period for surrender of export proceeds was increased from 75 to 90 days; for each day's delay beyond 90 days, Mex$0.05 would be discounted from the exchange rate applicable at the time of surrender, except that if sale was concluded after 120 days from the date of shipment, the applicable exchange rate would be the one prevailing on the ninetieth day after the ship- ment; (b) exporters were authorized to use export receipts to repay principal and interest on debt contracted after December 20, 1982 w i th foreign financial institu- MEXICO tions or w i th foreign branches of Mexican banks, as well as to repay interest on debt contracted with such creditors before December 20, 1982; (c) exporters of jewelry and precious metals were directed to surrender their export receipts exclusively through Banca Cremi; (d) in a simplification of procedures for deductions of direct outlays related to exports from the surrender requirement of export receipts, it was announced that such deductions would be routinely allowed up to a total of 15 percent of export receipts (12 percent for exports to North America), and that, in the case of deductions of up to 9 percent of export receipts (7 percent for exports to North America), no documentation would be required other than keeping the relevant records for 5 years, but deductions in the form of commissions could not exceed 5 percent of the f .o .b. value of the merchandise, and those above 15 percent of export receipts were made subject to authorization by the IMCE; (e) exporters could deduct from the surrender requirement of export receipts a certain percentage of direct costs associated w i th imports required for the export process; such deductions would be routinely allowed up to a total of 8 percent of the import value (6 percent for imports from North America), except that in the case of deductions of up to 5 percent of import value (4 percent for imports from North America), no documentation would be required other than keeping the relevant records for five years, but deductions above the stated limits would be subject to authorization by the IMCE; and (f) settlements in respect of merchandise exports valued under US$1,000 a week (US$8,000 in the case of handicrafts) were excluded from the controlled exchange market. Capital January 13. In regard to the repayment schedule under the scheme covering the settlement of private sector obligations with foreign suppliers, the Bank of Mexico announced that firms would have access to foreign exchange for repayment of principal due in 1984 related to obligations contracted before December 20, 1982. For obligations due through the end of 1983, the deadline to constitute deposits under the 1983 program was extended from January 13 to February 15, 1984. Deposits made between January 14 and February 15, 1984 would be repaid on the f i f th working day of March 1984. January 16. A new scheme was instituted under FICORCA to provide forward exchange cover for external financial obligations of the private sector contracted after December 20, 1982. The new "Program for Coverage of Exchange Risks of New Foreign Indebtedness" would be similar to the previous program wh ich covered obliga- tions contracted up to December 20, 1982, and which expired on October 25, 1983. FICORCA would assume neither the commercial nor f inanc ial risk of debts contracted by private Mexican enterprises, and the participation of firms would be strictly voluntary. Eligi- ble foreign credits would have a m in imum grace period of four years, but credits w i th shorter maturities and 345 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MEXICO grace periods could be eligible under exceptional cir- cumstances. The purchase by Mexican firms of ex- change coverage from FICORCA, including for principal and interest, would be financed by a credit from FICORCA for the local currency equivalent of the foreign debt, converted at the controlled market exchange rate on the date of the transaction. February 17. The National Commission on Foreign Investment announced a list of priority sectors where majority foreign ownership would be authorized (as a rule, foreign ownership was limited to 49 percent of capital). The list included electrical and nonelectrical machinery, metal-mechanic industry, electronics, trans- portation material, chemicals, certain other industrial sectors, biotechnology, and hotels. Priority would also be given to investments in other sectoral activity directed to the export market. November 7. As part of the new exchange control regulations, new guidelines were issued as follows on registration of private sector foreign debt with the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit: (a) registration would have to be made semiannually —between Jan- uary 1 and March 31 for the stock of debt outstanding at the end of the previous year, and between Ju ly 1 and September 30 for the stock outstanding at the end of the previous semester; the required documentation should indicate the unpaid balance of the debt, the fu ture amortization schedule, and the portion (if any) of the debt guaranteed by an official foreign agency; and (b) exporters were authorized to use export receipts to repay principal and interest on debt contracted after December 20, 1982 with foreign financial institutions or with foreign branches of Mexican banks, as well as to repay interest on debt contracted with these creditors before December 20, 1982. Gold November 7. Exporters of jewelry and precious metals were directed to surrender their export receipts exclu- sively through Banca Cremi. 346 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MOROCCO (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Morocco is the Moroccan Dirham. The Bank of Morocco fixes buying and selling rates for the French franc daily on the basis of variations in the value of the currencies of Morocco's principal trading partners, weighted in accordance with the geographic distribution of Morocco's foreign trade and the pattern of currencies of settlement. Buying and selling rates for most other currencies quoted in Morocco1 are estab- lished on the basis of the daily dirham-French franc rate and the cross rates for those currencies in relation to the French franc in the Paris exchange market. On Decem- ber 30, 1984 the exchange rate for the French franc was DH 0.99426 buying and DH 0.99724 selling per F 1. On the same date, the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar was fixed at DH 9.5314 buying and DH 9.5710 selling per US$1. A special premium, called the "fidelity premium," is paid by the banks on remittances by Moroccans working abroad. The value of the premium, which varies from bank to bank, depends on the foreign currencies con- cerned and on changes in the exchange rate of the dirham in relation to such currencies. All sales and purchases of foreign currency are centralized in the Bank of Morocco, but the authorized banks are permitted to offset purchases and sales on behalf of private customers in each currency separately. Each day authorized banks must purchase from or sell to the Bank of Morocco the balances of their purchases and sales in each currency; transactions are effected at rates fixed by the Bank. Compensation between banks is not permitted so that no foreign exchange market exists in Morocco. The Bank of Morocco also establishes buying and selling rates for transactions with travelers in bank notes, traveler's checks, and letters of credit denomi- nated in "convertible currencies" (the currencies listed in footnote 1, including the French franc but excluding the Tunisian dinar) and specified other currencies;2 the authorized banks sell to the Bank of Morocco their excess holdings of bank notes and replenish them at the Bank when necessary. A forward foreign exchange cover facility was established by the authorities effective June 1, 1979; the facility is available for exports as well as imports of items benefiting from special customs arrangements. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Exchange Office, an agency under the Ministry of Finance. This 'Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Kuwa i ti dinars, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Saudi Arabian riyals, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, Tunisian dinars, U .A .E. dirhams, and U.S. dollars. 2CFA francs, Finnish markkaa, Gibraltar pounds, and Lebanese pounds. Office has delegated the execution of certain exchange control measures to authorized banks. Import certificates and export licenses are issued by the Ministry of Commerce; they must be countersigned by the Exchange Office. Import commitments for liberalized goods are signed by the importer himself; they do not require the visa of the Exchange Office unless the country of origin of the goods is not the country of shipment, or the goods are bought on a c . i .f. basis. A part of the port of Tangier is designated as a free trade zone and is exempt from taxation and from trade, customs, and exchange controls. Prescription of Currency For prescription of currency purposes, countries are classified as follows: (1) the payments agreement group, comprising countries with which Morocco maintains bilateral payments agreements;3 and (2) all other coun- tries, the "area of convertibility." Certain noncommercial settlements with Algeria are made in dirhams or Algerian dinars through special accounts at the two central banks; all settlements with Tunisia are made through accounts denominated in convertible dirhams or Tunisian convertible dinars, and all settlements with Mauritania are made through ac- counts denominated in convertible dirhams or convert- ible Mauritanian ouguiyas. Imports originating in coun- tries in the area of convertibility may be paid for only in "convertible currencies" negotiated by the Bank of Morocco. Other settlements with countries in the area of convertibility may be made only in convertible curren- cies negotiated by the Bank of Morocco or through Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dirhams. Nonresident Accounts The various types of nonresident accounts are as follows: 1. Foreign Currency Accounts are held by physical or juridical foreign nationals, either resident or nonresident. These may be freely credited with book transfers from abroad, with checks, traveler's checks, or any other means of payment denominated in foreign currency, except foreign bank notes, and with foreign currency drawn from the Bank of Morocco following general or special authorization by the Exchange Office. They may be freely debited for book transfers abroad to the account holder or to a third party foreign national, for the surrender of foreign currency to the Bank of Morocco, or for the payment of checks denominated in foreign currency. 2. Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dirhams are reserved for physical or juridical persons of foreign nationality, who may be resident or nonresident. These Guinea and Mali; however, these agreements are inoperative. 347 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MOROCCO accounts may be credited freely with authorized pay- ments due to residents of countries in the area of convertibility and with dirhams obtained from the sale to the Bank of Morocco of convertible currencies, exclud- ing bank notes.4 They may be debited freely for payments in Morocco and for purchases from the Bank of Morocco of convertible currencies. Transfers between Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dirhams may be made freely. The interest rate payable on these deposits may not exceed 10 percent a year and is not subject to the withholding tax of 10 percent on interest earnings. 3. Payments Agreement Accounts are held by the Bank of Morocco for central banks (or similar institutions) of the countries with which Morocco maintains bilateral payments agreements (see footnote 3); they are used only for settlements with these countries, including set- tlements for imports and exports. 4. Capital Accounts, which may be held by any nonresident, are credited with funds that may not be transferred abroad. These include the proceeds from the sale on the Casablanca Stock Exchange of foreign or Moroccan securities without retransfer guarantees and proceeds from the contractual or accelerated redemption of securities quoted on the Casablanca Stock Exchange and lacking retransfer guarantees. Transfers between Capital Accounts related to countries in the area of convertibility or the same country in the payments agreement group are permitted freely. Capital Accounts may be debited freely for purchases of specified govern- ment bonds and for personal expenses of the account holder and his immediate relatives during visits to Morocco (subject to a limit of DH 15,000 a year for each account), as well as the settlement of taxes in Morocco owed by the account holder. All other operations through Capital Accounts require individual approval. 5. Suspense Accounts are used for holding nonresident funds not available for credit to any of the accounts mentioned above. Balances on these accounts may be used freely to pay taxes due in Morocco, and, up to DH 15,000 a year, to pay the costs of the stay in Morocco of the account holder, the spouse, or other immediate relatives, but all other debits to these accounts require approval. 6. Three Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dirhams are held by the Bank of Morocco for the Central Bank of Algeria, the Central Bank of Mauritania, and the Central Bank of Tunisia. Only certain noncommercial transac- tions between Morocco and Algeria are settled through the account opened in the name of the Central Bank of Algeria. Imports and Import Payments Imports are admitted in accordance with an annual General Import Program, divided into three categories and applicable to all countries. Goods in List A may be 4The Exchange Office may, however, authorize a foreign account to be credited in convertible dirhams with the dirham proceeds from the surrender of foreign bank notes, upon presentation of the original customs declaration. 348 imported freely. Goods in List B are restricted, in some cases by a global quota, or are subject to state trading; for a large number of List B items, no quotas are established, and imports are approved according to need, licenses usually being issued upon application (SB items). In principle, the importation of goods in List C is not permitted; among the items on this list are certain motor vehicles, certain precious metals, and gold jewelry. To import goods in List A, the importer signs an import commitment (engagement a" importation), which does not require administrative approval unless the goods are imported from a country other than that of origin or are purchased on a c . i . f. basis,5 but for goods in List B, an import certificate (autorisation a"importa- tion or certificat a"'importation) must be obtained. Cereals, sugar, tea, and fertilizers are imported by official agencies. For all imports the import title —import certificate or import commitment —must be domiciled (registered) with an authorized bank, which may make payments upon submission of the required documents. Import certificates require the visa of the Exchange Office before the foreign exchange is made available. Import commitments require this visa only when the country of origin and the country of shipment of the goods concerned d iffer or when imports are contracted for on a c . i . f. basis. Special procedures are applicable to specified imports financed by foreign aid or loans. At the time the import transaction is domiciled with an autho- rized bank, a stamp du ty of DH 50 is levied on import transactions valued at DH 2,000 or more. Most imports from countries in the payments agree- ment group are made in accordance with quotas estab- lished in the respective trade agreements. Imports can also be licensed under compensation transactions. Payments for Invisibles Payments for most current invisibles require the approval of the Exchange Office, but in several instances the approval authority has been delegated to the banks. The authorized banks are permitted to make payments and settle expenses incidental to the commercial transac- tion covered by the relevant import or export documents. Earnings after tax on approved nonresident investments in Morocco are transferable to the investor's country of residence. The transfer of dividends on nonresident- owned shares of Moroccan companies having their main office in Morocco requires the approval of the Exchange Office. Undistributed profits relating to the financial year 1968 or later remain transferable indefinitely. Some payments are subject to limitations. A foreign employee may transfer to the employee's country of origin, subject to the initial approval of the Exchange Office, 50 percent of his monthly wages or salary if the spouse does not reside in Morocco, or 30 percent if the employee is single or his fam i ly lives in Morocco; 5C . i . f. imports of List A goods require prior exchange control approval. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution teachers attached to the Ministry of National Education are allowed an additional transfer of 35 percent for 30 days' leave taken abroad, of 70 percent for a 60 days' leave, and of 105 percent for 70 days' leave. For the medical or paramedical professions, the assessment of transferable amounts (30 percent or 50 percent, accord- ing to whether the spouse lives in Morocco) is based on taxable income minus applicable duties and taxes. The same applies to other liberal professions as well as to persons engaged in industry, trade, agriculture, and crafts, except that the monthly transferable amount may not exceed DH 2,000. For retired persons the calculation of the transferable amount (30 percent or 50 percent) is based on net pensions. An allocation of foreign exchange equivalent to DH 100 a person a year is granted to residents of any nationality for travel abroad, provided that they do not make periodic transfers abroad. There is a special allocation for pilgrimages. Residents of foreign nationality may acquire exchange for tourist travel up to the equivalent of DH 2,500 a year for each passport by selling to an authorized bank a corresponding amount in foreign exchange (other than bank notes) from their own foreign assets not subject to surrender requirements. A special tax of DH 100 a person is levied on Moroccan nationals traveling abroad, with the exception of pilgrims, students, emigrant workers, and those traveling on official business. For business travel a standard allowance of DH 500 a day is granted for executives and DH 350 a day for other staff members and employees, up to DH 5,000 a person a trip and within an annual ceiling fixed individually by the Exchange Office; exporters and professional members of the tourist industry may obtain up to DH 1,000 a person a day, up to DH 15,000 a trip, within a ceiling of 3 per- cent of the foreign exchange repatriated during the preceding calendar year. The allocation issued for business travel may be added to the allocation issued for tourist travel. Moroccan students pursuing higher studies at the first and second level abroad who do not hold scholarships may obtain monthly allocations of foreign exchange up to a maximum of DH 2,000, and doctoral students who do not hold scholarships may obtain up to DH 2,200. There is also a quarterly allocation of DH 3,000 as a supplement for scholarship students. Students are granted an annual installation allowance fixed at DH 4,000. The export of Moroccan bank notes is prohibited. Workers leaving Morocco to work abroad for the first time may be granted DH 2,000 in foreign bank notes upon presentation of an employment contract. Exports and Export Proceeds Most exports may be made freely, although export licenses are required for a few items. All fru i ts, fresh vegetables, raw cotton, and cotton by-products may be exported only by a state-trading agency, the Office of Marketing and Export (Office de Commercialisation et d'Exportation —OCE), which is also in charge of wine exports. MOROCCO All exporters must sign an undertaking to repatriate and surrender foreign exchange proceeds. The surrender to the exporter's bank must take place within one month from the date the payment is due. The date on which the payment is due is the maturity date fixed in the commercial contract; in principle, this date must not be set more than 90 days after the date of arrival of the merchandise at the place of destination. When the exporter's bank receives the advice of credit in foreign currency from abroad, it must surrender the foreign exchange immediately to the Bank of Morocco. Proceeds from Invisibles Residents of Moroccan nationality and Moroccan companies must repatriate exchange receipts accruing from all their noncommercial claims and surrender them to an authorized bank. Other residents must surrender noncommercial receipts only if the receipts result from current transactions. Moroccans working abroad must surrender such currencies within one month of re-entry, but are permitted, when leaving again, to repurchase 15 percent of the amount surrendered. A special pre- mium, called the "fidelity premium," is paid by the banks on remittances by Moroccans working abroad. The importation of Moroccan bank notes is prohibited. Nonresident travelers may freely bring in foreign bank notes and traveler's checks; foreign currency imported in excess of the equivalent of DH 5,000 must, however, be declared to the customs authorities. Resident travelers also may bring in foreign bank notes in any amount, but these must be surrendered within 30 days of re-entry. Capital Residents of Moroccan nationality, as well as compa- nies established in Morocco, are obliged to declare to the Exchange Office all foreign-held assets exceeding DH 250 and to repatriate and surrender certain of these assets. The disposal of other foreign-held assets requires permission. The transfer of capital abroad by residents must be approved. Remittance of the assets of emigrants and transfers in the form of gifts are not normally approved, nor is investment by private individuals in foreign securities or real estate. Exchange allocations for the transfer of inheritances are limited to DH 35,000 a beneficiary. Permissible transfers of assets by resident foreigners on final departure vary with the length of stay, from DH 10,000 a year for a stay of up to 9 years, DH 150,000 for a stay of 10 to 14 years, DH 250,000 for 15 to 24 years of stay, and DH 350,000 when the period of residence exceeds 24 years. Also for departing resident foreigners, capital accounts with a balance on December 31, 1980 of not more than DH 20,000 are fu l ly transferable, and suspense accounts with a balance on February 6, 1981 not exceeding DH 10,000 are fu l ly transferable, provided that the bank furnished the Ex- change Office with supporting information on the ac- counts by June 30, 1981. A new industrial investment code, which came into force in February 1983, provides for fu ll foreign owner- 349 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MOROCCO ship of Moroccan companies, and an easing of repatria- tion of capital; it also grants fiscal and other incentives for foreign investment. In addition, an investment code introduced for the tourist sector in August 1983 offers tax and other incentives to domestic and foreign inves- tors on most arrears in the tourist sector; it also provides for full repatriation of tourist-related profits after tax, without any restraint on timing. Operations through Capital Accounts that may be effected with approval include purchases on the Casa- blanca Stock Exchange of Moroccan and non-Moroccan securities; purchases of Moroccan securities not quoted on the Casablanca Stock Exchange or participation in a Moroccan firm; subscriptions to either; investments of any kind, including purchases of businesses or office buildings; lending to residents; payment of local ex- penses in excess of DH 15,000 during the account holder's stay in Morocco; any such payments to be- neficiaries other than the holder of the account or a close relative; any such payments from an account held by a foreign juridical person; gifts to social, cultural, or religious institutions; subscriptions to capital increases of Moroccan companies whose shares are quoted on the Casablanca Stock Exchange; subscriptions at the time of issue to long-term or short-term fixed yield securities issued by a Moroccan public entity; custody charges and commissions on securities; and payment of the cost of maintenance, repairs, real estate taxes, and insurance on real estate located in Morocco. Subject to approval, Capital Accounts may also be debited for investments in Morocco, within the framework of the 1973 Investment Code, provided that the amounts debited do not exceed 50 percent of the investment undertaken by the nonresi- dent and 25 percent of the company's total capital. Certain government bonds acquired with funds from Capital Accounts are freely negotiable between nonresi- dents. These are 5.5 percent, seven-year bonds and 6 percent, five-year bonds on which interest and redemp- tion proceeds are transferable. All other transactions in securities involving nonresident interests, as well as the import and export of securities, require approval. Banks are permitted to engage in short-term borrowing abroad; they may accept convertible currency funds from nonres- idents for credit to Special Deposit Accounts, provided that these funds are reinvested abroad in the same currency and for the same maturity period. The rate of interest paid by banks on these deposits may not exceed the rate received by them on their corresponding placements. Gold Commemorative gold coins with a face value of DH 250 and DH 500 have been issued and are legal tender. Residents may purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in Morocco for numismatic or investment pur- poses. Ten different types of foreign gold coins are 350 traded on the Casablanca Stock Exchange, which does not, however, deal in gold bars. Imports of gold are subject to authorization by the Directorate of Customs and Indirect Taxes. Each year the Ministry of Finance fixes a quota for the importation of gold ingots, which is then allocated among jewelers and industrial users of precious metals. Gold jewelry is included in import List C. Exports of gold are prohibited. Changes During 1984 Imports and Import Payments January 9.

Not for Redistribution MOZAMBIQUE (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Mozambique is the Mozambique Metical, which is pegged to a weighted basket of six currencies representing the bulk of the country's external transactions. The exchange rate of the metical in terms of the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is fixed daily on the basis of quotations for the U .S. dollar and the other currencies in the basket. Exchange rates for 20 other currenciesl are also published daily by the Bank of Mozambique. Buying and selling rates are set such that the spread between the buying and the selling rate is 2 percent. On December 31, 1984, the buying and selling rates for telegraphic transfers in U .S. dollars were Mt. 43.549 and Mt. 44.415, respectively, per US$1. A special buying rate of Mt. 40 per rand is applicable to South African rand receipts from Mozambican miners working in South Africa. With this exception, there are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control With the assistance of State Central and provincial agencies, the National Planning Commission prepares annually a foreign exchange budget for the following year, as part of the Central State Plan. All imports and exports are granted within limits established in the foreign exchange budget. Foreign exchange transac- tions, including the surrender of foreign exchange proceeds, are effected through the Bank of Mozambique. Prescription of Currency Mozambique has bilateral payments agreements with Tanzania and the German Democratic Republic. Nonresident Accounts Foreigners living in Mozambique can hold foreign exchange accounts in the Bank of Mozambique and national currency accounts in any bank operating in the country. There is no restriction on the use of these accounts. Ex-residents (foreigners who no longer enjoy residency status) may hold bank accounts in Mozam- bique but their use is subject to prior authorization, in accordance with Ministry of Finance regulations; draw- ings may be made by the holders of such accounts for payment of taxes or expenses while visiting the country. Imports and Import Licensing All imports are subject to licensing. Certain goods, such as equipment, agro-chemicals, cereals, and textiles are, in principle, imported through specialized state 'Austrian schilling, Belgian franc, Canadian dollar, Danish krone, deutsche mark, Finnish markka, French franc, Italian lira, Japanese yen, Malawi kwacha, Netherlands guilder, Norwegian krone, Portu- gese excudo, pound sterling, South African rand, Spanish peseta, Swedish krona, Swiss franc, Zambian kwacha, and Zimbabwe dollar. enterprises. State enterprises can license themselves for transactions within the scope of their activities as defined in the Central State Plan. Licenses for other enterprises are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The import license specifies the country of origin and amount and currency of payment. Individuals may obtain import licenses within certain limits, for customs clearance purposes only, when drawing on the country's Foreign Exchange Fund is not involved. Imports of food, medicines, raw materials, parts and spare parts, and petroleum are given priority. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles are processed by the Bank of Mozambique upon presentation of the authorization granted by the Ministry of Finance. Travel allocations are made available to individuals only for medical reasons. Each Ministry receives an allocation to be used for business travel and educational travel expenses. Foreigners working in Mozambique may remit abroad from 35 percent to 50 percent of their salaries depending on the salary level. Nonresidents may export foreign bank notes up to the amount declared on entry. Exports and reimports of domestic currency are limited to Mt. 500 a person leaving the country temporarily, to meet incidental expenses on returning. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports are subject to licensing. Licenses are granted if they conform to legal and Plan requirements. Certain products such as cashew nu ts, coal, citrus, cotton, molasses, and sugar are required to be exported by specific state enterprises. Under a new foreign exchange administration system, enterprises or sectors may retain a variable percentage of their foreign ex- change proceeds for their import purchases. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles must be surrendered to the Central Bank. A special rate of Mt. 40 per rand is applicable to purchases of rands from Mozambican miners working in South Africa. Capital The Government and the Bank of Mozambique are authorized to borrow abroad. All resources obtained from abroad are channeled through the Bank of Mozam- bique. There is a Foreign Investment Law that aims to encourage the participation of foreign capital in the formation of new enterprises or in investments in existing enterprises in the form of foreign ownership, joint venture, or national ownership. The Foreign Invest- ment Law instituted a Foreign Investment Promotion Office in the National Planning Commission. The guarantees provided to investors under this Law include protection against nationalization as well as the right to 351 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MOZAMBIQUE transfer a portion of profits and invested capital abroad. The incentives for foreign investments include tax and customs exemptions for specified periods of time and access to domestic credit. Gold There are no legal limitations on gold acquisitions. Holdings of gold jewelry or other precious metals are governed by special regulations. Exports and Export Proceeds March 26. Mozambique and Tanzania agreed to establish the Rovuma Free Trade Area (RUFTA); in this context, the two countries agreed on a trade protocol for 1984-85. May 15.

Not for Redistribution NEPAL (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Nepal is the Nepalese Rupee, which is pegged to a trade-weighted basket of currencies. On December 31, 1984 the official buying and selling rates were NRs 17.90 and NRs 18.10, respectively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates are quoted daily for certain other currencies,1 with quotations based on the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar in markets abroad. Buying rates only are quoted for Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Italian lire, and Swedish kroner, based on buying rates for the U .S. dollar in markets abroad. Residents may freely purchase Indian rupees from Nepalese banks, and they may hold any amount of Indian notes and coin, but the Indian rupee is not legal tender. Administration of Control Permission is required from the Ministry of Finance for all payments in convertible currency except for import payments and certain other specified payments. Import and export licensing is the responsibility of the Ministry of Commerce and Supply. All exchange trans- actions with countries other than India must be settled through authorized dealers, that is, the Nepal Bank Ltd. and the Rastriya Banijya Bank, which has 313 branches. Within Nepal there are 145 additional authorized dealers licensed to purchase foreign currencies; any sale of such currencies other than Indian rupees is subject to the prior approval of the Nepal Rastra Bank. Prescription of Currency No prescription of currency requirements apply to outgoing payments to countries with which no payments agreement is in force,2 and these may be made in foreign currency supplied by the Nepal Rastra Bank. Payments to, and receipts from, other member countries of the Asian Clearing Union (ACU) except India (Bangladesh, Burma, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) in respect of current transactions (other than those relating to petroleum, natural gas, their products, and government transactions) should be effected through the ACU. Payments for imports from India normally are settled in Indian rupees, but the Nepal Rastra Bank sometimes makes convertible currencies available for such imports on the recommendation of the Ministry of Finance. The proceeds of exports to India are obtained in Indian rupees, while proceeds from other countries must be received in any of the quoted convertible currencies. 'Aus tra l ian dollars, Canadian dollars, deutsche mark, French francs, Indian rupees, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, Singapore dollars, and Asian Monetary Un i ts (AMUs). 2Nepal has bilateral payments agreements w i th Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, and the U .S .S .R .; payments for transactions under the agreement with Poland must be made through special accounts. Nonresident Accounts The Nepal Rastra Bank permits nonresidents to open "convertible rupee accounts" with Nepalese banks; bal- ances on these accounts may be freely transferred abroad. Accounts in Indian currency may be opened only under special arrangements. Foreign currencies brought into or received in Nepal by nonresidents, which are converted into Nepalese rupees and deposited with a Nepalese bank, may be reconverted for transfer out of the country, subject to prior permission of the Nepal Rastra Bank. Imports and Import Payments Imports from India do not require import licenses. All other imports of goods require import licenses. Imports of vegetable oil, margarine, animal fat, woolen carpets, arms and ammunition, explosives, chemicals to be used for explosives, and wireless transmitters require special permission of the Government. Imports of beef are banned as are imports of washing soap (except from India) and detergent powder. Under the Trade and Transit Treaties, Nepal and India have agreed to freedom of trade between themselves in Nepalese and Indian goods; Indian goods may, in principle, be imported freely (although some are subject to a permit system in order to prevent their re-exportation and certain others are subject to export ceilings in India); reimbursement of tax is made by the Government of India to the Govern- ment of Nepal on direct imports from Indian manufactur- ers of commodities subject to excise duty in India. Imports of certain commodities (e.g., fertilizers, ce- ment, petrol, diesel, bitumen, jute patching oil, raw wool, cotton, industrial machinery, stainless steel, wrist watches, synthetic yarn, radios, pocket calculators, video sets, photographic equipment, and other specified goods) from countries other than India are subject to quantitative restrictions. License fees are imposed as follows: imports of certain items subject to quotas (including fertilizers, cement, certain petroleum products, raw wool, cotton, and industrial machinery) are subject to a fee of 1 percent of import license value. Fees of 5 percent, 10 percent, and 25 percent are required for other industrial and construction materials, essential consumer goods, and luxury items, respectively. Margin deposits are required on import letters of credit for commercial imports; the deposit requirement is 100 percent, except for cement, iron rods, corrugated sheets, and other specified indus- trial raw materials and industrial inputs, to which a lower rate of 30 percent applies. Nepalese citizens returning from abroad are allowed to import without license personal effects valued from NRs 3,000 to NRs 13,000 once a year, depending on the duration of their stay abroad. Customs du ty of NRs 1,000-3,000 and sales tax of NRs 400-1,200 are 353 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NEPAL exempted on such goods. Children under 16 years are allowed to import duty free about half the amount allowed for adults. Similarly, Nepalese citizens can bring in one set of gold or silver or jewel-studded ornaments worth NRs 8,000 a year. They are required to show authorized foreign exchange sources for all the goods brought in by them. All import settlements through the banking system must be on a letter of credit basis; only imports from India may be settled outside the banking system. Certain imports from all sources are subject to import surcharges. Payments for Invisibles Payments to India may be made freely in Indian rupees, but for amounts of NRs 500 or more, the purpose of the payment must be declared. For travel to countries other than India for medical treatment, foreign exchange is allowed as recommended by a panel of doctors; students studying at their own expense in these countries are allowed up to US$2,160 a year for board and lodging, while payments for tuition fees are allowed as required. Foreign exchange is made available for certain business trips but is restricted for tourist travel abroad. Payments for other invisibles depend on the essentiality of the transaction and the availability of foreign exchange. Nepalese and Indian currencies may be taken out freely to India but only by Nepalese and Indian nationals; the export of these currencies to countries other than India is prohibited. Foreign bank notes, other than Indian bank notes, may not be taken out by residents without permission. Nonresidents may take out the unchanged amount of any foreign bank notes they brought in; however, nonresi- dents, other than Indian nationals, may not take out Nepalese or Indian bank notes.

A 10 percent cash incentive on f .o .b. border customs value is provided for exports to countries other than India, except for leather and leather goods, for which the cash incentive ranges between 10 percent and 20 per- cent. Refunds are also provided on customs duties and sales taxes levied on imported inputs (raw materials, 354 chemical ingredients, etc.) directly used in the produc- tion of exports. In addition, a concessional export credit rate is provided for exports to countries other than India. The exchange proceeds from exports, except Indian rupees, must be surrendered to the Nepal Rastra Bank or to an authorized bank within six months of the date when the goods crossed the customs frontier. Unit values are defined on an f .o .b. Nepal basis. Foreign or Nepalese tourists may take out as sou- venirs, without permission, goods not exceeding NRs 15,000 in value, which are not otherwise restricted. Proceeds from Invisibles With the exception of Indian rupees, foreign exchange proceeds derived from transactions in invisibles must be surrendered to the Nepal Rastra Bank or an authorized bank at the official rate of exchange. Nepalese and Indian currency may be brought in from India only, and by Nepalese and Indian nationals only; the import of these currencies from countries other than India is prohibited. When extending their visas, tourists are required to produce evidence that they have converted a minimum of US$5 at the official rate of exchange for each day's stay. Nonresidents other than Indian nationals are not allowed to bring in Nepalese or Indian bank notes. Other foreign bank notes may be brought in freely by residents and nonresidents, but residents and Indian nationals must declare any foreign bank notes they bring in.

Foreign investors who have obtained an investment guarantee are eligible for outward remittances in respect of the following items: all or part of the sales proceeds of investment, dividends, interest or principal repayment, amounts arising from the transfer of technology, and compensations on acquired assets. In cases of proceeds of investment sales and dividends, remittances may be subject to installments fixed by the Government. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form in Nepal. Imports of gold require a license and are subject to an import duty of NRs 6.65 a troy ounce; such imports are not normally allowed. Exports of gold may be made only by the monetary authorities and require prior approval by the Ministry of Finance. ©International Monetary Fund.

The Netherlands participates w i th Belgium, Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Luxembourg in the exchange rate and intervention mechanism of the European Monetary Sys- tem (EMS). In accordance w i th this agreement, the Netherlands maintains the spot exchange rates between the Netherlands guilder and the currencies of the other participants within margins of 2.25 percent (in the case of the Italian lira, 6 percent) above or below the cross rates based on the central rates expressed in European Currency Units (ECUs). The agreement implies that the Netherlands Bank (the central bank) stands ready to buy or sell the currencies of the other participating states in unlimited amounts at specified intervention rates. On December 31, 1984 these rates were as follows: Specified Intervention Rates Per: Netherlands Guilders Upper limit Lower limit 100 Belgian or Luxembourg francs 100 Danish kroner 100 deutsche mark 100 French francs 1 Irish pound 10,000 Italian lire 5.7535 31.7325 115.235 37.58 3.5600 19.1100 5.5005 30.3375 110.1675 35.925 3.4030 16.9500 The participants in the EMS do not maintain exchange rates for other currencies within fixed limits. However, in order to ensure a proper functioning of the system, they intervene in concert to smooth out fluctuations in exchange rates, the intervention currencies being each other's and the U .S. dollar. The authorized banks quote buying and selling rates for 15 foreign currencies.1 On December 31, 1984 the authorized banks' buy ing and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were f. 3.54825 and f. 3.55075, respec- t ive ly, per US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Authorized banks are freely permitted to buy and sell convertible and inconvertible currencies, both spot and forward, against convertible currencies, including de- posits in nonresident guilder accounts and inconvertible currencies; they are free to deal with residents and nonresidents, whether banks or nonbanks. Forward exchange contracts are not limited as to delivery period, nor is an underlying transaction required. Residents are free to conclude spot transactions w i th other residents, 'A u s t r i an sch i l l ings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Irish pounds, Japanese yen, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and U .S. dollars. 356 including authorized banks, and they may conclude forward transactions w i th authorized banks for any period. The intermediation of authorized banks is not obligatory in those forward currency transactions in which the guilder is not involved. Nonbank residents are free to hold foreign currency accounts in the Netherlands. The Kingdom of the Netherlands formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2 , 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from February 15, 1961. Exchange Control Territory Transactions with the Netherlands Antilles are subject to the same exchange controls as transactions w i th other countries. With regard to any third countries with which payments agreements might be in force, the Netherlands and the Netherlands Antilles w i l l, if so stipulated, constitute the Netherlands Monetary Area. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Netherlands Bank on behalf of the Ministers of Foreign Affa irs, Finance, Economic Affa irs, and Agriculture. Import and export licensing, including transit trade,2 are handled by the Central Import-Export Agency (CDIU) and the delegated offices, under directives from the Directorate- General for Foreign Economic Relations. For their payments to and receipts from nonresidents in the Netherlands, residents are generally required to use the intermediation of banks or other domestic institutions or persons authorized by the Netherlands Bank to handle these exchange transactions within the scope of the regulations based on the External Financial Relations Act 1980 (see section on Capital, below). To facilitate the compilation of the balance of payments, residents are required to indicate on reporting forms, for all payments to and receipts from nonresidents exceeding f. 5,000, the nature of the underlying transaction as well as the currency and amount paid or received. Separate regula- tions govern the reporting of settlements where no transfer of money is involved. Residents are free to open and maintain bank accounts abroad and to maintain current accounts abroad for the purpose of settlements. The Netherlands Bank must be notified of such accounts, and entries in them are to be reported to the Bank in accordance w i th the related regulations. Prescription of Currency In effecting payments to nonresidents or collecting receipts from them, residents may make use of guilders or any foreign currency. Payments in any foreign 2 The on ly transit trade transactions still subject to specific license are purchases and sales of strategic goods. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution currency between residents may be made freely. There are no bilateral payments agreements in force. Nonresi- dents are free to open and maintain nonresident accounts with authorized banks in the Netherlands in guilders or any foreign currency, and to effect payments to, or collect receipts from, residents. All current payments or receipts are freely permitted, as well as transfers of balances to and from other nonresident accounts. Some capital payments, however, are subject to license from the Netherlands Bank (see section on Capital, below). Imports and Import Payments Import licenses are required for imports originating in Hong Kong, Japan, and state-trading countries,3 as well as for the importation of goods of unknown origin. In addition, import licenses are required for a limited number of products, mainly those of the agricultural, steel, and textile sectors. Except for imports of textiles originating in the Far East and in state-trading countries (see footnote 3), most imports that require an import license are free from quantitative restriction. Most imports from Eastern European countries are formally liberalized. Imports from non-EC countries of most products covered by the Common Agricultural Policy of the EC are subject to import levies that have replaced all previous barriers to imports; common EC regulations are also applied to imports from non-EC countries of most other agricultural and livestock products. Payments for imports may be made freely, provided that the method of payment conforms to the relative exchange control regulations. Payments for Invisibles Payments abroad for invisibles are permitted freely. Residents may take out any amount in foreign and domestic bank notes and coin or documents of value for travel purposes; these may be used for traveling expenses abroad, as well as for purchases for which payment in cash is customary in the trade concerned. Payments for interest, dividends, and contractual amortization due to nonresidents are permitted freely. Nonresidents may export all unutilized documents of value for travel purposes, as well as foreign and Netherlands bank notes and coin which they have imported or have obtained in the Netherlands by drawing on their accounts or by exchanging other currencies. Exports and Export Proceeds Export licenses are required for only a few com- modities, mostly of a strategic character, and for some agricultural products, iron and steel scrap and related products, and certain nonferrous metals. Residents may freely grant credit in respect of exports of commodities. The surrender of export proceeds is not obligatory. 3 State-trading countries are defined for this purpose as consisting of A lban ia, Bulgaria, the People's Republic of Ch ina, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Repub l ic, Hunga ry, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, the U . S . S .R ., and Viet Nam. NETHERLANDS Proceeds from Invisibles There are no requirements attached to receipts by residents from current invisibles. Nonresidents may bring into the Netherlands for travel purposes any amount of foreign bank notes and documents of value; these may be used for traveling expenses in the Nether- lands, as well as for purchases for which payment in cash is customary in the trade concerned. Capital Exchange control in the Netherlands is based on the External Financial Relations Act 1980. This Act limits potential restriction to capital transactions, except when current payments and capital transactions are inter- woven, as in payment intervals relating to trade transactions. Most external capital transactions are unrestricted. The main capital transactions of nonbank residents still subject to case-by-case review are long-term lending ( i .e ., with a maturity of at least two years) to nonresi- dents exceeding f. 10 million a year to the same nonresident. Direct investment in the form of capital participations (inward and outward) is free of license. Short-term lending (for less than two years) to nonresidents (whether affiliated companies or others) is free of license, as is longer-term lending, up to f. 10 mil- lion a calendar year to the same nonresident; larger amounts are normally permitted on application. Public issues on the domestic capital market on behalf of nonresidents are subject to the issues calendar, and if necessary limited by the Netherlands Bank, in accor- dance with the market's capacity to absorb issues. In the private placement sector of the capital market (the market for onderhandse leningen), where mainly ins t i tu- tional investors act as lenders, a queue system for nonresident borrowers is used as well, to ensure orderly market conditions. Transactions between residents and nonresidents in all stocks and bonds listed on the Amsterdam Stock Ex- change take place at official market exchange rates and are unrestricted. Residents may freely purchase off ic ia l ly listed securities abroad. Placement with residents of unlisted foreign debentures denominated in guilders (such as foreign Euroguilder notes) is subject to license, bu t, u sua l ly, the license is automatically granted as part of the authorization for credit institutions to manage such a placement. Transactions in unlisted stocks are free of license. Nonresidents may have their securities, domes- tic or foreign, exported to them; securities held in the Netherlands are not subject to deposit. Nonresidents may freely purchase real estate in the Netherlands for personal use or investment, and resi- dents may freely purchase real estate abroad. Extension of payment and mortgage borrowing from nonresidents w i th in the framework of such transactions is free of license. G if ts and donations to nonresidents are free. Emi- grants may export any amount in foreign and domestic 357 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NETHERLANDS currency. They acquire nonresident status upon leaving the Netherlands and may upon departure have remitted to them their total assets in the Netherlands. Nonresidents inheriting from estates in the Netherlands may have the proceeds transferred to them freely. There are no restrictions on commercial banks' spot external positions. They are, however, required to maintain a balanced total position in each foreign currency ( i .e ., spot plus forward position). In this context, the banks are required to report their spot position, as well as their forward position, w i th residents and nonresidents, respectively, in each foreign currency at the end of each month; for deutsche mark, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, and U .S. dollars, the same data must also be reported at midmonth. Moreover, copies of all forward exchange contracts w i th nonresidents are forwarded to the Netherlands Bank. Authorized banks may freely extend foreign currency loans to nonresidents as well as short-term guilder loans ( i .e ., for less than two years); for longer-term guilder loans a license is required if they exceed f. 10 million a calendar year to the same nonresident (bank or nonbank). The banks' freedom to accept deposits from nonresidents and to borrow abroad is unrestricted. All capital transfers by nonbank residents, whether free or permitted under license, must be notified to the Balance of Payments Department of the Netherlands Bank. This includes suppliers' credits granted or re- ceived for periods in excess of one year. Totals of security transactions must be reported periodically by securities brokers and authorized banks or, if transac- tions take place through a foreign bank account, by the resident parties concerned. Gold The Netherlands Bank engages in gold transactions only with monetary authorities and international finan- cial ins t i tu t ions. Neither the Bank nor any government agency imports or markets gold for industrial use. Authorized banks and nonbank residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold (fine gold, gold coin, and gold alloys) in the Netherlands or abroad. Imports and exports of gold do not require exchange licenses or import and export licenses. There is a free gold market in Amsterdam. Except for transactions of the Netherlands Bank, transfers of gold in bars and other elementary forms are subject to a value-added tax of 5 percent, as are domestic sales of gold coin. All other gold transac- tions are taxed at 19 percent. Commercial imports of gold jewelry and of articles containing minor quantities of gold, such as watches, require import licenses only when originating in Hong Kong, Japan, or state-trading countries.

The official buying rates for the U .S. dollar on December 31, 1984 were NA f. 1.77 per US$1 for bank notes and NA f. 1.79 per US$1 for drafts, checks, and transfers. The official selling rate was NA f. 1.81 per US$1. The Bank of Netherlands Antilles (the central bank) deals with commercial banks at NA f. 1.80 per US$1; it does not normally deal with the public. Official buying and selling rates for certain other currencies2 are set daily on the basis of rates for the U .S. dollar abroad. There is an exchange tax3 of 1.30 percent on sales of foreign exchange.4 Administration of Control Exchange licenses, where required, are issued by the central bank. Import licenses, where required, are issued by the Department of Economic Affairs. The commer- cial banks are permitted by the central bank to provide foreign exchange for almost all current transactions without prior approval. Prescription of Currency Payments may be made in any currency except Netherlands Antillean guilders. Receipts may be ac- cepted in any convertible currency except Netherlands Antillean guilders. All payments made by residents to nonresidents, as well as all receipts through the autho- rized banks, must be reported to the central bank. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents may freely open nonresident accounts in any foreign currency. Nonresidents are permitted to hold nonresident accounts in Netherlands Antillean guilders only if the authorized bank concerned considers that they have certain interests in the Netherlands Antilles which render such an account desirable; balances in such accounts may not exceed NA f. 10,000 without central bank approval. 1 The Netherlands Antilles is a nonmetropolitan territory in respect of which the Kingdom of the Netherlands has accepted the Fund's Articles of Agreement. 2Canadian dollars, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Suriname guilders, and Swiss francs. 3 Purchases of foreign exchange by resident companies w i th nonresi- dent status for exchange control purposes are exempt from the exchange tax. 4 All currencies other than the Netherlands Antillean guilder are considered foreign currencies. Imports and Import Payments Payments for permitted imports may be made freely. The importation of certain products for which there are locally produced substitutes is subject to quotas. Certain commodities are subject to import surcharges in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curasao.

Investment by residents in real estate situated abroad is normally permitted. Investment in officially listed foreign securities is generally permitted, provided the securities are registered abroad in the name of an authorized bank. Institutional investors are subject to special supervision with respect to foreign investments. Authorized banks' overall position w i th relation to nonresidents is subject to limits set by the central bank, and must, in any event, be positive. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in the Netherlands Antilles. Authorized banks may freely negotiate gold coin among themselves and with other residents. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the central bank; such licenses are not normally granted. Changes During 1984 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 359 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NEW ZEALAND (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement1 The currency of New Zealand is the New Zealand Dollar. Exchange rates are computed on the basis of the fixed relationship between the New Zealand dollar and a basket of currencies representing New Zealand's main trading partners. The weights of the currencies in the basket are established in accordance w i th their propor- tionate share of New Zealand's total current overseas receipts and payments; the weights are adjusted quar- terly. The exchange rate of the New Zealand dollar in terms of the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, varies during each trading day on the basis of the average weighted variations in quotations for the U .S. dollar in relation to the other currencies included in the basket. On December 31, 1984, the closing buy ing and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were US$0.4723 and US$0.4823, respectively, per $NZ 1. The trading banks and autho- rized foreign exchange dealers are free to adjust ex- change rate quotations in response to market conditions throughout each business day. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. On August 5, 1982, New Zealand formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund Agreement. The trading banks and authorized dealers are per- mitted to conclude with their customers forward ex- change contracts to buy or sell foreign currencies in exchange for New Zealand dollars, irrespective of the purpose for which the funds are required or the source from which they are obtained, provided that any outward remittance made in the form of a forward contract also complies with exchange control regulations. These for- ward contracts may be either for a fixed term or for optional delivery dates. The Reserve Bank does not maintain margins in respect of forward exchange transactions. Authorized foreign exchange dealers are free to set their own rates of forward transactions with their customers. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. The Reserve Bank has given discretion- ary authority to the trading banks and other authorized foreign exchange dealers to approve applications for certain remittances of funds overseas. The Overseas Investment Commission administers the regulations gov- erning foreign direct investment in New Zealand. Export 1 In a modification of their exchange arrangement, the New Zealand authorities on March 4, 1985, introduced a flexible exchange rate system under which the Reserve Bank ceased to quote official buy ing and selling rates for the New Zealand dollar against foreign currencies, but retained the option of entering the market to smooth new exchange rate adjustments in periods of disturbed conditions. 360 and import licensing is the responsibility of the Customs Department and the Department of Trade and Indu s t ry, respectively. Prescription of Currency Payments to and from residents of countries other than New Zealand may be made or received in any foreign currency.2 Payment to and from New Zealand currency accounts held w i th banks in New Zealand by banks not domiciled in New Zealand is also an acceptable form of payment. Nonresident Accounts Overseas banks' accounts in New Zealand may be used for the settlement of transactions with other countries, but they may only be funded from overseas or by amounts that would otherwise be remittable from New Zealand. Imports and Import Payments3 Imports are controlled through an Import Licensing Schedule. The import categories included in the schedule are as follows. The "Exempt" category covers v ir tua l ly all primary products (other than wheat), most raw materials and components (e .g ., base chemicals and fertilizers), machinery not produced in New Zealand, and some consumer goods. Goods in this category are exempt from licensing, as are a small range of specified goods of Australian origin as defined under the terms of the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations and Trade (ANZCERT) Agreement that came into force on January 1, 1983; there are a limited number of general exemptions. With the exception of a few specified products, imports from the Pacific Islands4 under the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Coopera- tion Agreement (SPARTECA) are free of licensing and du ty requirements. On a value basis, about 75 percent of all private imports are exempt from licensing. The "Basic" category comprises items for wh ich licenses are granted by reference to either the amount of licenses issued or the actual value of imports in a previous licensing period. Goods covered by this category are generally consumer goods and a range of materials for use in manufacture. Licenses for imports under this category have been issued in general where there is local manufacture to provide some opportunity for import 2 Foreign currencies are defined as all currencies other than New Zealand currency. 3 Under the budget announcement of November 8, 1984, import license allocations for goods not covered by the indus t ry development plans were, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, to be increased each year by 5 percent of the domestic market, beg inn ing in 1985. 4The is lands under this arrangement are those cons t i tu t ing the South Pacific Forum (in addition to Aus t ra l ia and New Zealand), Cook Islands, Fiji, K ir iba t i, Nau ru, N iu e, Papua New Gu inea, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuv a lu, V anu a tu, and Western Samoa. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution competition. The "Special" category covers a wide range of commodities, including most manufactures, for exam- ple, machinery and appliances, ships, and motor vehi- cles. Special category licenses are granted on an indi- vidual basis and on such criteria as availability of domestic alternatives and price and are not automatically reissued in future licensing periods. The overall administration of the system has been eased over the recent past, with greater availability of licenses for inputs to export-oriented industry, to encour- age rationalization of production and greater cost con- tainment within industry generally. An increasing number of import licenses are being issued under a tender system covering a wide range of goods. Tendering is intended to provide a means of moving away from the historical basis of license alloca- tion, and has been adopted for allocating additional licenses under a number of industry development plans5 and some licenses under the ANZCERT Agreement. Tendering is also applied to allocate additional global licenses under the 1984 budget. Most licenses issued may be used to import from any source; the main exceptions to this are licenses under special schemes and agreements such as the developing countries' handicraft scheme, the special trade license scheme, and the ANZCERT Agreement. A degree of flexibility in the application of the Import Licensing Schedule is achieved through the use of Group Schemes (for Industry and Interchangeability Groups) that enable importers to transfer individual entitlements to a composite license instead of holding licenses for separate items, and to import, up to the total amount, any item or combination of items in the group. "No-remittance licenses" for goods controlled under the Import Licensing Schedule may be issued in special circumstances, for example, for advertising material supplied free of charge, gifts, passengers' baggage, replacement of faulty or damaged goods, trade samples supplied free of charge, and temporary imports. Payments for Invisibles The trading banks and other authorized foreign ex- change dealers are permitted to sell foreign exchange for invisible payments, subject in appropriate cases to the submission of written declarations of the purpose of the transfer. The remittance abroad of dividends, interest, profits, and other forms of contractual obligation to nonresidents may be freely made, subject to formal declaration. An international departure tax of $NZ 25 a person aged 12 and over ($NZ 5 for children over 2 but under 12) is payable on all tickets obtained in New Zealand for departure from New Zealand, except for certain promotional, cultural, or educational travel. This tax is administered by the Customs Department. 5 The industry development plan announced for the automobile industry on December 12, 1984, included a phased reduction of import tariffs on completely knocked-down car packs and bu i l t -up trucks over a period of 4-5 years starting from January 1, 1985, and for gradual increases in import access for bu i l t-up vehicles, up to 17.5 percent of domestic production, by 1988. NEW ZEALAND Exports and Export Proceeds There is no requirement for obligatory return of export earnings ( inc lud ing foreign currency earned for perform- ing services in New Zealand for foreign nationals) through the banking system. General export licenses, valid for five years, are issued to regular exporters. Particular export licenses, as required, are issued to new exporters or to those who do not export on a regular basis. Unless prior consent is obtained, payments for exports must be received w i th in six months from the date of shipment. Certain items classified as strategic goods may be exported only when specific requirements have been met and an export permit has been issued. Encouragement is extended by the Government aimed at raising the level of exports from New Zealand, particularly nontraditional exports. Three new export incentive schemes were introduced on April 1, 1980 to replace existing incentives: (1) The Export Performance Taxation Incentive (EPTI),6 an incentive related to the sale of goods and services (including tourism) and based on a f irm's net foreign exchange earnings; (2) the Export Market Development Taxation Incentive (EMDTI), de- signed to encourage the development of export markets; and (3) the Export Programme Suspensory Loan Scheme, an alternative to the EMDTI and designed to encourage firms to undertake more thorough and coor- dinated marketing programs than is the case under the EMDTI. A bilateral trade agreement with Australia provides for the phased elimination between 1985 and 1987 of all performance-based export incentive schemes. To facilitate export competitiveness, import licenses can be issued to manufacturing exporters for materials and components where it is established that equivalent goods available from domestic sources have price or other characteristics that jeopardize export performance. Bonus import licenses are available to manufacturers who have exported manufactured goods in which licensed imported raw materials and components have been used. Proceeds from Invisibles When remuneration for services provided or to be provided in New Zealand for overseas residents by New Zealand residents (including corporate bodies ordinarily resident in New Zealand) is paid in the form of foreign assets,7 the foreign currency proceeds must be sold to 6 In conjunction w i th the import liberalization measures announced on August 15, 1984, the New Zealand authorities decided that (a) the EPTI would be phased out between April 1, 1985 and Apr il 1, 1987, (b) a number of export suspensory loan schemes would be terminated on March 31, 1985, and (c) that the ongoing review of other forms of export assistance would be continued w i th a view to comp le t ing it as soon as possible. 7 The kinds of remuneration that are involved are (1) the payment or provision of any money; (2) the crediting of any sum in any account at any bank or w i th any person; (3) the acquisition or prov is ion of any securities, or any real or personal property, or of any r ight thereto or interest therein (whether actual or con t ingen t); and (4) any benef i t, whether by way of doing work or the performance of services, or otherwise, under any contract agreement, scheme, or transaction of any kind (whether or not it is enforceable or intended to be enforceable by legal proceedings). 361 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NEW ZEALAND the New Zealand banking system; interest and dividends earned overseas from portfolio investment are excluded from this surrender requirement. If the remuneration is in a form other than a foreign currency or a balance with an overseas bank, it must be converted into foreign cur- rency and then surrendered. The disposal overseas by New Zealand residents of foreign income from other invisibles such as interest and dividends is permitted, and the foreign currency pro- ceeds may be sold to a New Zealand bank. Travelers may bring into the country unlimited amounts of foreign and domestic bank notes and coin. Capital With the exception of capital issues outside New Zealand and overseas borrowings, consents are not required in respect of capital receipts. Overseas borrow- ing by corporate entities requires the approval of the . Overseas Investment Commission. To be eligible for repatriation capital must have been transferred to New Zealand through normal banking channels or in some other way approved by the authorities, for example, as imports of plant or machinery. Capital so transferred, including capital gains and capitalized profits, may be repatriated after the formal approval of the Reserve Bank has been obtained. In the case of overseas borrowing, repayments are not normally permitted until the expiry of the term for which the funds were originally borrowed. All overseas entities seeking to establish themselves in New Zealand must obtain the approval of the Overseas Investment Commission. Nonresident persons or compa- nies wishing to make a direct investment in a New Zealand company through the purchase or exchange of shares are required to obtain the consent of the Overseas Investment Commission in respect of any proposed offer for such shares whenever the investment would confer on the offerer the beneficial entitlement to 25 percent or more of any class of shares, or enable the offerer to exercise 25 percent or more of the voting power at any general meeting. Emigrants may transfer abroad their entire assets upon their departure from New Zealand. Applications for the remittance abroad of legacies from the estate of a New Zealand resident are normally approved in fu l l. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coin in New Zealand without restriction. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than gold coin and jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler require licenses issued by the Customs Department; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. Commercial imports of gold jewelry are licensed restrictively. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement June 18. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand re- entered the forward foreign exchange market, initially 362 quoting a premium of 12 percent, raised later in the day to 20 percent, per annum for forward contracts. In addition, with a view to easing pressures on the forward exchange market, major government-owned corpora- tions and nonresidents were made ineligible for forward cover. July 4. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand ceased to quote premiums for 15-day forward contracts. July 6. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand raised the premium for forward sales of the intervention currency (the U .S. dollar) to 25 percent per annum. July 15. All foreign exchange dealings were temporar- ily suspended. July 18. The suspension of foreign exchange dealings was lifted, and the New Zealand dollar was devalued by 20 percent in terms of its trade-weighted basket of foreign currencies. In addition, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand withdrew from the forward foreign ex- change market and the restrictions placed on access to this market by major government-owned corporations and nonresidents were lifted. Imports and Import Payments July 1. Import license allocations specified on a value basis were increased by 5 percent, and those specified on a volume basis remained unchanged. August 15. It was announced that all import license allocations based on value would be increased by 25 per- cent, thereby maintaining import access to the pre- devaluation volume level. In addition, it was decided that import access of goods not covered by industry development plans would be raised to a minimum level of 10 percent of the estimated domestic market (produc- tion less exports) through issuance of additional import license allocations by tender, followed by annual in- creases in tendered allocations of 2.5 to 5 percent of the domestic market. November 8. It was announced that import license allocations for goods not covered by industry devel- opment plans would be increased each year by 5 percent of the domestic market, beginning in 1985, unless exceptional circumstances prevailed. December 12. The industry development plan for the motor industry was released, providing, inter alia, for the phased reduction of import tariffs on completely knocked-down car packs and built-up trucks over a period of four to five years starting from January 1, 1985, and for gradual increases in import access for built-up vehicles, up to 17.5 percent of domestic production by 1988. Payments for Invisibles June 6. It was announced that limits on sales of foreign exchange by banks without prior reference to the Reserve Bank would be increased from $NZ 1,000 a person a month or part thereof (within a maximum of $NZ 4,000 a person in any 12-month period) to ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NEW ZEALAND $NZ 3,000 a person a month, with a max imum limit of $NZ 10,000 a person in any 12-month period. Exports and Export Proceeds August 15. As an accompanying measure to import liberalization, it was announced that the Export Perfor- mance Taxation Incentive (the main export support scheme) would be phased out between April 1, 1985 and April 1, 1987; in addition, several export suspensory loan schemes would be terminated on March 31, 1985, and the ongoing review of other forms of export assistance would be continued with a view to completing it as soon as possible. September 14. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand withdrew certain export facilities designed to assist trading banks in meeting the postshipment requirements of exporters. November 8. The Export Market Development scheme was extended by one year to March 31, 1986. Capital November 21. All restrictions on the access of foreign- owned companies operating in New Zealand to the domestic capital market were removed, and f inanc ial institutions other than those licensed to deal in foreign exchange were given the freedom to borrow abroad to finance their day-to-day operations. (The licensed foreign exchange dealers would continue to be subject to currency exposure limits.) 363 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NICARAGUA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement1 The currency of Nicaragua is the Nicaraguan Cor- doba. The official exchange market consists of three different exchange rates: (a) one of C$10 per US$1 (the "official rate") for a part of export proceeds and for most import payments, (b) a special rate of C$15 per US$1 for imports of certain capital goods, and (c) the so-called parallel market exchange rate of C$28 per US$1 for the remainder of export proceeds, imports of private motor vehicles, and most invisible transactions. In addition, a number of implicit exchange rates arise from various m ix ing arrangements of the two basic rates for the surrender of export proceeds. On December 31, 1984, the buy ing and selling rates for the two major exchange rates in the official market (i.e., those mentioned under (a) and (b) above) were C$10.00 and C$10.10 per US$1, and C$28.00 and C$28.50 per US$1, respectively. There is another informal and illegal market in which the value of the cordoba fluctuates widely (around C$300 per US$1 in December 1984). Only the Central Bank and the authorized commercial banks are authorized to buy and sell foreign exchange; transactions outside the banking system are prohibited, with the exception of hotels which may purchase foreign exchange at the parallel rate from their guests but have to surrender these receipts to the banking system. Foreign-currency-de- nominated accounts can be opened at the banking system. Nicaragua accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2 , 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, on Ju ly 30, 1964. Administration of Control The exchange control system is administered by the Central Bank. The Central Bank has the sole authority to buy and sell foreign exchange, but has authorized commercial banks to make foreign exchange transac- tions. However, the Central Bank approves all foreign exchange transactions. All requests for foreign exchange are subject to a comprehensive system of administrative rationing. Requests relating to low-priority imports and invisible payments are routinely rejected. The Central Bank is also responsible for classifying imports and for 1 On February 8, 1985, in a move invo lv ing an effective depreciation of the cordoba, the Nicaraguan authorities introduced a new exchange arrangement based on the following features: (i) a rate of C$10 = US$1 for payments of interest and capital on external loans disbursed by this date; (ii) a rate of C$20 = US$1 for imports of raw materials, spare parts, and essential consumer goods; (iii) a rate of C$28 = US$1 for receipts from exports, fre igh t, insurance, port services, investment income, and specified payments ( inc lud ing those for imports of petroleum products and of certain nonessential goods); ( iv) a rate of C$40 = US$1 for imports of many capital goods; (v) a rate of C$50 = US$1 for exports of printed materials, international commun ica t ion services, foreign grants, and specified payments ( inc lud ing official travel and medical expenses); and (v i) a legal free market rate that was to be established for specified receipts and payments, inc lud ing receipts from tourism, private remittances, and paymen ts for imports of goods not otherwise specified. 364 issuing export authorizations. Exchange licensing is fu l ly integrated w i th import licensing. There are four stages for the approval of requests for purchase of foreign exchange from the bank ing system for imports: the first stage involves the screening by the pertinent sectoral ministry, wh ich determines the consistency of a foreign exchange request w i th the development priorities; this process takes one to seven days. The second stage, which usua l ly takes a week, pertains to the screening by the Technical Commission on Exports and Imports (CTIE), which ensures that requests approved by each sectoral m in is try are w i th in their exchange budget allocation. The third stage refers to the screening by the Ministerial Commission on Foreign Exchange, composed of the President of the Central Bank and the Ministers of Finance, External Trade, and External Cooperation; this commission, wh ich meets once every one or two weeks, seeks to assure consistency between the global demand and supply of foreign exchange. The last stage relates to the final approval by the Central Bank Commission on Foreign Exchange Allocation (CAD), which performs a f inal check on the require- ments of the first three stages and on the actual availability of foreign exchange and has a final veto on requests for foreign exchange. A representative of the Governing Jun ta (or the President of the Republic) may participate in meetings of the CAD. Importers using their own foreign currency accounts are not required to go through the four-stage process of approval, but they are required to show proof of sources of funds and are subject to an annual l im it of US$10,000 unless higher amounts are specifically authorized by the Central Bank. Prescription of Currency There is no prescription of currency, but the customs authorities have the power to prohibit an export if the currency stipulated for payment is not readily convertible into U .S. dollars in international markets. Payments to Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras with respect to trade and invisibles may be settled in Nicara- guan cordobas through the Central American Clearing House; however, for compensation through the Central American Clearing House, there are monthly limits on bank notes per exporter: (a) 100,000 Salvadoran colones for El Salvador, (b) 200,000 Guatemalan quetzales for Guatemala, and (c) 50,000 Honduran lempiras for Honduras. Imports and Import Payments All importers are required to be registered w i th the Ministry of External Trade; th is requirement can be waived for ind iv idua ls who import only occasionally for their own needs and who make import settlements w i th foreign exchange obtained in the official market. There ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution are several categories of registered importers: (1) The Empresa Nicaraguense de Insumos Agropecuarios, which has a virtual monopoly on imports of agricultural inputs; (2) the Empresa Nicaraguense de Importaciones, which imports capital goods for the People's Property Area (APP) enterprises (both being state enterprises under the supervision of the Ministry of External Trade); and (3) commercial and industrial importers, including border traders. Border traders are given a general license to import or export up to the equivalent of US$1,500 a month (at the parallel rate). In principle, general import licenses are valid until the end of the calendar year in which they are issued, but the Central Bank may limit the validity of licenses in certain cases to only 60 days. For each individual import, including imports settled with foreign exchange obtained from the banking system at the parallel rate, but excluding imports financed with own foreign-currency deposit accounts, a specific permit is required. Importers must initiate their application with the pertinent sectoral ministry. Applications with the higher priorities are then submitted to the Technical Commission for Imports and Exports for further screening. Screened applications are submitted to the Ministerial Commission on Foreign Exchange for ap- proval and subsequently to the Central Bank Commis- sion for Foreign Exchange Allocation for a final deci- sion. Certain import items classified as essential are eligible for foreign exchange at the official rate; these include basic food products, medicines and medical equipment, petroleum and its derivatives, agricultural machinery, spare parts and tools, and public transportation equip- ment; many of these essential imports are subject to a special import duty of C$2 per US$1 of import. Most other authorized import items classified as nonessential are also eligible for foreign exchange at the official rate, but are subject to a higher special import duty of C$3 per US$1 of import. For certain nonessential import items, the special import duty of C$3 per US$ 1 is a replacement for the previous exchange tax on such imports. Certain capital goods can be imported only at a special exchange rate of C$15.00 per US$1. Private motor vehicles may be imported only at the parallel rate of C$28.00 per US$1, but are not subject to the special import duty of C$3 or C$2 per US$1. Imports can also be financed with the use of own foreign-currency accounts up to a limit of US$10,000 per year, unless higher amounts are specific- ally authorized by the Central Bank. Payments for imports from the Central American region must be effected by bank check or certified check in cordobas, authorized for conversion through the Central American Clearing House. Payments for imports from outside the Central American region must be settled through the banking system.2 Payments are usually 2However, by virtue of Decree No. 1-L (effective March 1, 1963) the exchange proceeds from bananas, coconuts, copra, and coconut by- products exported through the ports of the region of El Cabo and the Department of Zelaya may be used by the exporters to pay for imports consumed in these areas. NICARAGUA made w i th sight drafts, but letters of credit are generally used for imports from Japan. Central Bank approval is required to open letters of credit; the banks are not permitted to sell foreign exchange before the arrival of the import documents. Imports are not released from customs unless evidence is submitted that either payment or acceptance of payment has been made through a bank. In the latter case, the Central Bank must also approve the credit terms, but this requirement does not apply to duty- free imports from member countries of the Central American Common Market. The Central Bank may authorize deferred payments or payment with funds derived from properly authenticated credits obtained abroad, usually for imports of raw materials and capital goods intended for priority development. Under the provisions of the Central American Agree- ment on Fiscal Incentives, Nicaragua grants duty exoner- ations on imports of raw materials and capital goods to approved industrial firms. Most imports originating from outside the Central American Common Market are subject to an import surcharge of 30 percent of the applicable import du ty. In addition to custom duties, many nonessential imports are subject to a special import duty of C$3 per US$1 and many essential imports to a special import duty of C$2 per US$1. Certain imports are also subject to a selective consumption tax, irrespec- tive of origin. In addition, most commodities, whether imported or domestically produced, are subject to a 10 percent general sales tax. Payments for Invisibles All sales of foreign exchange by the banking system for payments of invisibles must be authorized by the Central Bank. Foreign exchange for approved applica- tions for purposes of tourism, study, and medical treatment abroad, as well as for family remittances and other transactions as decided by the Central Bank, can be purchased from the commercial banks at the parallel market rate, or can be financed from the use of own foreign-currency deposit accounts. Holders of foreign- currency-denominated accounts w i th the domestic banks may use those accounts up to US$10,000 a year for payments of invisibles, unless higher amounts are specifically authorized by the Central Bank. Resident travelers are not allowed to take out more than US$500 in foreign bank notes at any given time, and may not take in or out of the country more than C$5,000 a month in domestic bank notes. With a very few exceptions, most payments for invisibles must be settled at the parallel rate. Airlines operating or represented in Nicaragua must accept payment for tickets in cordobas at the parallel exchange rate; the Central Bank will authorize the sale of foreign exchange at the parallel rate to these companies equiva- lent to the U .S. dollar amount of the net income from authorized activities. There are arrears on interest obligations of the public sector. 365 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NICARAGUA Exports and Export Proceeds Five public enterprises under the Ministry of External Trade have a monopoly on the exports of coffee, cotton, meat, sugar, and certain nontraditional exports; export of these items requires a general authorization from the Central Bank. Other exports require specific authoriza- tion from the Central Bank, which is issued after verifying that the export prices are consistent with those prevailing in international markets. W i th a few exceptions, foreign exchange proceeds from exports must be surrendered to an authorized bank within 30 to 60 days of shipment. Licensed border traders must surrender any excess of export receipts over import payments at the end of each month at the parallel exchange rate to the banking system. Failure to surrender foreign exchange from export proceeds will result in revocation of the export license. Proceeds from exports must be surrendered to an authorized bank at the applicable implicit exchange rate resulting from the particular mixing of the two basic rates (the official and parallel rates). All proceeds from sugar, banana, and meat exports can be surrendered at the parallel rate. Based on the specified ratios, the average exchange rates in effect for the respective commodities on December 31, 1984 were as follows: (1) coffee: C$14.15 per US$1 (76.95 percent at the official rate and 23.05 percent at the parallel rate); (2) cotton: C$18.42 per US$1 (53.22 percent at the official rate and 46.78 percent at the parallel rate); (3) sesame: C$16.39 per US$1 (64.51 percent at the official rate and 35.49 percent at the parallel rate); (4) certain manufactured exports: C$17.20 per US$1 (60 percent at the official rate and 40 percent at the parallel rate); (5) other manufactured exports:-C$22.60 per US$1 (30 percent at the official rate and 70 percent at the parallel rate); and (6) other exports: C$15.40 per US$1 (70 percent at the official rate and 30 percent at the parallel rate). A few agricultural export products are subject to ad valorem taxes, which are applied progressively with the international prices for those exports. Proceeds from Invisibles All exchange receipts from invisibles must either be surrendered to, or deposited with, the banking system. Foreign exchange receipts from invisibles, including remittances, tourism, and embassies' foreign exchange budget for domestic expenditures, may be sold to the banking system at the parallel rate; however, arriving adult tourists are required to exchange forthwith US$60 at the official rate. Charges for hotel rooms, including international telephone calls, must be settled in U .S. dollars. Capital All capital transactions require authorization from the Central Bank. Foreign exchange receipts from loans and investments made under the Foreign Investment Law 366 must be surrendered to the Central Bank through its authorized agents at the official exchange rate. Foreign exchange is sold at the official rate for servicing external public debt. With few exceptions, Central Bank authori- zation is given for servicing private external debt. There are arrears on principal obligations on public external debt. Gold Natural and juridical persons may trade in Nicaragua in gold coins for numismatic purposes only. The Nicara- guan Mining Institute manages the country's production. The Central Bank is in charge of selling this gold at prices prevailing in international gold markets. The export cost is transferred to the Ministry of Finance in Nicaraguan cordobas. The Central Bank sells gold to domestic, industrial, and other users. Commemorative gold coins were issued in 1967, 1975, and 1980. Changes During 1984 Imports and Import Payments April 1. It was announced that exchange settlement for imports of private motor vehicles should henceforth be made at the parallel market exchange rate. In addition, certain capital goods should be imported only at a special exchange rate of C$15 per US$1. December 27. The exchange tax of C$10 per US$1 on certain nonessential imports was replaced by a special import duty of C$3 per US$1 of imports. A new special import duty of C$2 per US$1 was also imposed on many essential imports which previously were exempt from the exchange tax of C$10 per US$1. Exports and Export Proceeds February I. Authorization was granted for all pro- ceeds of sugar exports to be surrendered at the parallel market exchange rate. March 8. The following changes in export surrender regulations came into effect: (a) for cotton, 53.22 per- cent of export proceeds from the 1984/85 crop year should be surrendered at the official rate and the rest at the parallel market exchange rate, giving a mixed rate of C$18.42 per US$1; (b) for coffee, 76.95 percent of export proceeds from the 1984/85 crop year should be surrendered at the official rate and the rest at the parallel market exchange rate, giving a mixed rate of C$14.15 per US$1; (c) for sesame, 64.51 percent of export proceeds from the 1984/85 crop year should be surren- dered at the official rate and the rest at the parallel market exchange rate, giving a mixed rate of C$16.39 per US$1; and (d) for bananas, all proceeds could be surrendered at the parallel market exchange rate.

Further changes were made in export surren- der regulations as follows: (a) for meat, one half of export proceeds should be surrendered at the official rate and the other half at the parallel market exchange rate, giving a mixed rate of C$19.00 per US$1; (b) for manufactured exports exempt from exchange tax on imported inputs, 60 percent of proceeds should be ©International Monetary Fund.

July 1. A regulation came into effect under which all proceeds from meat exports should be surrendered at the parallel rate. NICARAGUA 367 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NIGER (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Niger is the CFA Franc,1 which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. The official buying and selling rates are CFAF 50 = F 1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market and the fixed rate between the French franc and the CFA franc. The BCEAO levies a commission of 0.10 per mill on transfers from countries outside the West African Mone- tary Union and one of 2.50 per mill on transfers to such countries.2 Transfers by the Treasury and the Postal Administration and transactions in bank notes and traveler's checks are exempted. Banks levy a commis- sion, part of which must be surrendered to the Treasury, on transfers to all countries outside the West African Monetary Union. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of measures relating to gold and the repatriation of export proceeds, Niger's exchange controls do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mali, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the External Finance Directorate in the Ministry of Finance. The BCEAO is authorized to collect, either directly or through the banks, financial institutions, the Postal Administration, and notaries public, any information necessary to compile balance of payments statistics. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through the BCEAO, the Postal Administra- tion, or authorized banks. Import and export licenses are issued by the Directorate of External Trade in the Ministry of Commerce and Transportation, subject to endorsement by the External Finance Directorate, except for licenses relating to gold, which are granted by the Ministry of Finance. Import certificates for liberalized commodities are made out by the importer himself and are approved by the External Finance Directorate. Prescription of Currency Since Niger is an Operations Account country, set- tlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and lrThe CFA franc is issued by the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de 1'Quest (BCEAO) and is the common currency in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo. 2Transfers between member countries of the Union are subject to a flat commission of CFAF 100 levied on settlements between agencies of the BCEAO. 368 the Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any Operations Account country. Current payments to or from The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mau- ritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are normally made through the West African Clearing House. Certain settlements with Nigeria are still effected through special accounts.3 Settlements with all other countries are usually effected through correspondent banks in France, in foreign currencies, or in French francs, through Foreign Accounts in Francs. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. Foreign Accounts in Francs may be credited with BCEAO bank notes mailed to the BCEAO agency in Niamey by an authorized bank's foreign correspondent. Otherwise, the crediting to nonresident accounts of BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, or bank notes issued by any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury is prohibited. Foreign Accounts in Francs may be debited, without prior authorization, with the value of BCEAO bank notes mailed by authorized intermediaries to their foreign correspondents. Imports and Import Payments All imports originating in South Africa are prohibited. Imports of soap, cement, and certain printed cotton fabrics are prohibited, irrespective of origin, unless a special authorization is issued by the Ministry of Com- merce and Transportation. The import from any source of rice, paddy, hulled rice, wheat flour, butane gas, several types of fabric, certain footwear, and certain plastic goods requires prior authorization, irrespective of whether an import license or import certificate is also required. A similar regime applies to imports of sugar, except from member countries of the Common African and Mauritian Organization, and to imports of matches, unless they originate in a member country of the West African Economic Community. Imports from France and the Operations Account countries of all goods other than those mentioned above (or those listed in Article 1 of Order No. 042/MC/DCE of October 18, 1982) may be made freely without a license or certificate. Imports from other countries require either a license or an import certificate. Imports of virtually all goods from Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and the six original member states of the EC, many goods from other OECD countries and their past or present dependent territories, and a smaller number of items from the United States and Canada are 3The bilateral payments agreement with Nigeria lapsed at the end of 1977.

Not for Redistribution liberalized and require only an import certificate. Im- ports of nonliberalized goods from non-EC countries outside the French Franc Area are made under global quotas in accordance with an annual program determined each year by the Ministry of Commerce and Transporta- tion. Licenses for certain cotton fabrics are conditional upon purchases of the corresponding domestic product. Goods not subject to quantitative restriction may be imported on an import certificate. The Societe Nationale de Commerce et de Production du Niger (COPRONIGER) has a monopoly over the import of specified commodities. These include salt, cigarettes, green tea, and certain textiles. All import transactions with foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank when valued at more than CFAF 25,000 c . i .f. at the border. Import licenses or import certificates entitle importers to purchase the necessary exchange, provided that the authorized bank is satisfied that the import transaction is genuine and in accordance with the import title. Import certificates require the visa of the External Finance Directorate if the goods have to be paid for before they are imported. Foreign exchange may not be purchased before the payment due date if the goods have already been imported, or until eight days prior to the shipment date if the goods are covered by documen- tary credit. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to the approval of the External Finance Directorate, which for certain transactions has delegated its powers to the authorized banks. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transac- tion has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also per- mitted freely when the basic transaction has been approved. Residents traveling as tourists to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may obtain an exchange allocation equivalent to CFAF 100,000 a person a trip (CFAF 50,000 for children under ten years), which may be taken up twice a year; any foreign exchange in excess of CFAF 5,000 remaining after return to Niger must be sold within eight days to an authorized bank. The transfer of savings from their salaries by foreigners working in Niger is subject to prior approval by the External Finance Directorate and is normally limited to 50 percent of net pay. Larger transfers are permitted, however, for bona fide reasons. Residents traveling to foreign countries may take out up to a maximum of CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, and bank notes of other Operations Account countries, in addition to their travel allocation. Residents traveling to other countries of the French Franc Area may take out any amount in BCEAO bank notes but, when traveling to a country of the French NIGER Franc Area outside the West African Monetary Un ion, must declare these if they exceed CFAF 150,000. Nonresident travelers may freely take out up to CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, and bank notes of other Operations Account countries, and foreign notes up to the amount declared upon entry,4 or, if no declaration was made, up to CFAF 25,000; they may also take out freely any amount of foreign currency traveler's checks, etc., issued abroad in their name. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. All exports of rice and paddy require the prior authorization of the Ministry of Commerce and Transportation. Exports of millet and sorghum are prohibited unless covered by a shipping document in the name of the Office des Produits Vivriers du Niger (OPVN). Gum arabic may be exported only by COPRONIGER. With the exception of peanuts, peanut oil, peanut cakes, sisal, cotton, cotton- seed, and certain other imported items, all of which require a license, all other exports to France (as defined above) and the Operations Account countries may be made freely. Exports of domestic products and imported commodities to other countries require a license and an exchange commitment. In principle, the due date of payment for exports to foreign countries must not be later than 180 days after arrival of the goods at their destination. Proceeds from exports, regardless of the buying country, must be collected and surrendered through an authorized intermediary bank within one month of the due date. All exports, regardless of destination, must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value exceeds CFAF 500,000. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Ac- count countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services, and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets, must be collected and surrendered within two months of the due date or the date of receipt. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BCEAO, the Bank of France, or a bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin). Residents must surrender within eight days of entry any foreign currency in excess of CFAF 5,000. Capital Capital movements between Niger and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require exchange control approval 4This amount is reduced, when appropriate, by the amount sold for CFA francs and increased by the amount of foreign notes acquired in Niger by debit to a Foreign Account in Francs or a foreign currency account, by exchange for other foreign means of payment brought in, or by repurchase with CFA francs (such repurchase being limited to the equivalent of CFAF 25,000). 369 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NIGER and are restricted, but capital receipts from such coun- tries are permitted freely. Special controls (additional to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable) are maintained over borrowing abroad, over inward and outward invest- ment, and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Niger. Such operations require prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. Exempt from authorization, however, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Nigerien Government and (2) shares that are identical with, or may be substituted for, securities whose issuance or sale in Niger has previously been authorized. With the exception of controls over foreign securities, these measures do not apply to relations with France (as defined above), Monaco, member countries of the West African Monetary Union, and the Operations Account countries. Special controls are maintained also over the soliciting of funds for deposit with foreign private persons and foreign firms and institutions, and over publicity aimed at placing funds abroad or at subscribing to real estate development operations abroad; these special controls also apply to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries. All the special provisions described in this paragraph apply only to transactions and not to the associated payments or collections. All investments abroad by residents of Niger require prior authorization by the Minister of Finance;5 75 per- cent of the value must be financed from borrowing abroad. Foreign direct investments in Niger6 must be declared to the Minister of Finance before they are made. The Minister has a period of two months from receipt of the declaration, during which he may request postpone- ment of the project. The full or partial liquidation of either type of investment also requires prior declaration to the Minister. Both the making and the liquidation of investments, whether these are Nigerien investments abroad or foreign investments in Niger, must be reported to the Minister of Finance and the BCEAO within 20 days following each operation. Direct investments con- stitute investments implying control of a company or an enterprise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. Lending abroad is subject to prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. Borrowing by residents from nonresidents requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance.

The repayment of a foreign borrowing constituting a direct investment is subject to the same formalities as the liquidation of a direct investment; the repayment of other borrowings requires authorization only to the extent that the borrowing itself was subject to prior authorization. Foreign investments in Niger may be granted certain guarantees and facilities under the Investment Code of July 31, 1968 and its amending texts. Existing benefits accorded under the previous Investment Code have been maintained. The new Investment Code provides for privileged or regular treatment. The latter provides assurances, for both new and existing enterprises, with respect to indemnities in the event of expropriation and concerning nondiscrimination between Nigerien nation- als and foreign nationals; tax exemptions may be granted for new investments. Privileged treatment is reserved for enterprises deemed to be of special importance to national economic development and falling within specified categories of industrial activities. Such treat- ment may be accorded under two different regimes, the approval regime and the agreement regime. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Niger. Imports and exports of gold from or to any other country require prior authorization by the Minister of Finance, which is seldom granted. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the Treasury or the BCEAO; (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles contain- ing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold- plated articles); and (3) articles of gold up to a combined weight of 500 grams when carried by a traveler. Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Changes During 1984 Imports and Import Payments August 10.

Not for Redistribution NIGERIA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Nigeria is the Nigerian Naira. Nigeria does not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions and pursues an independent and flexible exchange rate policy. The official middle rate for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is determined on the basis of a basket of currencies. Official buying and selling rates are set at 0.25 percent on either side of the middle rate. On December 31, 1984 the middle rate against the U .S. dollar was US$1.2372 per N 1, and the buying and selling rates were US$1.2403 and US$1.2341, respectively, per N 1. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) also quotes daily rates at which it is prepared to deal in pounds sterling. Cross rates are also available for other currencies.l All exchange dealings are for approved transactions and are on a spot basis only.2 There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. However, nongovernmental transactions are subject to a commission of 0.25 percent. For approved transactions, authorized dealers may deal at market rates, spot or forward, between them- selves and with resident and nonresident customers. Authorized dealers may enter freely into contracts with residents of Nigeria for the purchase or sale of any foreign currency for delivery at a fu ture date, provided that the transaction is one that would be acceptable on a spot basis and relates to a firm commercial contract for the import or export of goods, or to freight charges on a specific shipment of goods, and is payable in a foreign currency. Forward contracts related to imports must not extend more than six months beyond the expiration date of the import license, or beyond the date of import when the license has no expiration date or when no license is required. Forward contracts related to exports may cover any necessary period, provided that payment for the goods is to be received within three months of shipment or within such longer period as may have been authorized. Administration of Control The Federal Ministry of Finance is responsible for basic exchange control policy and, in principle, for approving applications for the following: copyrights; the repatriation of capital and transfer of profits; the raising of external loans, including repayment of such loans; borrowing in Nigeria by companies controlled directly or indirectly from outside Nigeria (other than local bank overdrafts to pay for imports); the granting of "approved status" to nonresident investments in Nigeria; and any dealings in foreign securities. The Central Bank is the principal administrator of exchange control. Most com- mercial banks and merchant banks have been appointed as authorized dealers by the Ministry of Finance and are empowered to deal in foreign currencies and to approve applications in accordance with instructions issued by the Central Bank. Any application that does not fall within the scope of the authority of these authorized dealers must be submitted to the Central Bank or, for the transactions mentioned above, to the Ministry of Fi- nance. Certain hotels and rest houses have also been appointed authorized buyers of foreign currency and traveler's checks. All export proceeds and other proceeds in foreign currencies are centralized with the Central Bank. The Central Bank supplies the authorized banks with foreign exchange for approved payments. The administration of trade controls, including is- suance of import licenses, is carried out by the Federal Ministry of Commerce and Industries and the Import Licensing Committee, comprising officials of the Minis- tries of Commerce and Industries, Finance, and Eco- nomic Development, as well as representatives of the Central Bank and the Department of Customs and Excise. Prescription of Currency Authorized payments may be made in naira to an External Account in Nigeria or in any foreign currency. The proceeds of exports to foreign countries may be received in naira from an External Account, in any foreign currency that is freely exchangeable for naira, or in any specified currency. Settlements with the central banks of West African States (for Benin, Burkina Faso, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo) are normally made through the West African Clearing House. Nonresident Accounts3 There are three categories of nonresident accounts: External Accounts, Nonresident Accounts, and Blocked Accounts. External Accounts are maintained for diplo- matic representatives of all countries and international organizations. They may be credited with authorized payments by residents of Nigeria to residents of foreign countries, with payments from other External Accounts, and with proceeds from sales of foreign currencies. They may be debited for payments to residents of Nigeria, !For example, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, French francs, deutsche mark, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, and Swiss francs. 2The Central Bank buys and sells U.S. dollars and pounds sterling and is prepared to buy only those other currencies for which it quotes daily rates. 3 As part of the 1985 federal budget, provisions were introduced for residents of Nigeria (including individuals and corporate bodies) having foreign exchange (other than in the form of export proceeds and payments received by authorized buyers and dealers) to maintain foreign currency accounts domiciled in Nigerian banks. Implementa- tion details of this provision were expected to be issued in due course. 371 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NIGERIA for payments to other External Accounts, and for purchases of foreign currencies. Funds derived from local sources may be deposited in Nonresident Accounts. Such accounts may be credited with proceeds from services rendered locally, provided that the operation of such accounts has been reported to and approval has been obtained from the Central Bank before any foreign transfers are effected. Blocked Accounts are accounts to which are credited funds that are blocked by directives given under Section 27 of the Exchange Control Act. Imports and Import Payments Nigeria's import policies are formulated with the basic objectives of promoting industrialization (protection of local industries), diversifying the economy, and support- ing the balance of payments. Imports are classified into three major categories: prohibited imports, imports subject to licensing requirements, and imports under open general license (OGL).4 Beginning from Feb- ruary 9, 1984, the issuance of OGL is discontinued; all imports are subject to specific import license. The import licensing procedures normally call for (i) the authorities' judgment regarding domestic demand and supply condi- tions for the commodity, and (ii) the issuance of licenses on a first-come-first-served basis to import up to the point where the aggregate value of licenses issued is officially deemed equal to the estimated excess of total domestic demand over domestic production for the respective commodities. Since April 1982, the issuance of licenses has become subject to the additional con- straint of the foreign exchange budget and to a formula which allots to major industrial projects 60 percent of the aggregate value of all licenses issued, 30 percent to distributors according to their geographical location, and 10 percent to emergencies.5 Licenses are granted accord- ing to a priority list which emphasizes raw materials, spare parts, machinery, public goods, and certain major food items such as rice. Licenses generally remain valid until the end of the calendar year in which they are issued. Some licenses, generally for high-value bulky products, are granted for up to half of the value requested and with a validity period that does not extend beyond the middle of the calendar year; however, provided the recipient of such license makes full use of it, an extension is automatically granted in an amount equiva- lent to that originally given, and for a period not to run beyond the calendar year. An import prohibition may be applied if, among other considerations, the authorities arrive at a judgment that domestic requirements can be 4A ll imports from South Africa and Namibia are prohibited. 5 On January 1, 1985, a system was introduced under which licenses would be issued within the context of overall value limits accorded to government imports, food imports, and general goods, with the latter subdivided into industry groupings. Criteria applied in evaluating applications for import licenses by manufacturing industries include: (i) the extent to which the manufacturing industry concerned uses local raw materials; (ii) the foreign exchange earnings generated by the company's products; (iii) the linkage effect of the products of the company to those of other industries; (iv) the amount of capital invested in the company, together with its turnover; and (v) geograph- ical location. 372 fu l ly met by domestic production, or if the items concerned are considered nonessential. Items which may not be imported are subdivided into two categories: those the importation of which is absolutely prohibited, and those which may be imported only as personal effects. The former category contains 20 items, among which are air pistols, counterfeit coins of any country, secondhand clothing, certain types of spirits, meat declared to be un f it for consumption, and indecent or obscene prints. The latter category comprises 68 items, including cigarettes, live poultry (except day- old chicks), vegetables, pastries, fresh fru i t, potatoes, textile fabrics, beer, fresh milk, rice in packets or in containers of less than 50 kilograms, toothpaste, and passenger cars with a c . i . f. value each exceeding N 15,000 or an engine capacity exceeding 2,500 cubic centimeters. An M form, which is an application for foreign exchange, must be completed for all imports into Nigeria, irrespective of value.6 Beginning January 1, 1984, the Central Bank of Nigeria delegated to the authorized dealers the processing, registration, and initial approval of applications by the private sector and public corporations for M forms and selected cases of A forms covering medical travels, basic travel allowance, business travel allowance (suspended for an indefinite period), private membership subscriptions and examina- tion fees, payments for correspondence courses, monthly home remittances by foreign nationals (including leave pay, bonus, and gratuity), pension and provident fund contributions, and tuition and maintenance allowance for private students abroad. M forms relating to merchandise imports of the Federal and State Governments are registered by the Central Bank of Nigeria. A forms relating to the invisible payments of the Federal and State Governments are registered by the Office of Exchange Control at the Ministry of Finance. Each authorized dealer is given a foreign exchange ceiling for the year, and each dealer is required not to exceed one twelfth, on average, of the allocation in each month in the issuance of forms M and A. In registering the M and A forms, the authorized dealers must observe the following allocation coefficients (as a percentage of total allocations): (a) industrial raw materials, machinery, completely knocked-down components and spare parts, 58; (b) food items, 18; (c) general merchandise, 12; and (d) invisibles, 12.7 Final approval of applications for foreign exchange continues to depend upon confirmation by the Central Bank of Nigeria. The Office of Exchange Control in the Central Bank checks all M forms. Prior to 6 As part of the changes introduced on January 1, 1985, an M form would no longer serve as an application for foreign exchange: an import license would guarantee the availability of foreign exchange up to the value stated in the license. Other functions of the M form, however, remained unchanged. 7 On January 1, 1985, the system of foreign exchange allocations to authorized dealers was abolished as were the allocation coefficients. The Central Bank of Nigeria was to ensure that the global and sectoral foreign exchange ceilings, set by the foreign exchange budget, for the entire economy were not exceeded. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution submitting an M form, an importer must have obtained an import license for the goods to be imported; and he must be able to present a tax clearance certificate (showing the settlement of all tax liabilities) covering the previous three years. Each completed M form (in septuplicate) submitted to the Central Bank must be accompanied by a pro forma invoice for the imports, showing the price split into f .o .b. and freight, with all ancillary charges, such as commissions and interest charges, shown separately; in addition, each submitted M form must be supported by a statement showing the M forms already registered in favor of the importer during the past 12 months, together with details of the utilization of such forms, including quantities, values, and the dates of arrival and collection of goods in- volved.8 It is only after an M form has been processed and registered that an importer can confirm his order to the seller. In the absence of a registered M form, a letter of credit may not be opened, nor may any form of payment for imports be effected. On completion of processing, M forms generally remain valid for six months, during which period the items specified must arrive in Nigeria; revalidation beyond the expiry period is granted subject to the validity of the import license. All imports valued at N 1,000 or more are subject to preshipment inspection,9 to ensure that all imports into Nigeria are of the correct quality and quantity according to the contracts, and that only the normal price of that commodity in the country of supply is paid. Unless a "Clean Report of Findings" on the goods to be imported has been issued, foreign exchange settlement for imports may not be effected. With regard to price, the final invoice for the imports does not have to agree with the details declared on the M form, provided that (a) the price is supported in every respect by a Clean Report of Findings issued by a designated preshipment agent, and (b) any increase over the declared M form price does not exceed 10 percent of the declared total c . i .f. amount. Increase in price in excess of 10 percent requires a new M form. However, for goods exempted from preship- ment inspection because of their value, approval for payment will not be granted for more than the value of the original application. 8 As part of the changes introduced on January 1, 1985, authorized dealers were required to endorse the specific import licenses with the total value of the M forms registered by them against the import license, and to ensure that the total value of each specific import license was not exceeded by the value of M forms registered against the license, and that import licenses were utilized for their specified purposes. 9The officially designated companies for the inspection are: Cotecna, Daniel C. Griffith, and OMIC for inspection in Zone A (Australia, Asia, and the United Kingdom); Bureau Veritas and Thionville for inspection in Zone B (Africa and Europe, excluding the United Kingdom); and Swede Control and Intertek Services for inspection in Zone C (the Americas and Canada). The following items are exempted from the inspection requirement: gold, precious stones, objects of art, explosives and pyrotechnic products, ammunition, implements of war, live animals, fresh, chilled, frozen, or tinned fruits and vegetables, scrap metals, household and personal effects, includ- ing used motor vehicles, parcel post or samples, and petroleum and refined petroleum products. NIGERIA When import payments are to be made against confirmed letters of credit, all shipping documents relating to the imported goods must be lodged with the Office of Exchange Control at the Central Bank within 21 days of receipt of the claim cable by the Central Bank. Bills of entry, against cable claims, must be submitted to the Central Bank within 90 days of the Bank's receipt of the cable. All other means of payment require submission to the Central Bank of the fu ll set of documents, evidencing the receipt of the goods in Nigeria. Under normal circumstances, the completed "package" of documents is processed within 2—7 days. If the Central Bank is satisfied with all the documents, the Office of Exchange Control will issue a foreign ex- change release order (an accepted M form) to the Foreign Operations Department of the Central Bank. However, an ad hoc reinspection of the documents can be underta- ken in consultation with the Foreign Operations Depart- ment before a foreign exchange release order is issued. With the exception of some payments made by the Central Bank for the Government, foreign exchange is released to authorized dealers, allowing them to effect payment for imports or to reimburse their correspondent banks for import payments already made. Other than against letters of credit, payment for imports may also be made against bills for collection, intercompany open accounts, usance bills, or most other credit terms arranged between importers and exporters. Import con- tracts requiring deferred payments or installments need approval from the Central Bank for private sector imports and from the Ministry of Finance for public sector imports. Prepayment for imports is prohibited.10 Certain import payments have been delayed. Subject to the availability of funds, the Central Bank releases foreign exchange against accepted M forms or A forms on a "first-in, first-out" basis, and according to the following priority categories: (a) payments for the servicing of the external debt, medical bills, business travel allowances, seminars, personal home remittances, school fees, and certain obligations of the Nigerian Airlines and Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation; (b) payments for importation against letter of credit of raw materials, books, spare parts, medicine, and other essential goods; and (c) all other payments. Settlement of the interest charges is usually effected when the arrears are settled. Settlement of arrears is made at the exchange rate prevailing on the settlement date. Arrears on payments due to commercial banks (on letters of credit) have been subject to consolidation agreements. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to residents of other countries are subject to individual approval; for some categories of invisibles this is granted by authorized dealers, either up to specified limits or up to the amount of the bill or 10 On January 2, 1985, it was announced that a system of advance payment of import duties would be introduced in 1985; detailed guidelines on the implementation of this requirement were to be issued to authorized dealers as soon as possible. 373 ©International Monetary Fund.

New profits and dividends may be remitted as soon as they are declared, provided that, in the case of airline and shipping companies, a tax at the rate of 10 percent is paid. The tax is held on account until corporate tax returns are assessed and filed. Remittances of technical fees, management fees, and royalties are permitted when it can be shown that these are related to the import of modern technol- ogy. Payments for technical and management fees require approval by the Ministry of Finance. A max- imum of 2 percent of profit before tax is permitted.11 For new companies a lump sum is applied in lieu of the 2 percent of profit before tax for the first three years. Similar policies are applicable to other payments for services, such as those relating to copyrights and trademarks. In the case of royalties, exchange allowance is based on volume of sales, subject to a maximum of 1 percent, except for books and musical records, which are treated on a case-by-case basis in relation to international practice. Foreign consultants performing professional services in Nigeria are allowed to remit to their associates abroad up to 20 percent of the amount contracted. Applications for payments that cannot be approved by authorized dealers and are not among those (such as profits and dividends) that require approval by the Ministry of Finance are forwarded to the Central Bank for decision. An A form, which is subject to a similar review process as an M form, must be filed with the Central Bank for all invisible payments. All insurance other than that for which facilities do not exist in Nigeria must be taken out with a company in Nigeria. Residents are entitled to a basic travel allowance in foreign exchange up to a limit equivalent to N 100 a person a year (there is no allowance for children under 16 years). There is also a separate allowance for pilgrims; each pilgrim 16 years and older is entitled to a maximum of N 800. The basic travel allowance and that for the pilgrims are mutually exclusive; that is, no individual may obtain the two in one fiscal year. Foreign exchange for these purposes may be sold to residents by authorized dealers. In addition, travel agents and ship- ping and airline companies in Nigeria may sell transpor- tation tickets for any destination against payment in Nigerian currency. The cost of services rendered by travel agents in respect of hotel accommodation, meals en route, etc., must be covered from the basic travel allowance. Foreign exchange is no longer made avail- able for medical treatment abroad, unless the need for such treatment is certified by the Chief Medical Officer of the State where the applicant is resident (on the recommendation of the State Medical Board), and 11 On January 1, 1985, a regulation was introduced making outward remittances in respect of technical services and management fees (within the limit of 2 percent of profit before tax) subject to annual submission of a detailed report describing the state of implementation of the provisions of the respective agreements. 374 subject to a letter from an overseas doctor or hospital indicating acceptance for such treatment and stating bills payable and the number of days of stay for medical treatment abroad. No official sales of foreign exchange are made to new students intending to follow under- graduate or professional courses abroad; such sales are allowed only for postgraduate courses abroad, provided that (a) the recipient is sponsored by the Government or by some official agency, and (b) the courses are not available at Nigerian universities. Students who on January 1, 1984 were attending universities or institu- tions of higher learning abroad and had previously been granted foreign exchange are, however, exempted from the new regulations, provided that their applications for foreign exchange are accompanied by adequate docu- mentation, including a letter from a Nigerian Embassy or High Commission abroad; if appropriate documentation is presented, exceptions to this regulation may be made for students who have not previously received remit- tances of foreign exchange. Foreign exchange allow- ances for elementary school education abroad are not granted except in special cases, such as those of handicapped children for whom educational facilities are not available locally. Exchange applications for most nontourist travel must be submitted to the Central Bank. Remittances by residents for g ift purposes are limited to N 150 a year for individuals and N 500 for charitable organizations. Foreign nationals residing in Nigeria may purchase annually foreign currency up to 25 percent of their net income for all personal remittances (including insurance, education, medical expenses, proceeds from sales of assets, provident fund contributions, sundry payments, and the basic travel allowance); applications in excess of this limit are examined on their merits by the Central Bank. When taking overseas leave, foreign nationals may also convert up to two months' pay into foreign exchange. Residents are permitted to take out the equivalent of their basic travel allowance in foreign currency notes and traveler's checks; nonresident visitors may take out any foreign currency notes and traveler's checks that were declared upon entry, minus the amount converted locally into Nigerian currency. Travelers may take out N 20 in domestic notes and coin; all other export of Nigerian currency notes and coin is prohibited. Exports and Export Proceeds Nigeria's export policy aims to assist local (particu- larly agricultural) producers, and to buttress the nation's import policies. Consequently, certain exports are pro- hibited, while others are subject to licensing require- ments.12 The exportation of 11 items is absolutely prohibited; these include beans, maize, rice, milk, groundnut oil, and all imported food products. In addition, the export of African antiques, works of art, and objects used (or which have been used) in African 2Exports to South Africa and Namibia are prohibited. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ceremonies is prohibited, except under prescribed condi- tions. A further list of 36 products may be exported only under license. These latter products include cigarettes and tobacco, unrefined gold, petroleum products, raw cocoa beans, raw cotton, groundnuts, cottonseed cake, oil and meal and palm kernel cake, meal, and oil. The sale abroad of all export crops purchased by the Marketing Boards (cocoa, cotton, groundnuts, and palm kernels) is the responsibility of each Board under the general guidance of the Export Commodity Coordinating Council. Exports of petroleum are handled by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and are subject to special arrangements. Export proceeds must be surrendered, through an authorized dealer, to the Central Bank within three months of shipment. For all exports, the exporter is required to submit an exchange control declaration at the time of shipment. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in foreign currencies must be sold to an authorized dealer, for surrender to the Central Bank. Persons entering Nigeria may freely bring in for- eign bank notes, but must cash such foreign currency with an authorized dealer who must, in turn, surrender it to the Central Bank. Travelers may bring in N 20 in domestic currency; all other import of Nigerian currency notes and coins is prohibited. Capital Except for the purpose of financing imports or exports, permission is required from the Ministry of Finance for any individual, firm, company, or branch resident in Nigeria to borrow abroad. In addition, official agencies and state-controlled corporations require the prior approval of the Ministry of Finance for any foreign borrowing. The contracting of suppliers' credit abroad by state-controlled corporations or agencies also is subject to approval by the Ministry of Finance. The permission of the Ministry of Finance is required for borrowing in Nigeria (1) by any nonresident individual or company and (2) by any company registered in Nigeria (other than a bank) which is controlled directly or indirectly from outside Nigeria. However, to enable entities mentioned under (2) to meet temporary shortages of funds, licensed banks in Nigeria may grant loans or overdrafts for periods not exceeding 14 days, or may increase the amount of any advance or overdraft by the amount of loan interest or bank charges payable thereon. General permission is also given for any loan, bank overdraft, or other credit facility to be arranged to finance Nigerian imports or exports of goods. Residents of Nigeria may not deal in foreign currency securities or buy from or sell to nonresidents of Nigeria any security payable in naira without the permission of the Ministry of Finance. The capital proceeds of securi- ties registered in Nigeria and owned by nonresidents may NIGERIA be collected and negotiated through authorized dealers, provided that the prior permission of the Ministry of Finance is obtained. Exchange for the transfer of certain assets by emi- grants or repatriates is granted on final departure from the country, but the transfer of the proceeds of assets realized in order to comply with the Nigerian Enterprises Promotion Decrees of 1972 and 1977 may take place upon receipt. Ceilings for foreign capital participation in the equity capital of enterprises in various sectors of the economy have been set by the Indigenization Decree of 1974, as amended in June 1976 and January 1977. Nonresidents intending to make direct investments in Nigeria may apply to the Ministry of Finance for approved status, the granting of which means that sympathetic consideration will be given to future requests to repatriate the capital and related profits and dividends.13 The granting of approved status is not applicable to the purchase of shares on the stock exchange in Nigeria unless this forms an integral part of the approved investment project. Furthermore, this status is not normally granted when internally generated funds from profits, dividends, rents, or bank credit or locally raised loans are invested in local enterprises. With minor exceptions, foreign-owned com- panies and commercial banks operating in Nigeria must be incorporated in Nigeria. The repatriation of foreign capital requires approval from the Ministry of Finance. Gold With permission of the Federal Ministry of Finance, residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Nigeria for numismatic purposes. Residents other than the monetary authorities, producers of gold, and authorized industrial users are not allowed, without special permission, to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry or coin, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require specific licenses issued by the Ministry of Finance; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, producers of gold, and industrial users. Furthermore, the import of U .K. gold coin requires a license from the Commissioner of Customs and Excise, and the import of other gold coin requires a specific import license. Imports of gold coin and gold and silver bullion are free of duty when made by the Central Bank; otherwise, such imports are subject to customs duty at 100 percent ad valorem. Changes During 1984 Imports and Import Payments Quantitative Import Restrictions January 1. Preimport processing and registration of form M applications in respect of the private sector and 13 Among the changes introduced on January 1, 1985 was a regulation specifying that dividends due to nonresident investors could be invested in new local companies, provided that an additional amount equal to half of the remittable amount was imported; the additional capital inflow was required to enable the investor to qua l i fy for "approved status." 375 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NIGERIA parastatals was delegated to authorized dealers ( i .e ., banks). All applications would still have to be checked by the Central Bank (which had the power to authorize) before disbursement can be effected. In connection with this change in procedures, each authorized dealer was to be given an allocation of foreign exchange for the year. In addition, a list of priority import categories was specified as follows, for the purpose of registration of form M applications: (a) essential raw materials; (b) spare parts; (c) essential food items; (d) medica- ments; (e) books, laboratory equipment, and profes- sional journals; (f) capital goods; and (g) other consumer goods. Dealers were required to take into account the geographical location of the importer, shipment date, past record of form M utilization, and the expiry date of the import license. February 9. The issuance of Open General Licenses was discontinued and all allowable imports were placed under specific import license. Import Surcharges and Import Taxation July 31. A new Custom and Excise Tariff Code was introduced with the aim of equalizing effective rates of protection across industries. The new Code reduced the number of tariff levels and narrowed the tariff band. Advance Import Deposits January 1. All imports, other than rice and petroleum, whether or not financed with credit facilities of over six months, were made subject to the applicable advance import deposit; the deposits were made payable at the point of registration of form M. May 9. The compulsory advance deposit requirement was abolished. Other Measures Affecting Imports January 1. The threshold value of import goods subject to preshipment inspection was lowered to N = 1,000. In addition, the maximum commissions payable to agents or confirming houses acting as inter- mediaries between importers and exporters was reduced from 4 percent to 2 percent of the f .o .b. value of consignment. January 1. Prepayment for imports by the private sector and public corporations was prohibited. September 30. The designation of the Societe Gene- rale de Surveillance, S .A. (SGS) as the preshipment inspection company for Nigeria was cancelled. The SGS was replaced by five other designated companies; name- ly, Cotecna of Switzerland, Daniel C. Griffith of the United Kingdom, OMIC of Japan, Bureau Veritas and Thionville of France, and Swede Control and Intertek Services of Sweden. Current Invisibles January 1. The following changes were made in regulations affecting invisible payments: (a) outward payments for technical services and management con- tracts would no longer be allowed unless in exceptionally deserving cases such as manufacturing companies in- volving use of high technology; (b) payment of consul- tancy fees for prefeasibility and feasibility studies would no longer be allowed within the limit of 20 percent of project value allowed for consultancy fees in general; (c) while the remittable limit of 50 percent of an expatriate's net income would continue to apply, and while final departure expatriates would continue to be allowed to export balances of unremitted limits, terminal pay, and gratuity, henceforth the remittance of proceeds from sales of assets would be allowed only within the overall remittable limit; (d) the basic travel allowance was reduced from N 500 to N 100 a person a year, and the allowance for business travel was suspended indefi- nitely; (e) foreign exchange allowance for medical treatment outside of Nigeria was abolished, except in cases of requests certified by the Chief Medical Officer of the applicant's State of residence; and (f) discontinua- tion of foreign exchange allowance for undergraduate or professional courses abroad. (Students already studying abroad would be allowed to continue to receive foreign exchange to complete their studies; for postgraduate courses, foreign exchange would only be made available where such courses were not available at Nigerian universities.) May 9. The maximum amount of outward remittance by expatriates employed in the public or private sector was reduced from 50 percent to 25 percent of net income. May 9. The maximum amount of naira which could be taken out of Nigeria to facilitate payment for minor expenses on return from overseas travel was reduced from N 50 to N 20. 376 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NORWAY (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Norway is the Norwegian Krone. The external value of the krone is pegged to a currency index number reflecting the average change in the exchange rates of the 14 currencies most important to Norway's external trade and payments. The exchange rate is managed so as to allow only limited fluctuations around the benchmark for the effective value. The weights of the index are, in principle, based on Norway's exports of processed goods to each of the countries whose curren- cies are included, taking also into account competitive relations with third countries. The exchange rate of the krone for the U .S. dollar, the principal intervention currency, is quoted daily, together with those of 18 other currencies, on the basis of the market rates. On Decem- ber 31, 1984 the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were NKr 9.0760 and NKr 9.0980, respectively, per US$1. Forward premiums and discounts are left to the interplay of market forces. Forward transactions with nonbank residents by authorized banks and foreign exchange brokers must have a commercial basis. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Norway formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from May 11, 1967. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Ministry of Finance and Customs in cooperation with the Bank of Norway. Most current payments are exempt from ex- change control, provided that they are made through authorized banks in accordance with the currency pre- scriptions issued by the Bank of Norway. Authority to conduct most current payments has been delegated to authorized banks, which report such payments to the Bank of Norway. Import and export licenses, when required, are issued by the Ministry of Trade and Shipping and, in certain cases, by the Ministry of Agriculture or the Ministry of Fisheries. Prescription of Currency Settlements with all countries may be made in any convertible currency, including Norwegian kroner in Convertible Krone Accounts (see section on Nonresident Accounts, below). Nonresident Accounts The main type of nonresident account is the Convert- ible Krone Account. Such accounts may be held by residents of all countries. They may be credited with authorized payments from any country, with transfers from other Convertible Krone Accounts, and with proceeds from the sale in Norway of convertible curren- cies. They may be debited for authorized payments from any country to residents of Norway, for transfers to other Convertible Krone Accounts, and for purchases in Norway of any foreign currency. Authorized banks are permitted to open foreign exchange accounts for nonresi- dents, subject to the regulations on such accounts (see section on Capital, below). * Imports and Import Payments Most commodities do not require an import license. Certain textiles and garments are subject to import licensing for surveillance purposes. Following Norway's accession to the current Multi-Fiber Agreement on July 1, 1984, the global quotas formerly in force under Article XIX of the GATT are being phased out. In this connection, Norway has concluded bilateral agreements with 15 textile suppliers and negotiations are going on for the others. Beside textile products, there are licensing requirements for a few industrial import items from Japan and the Republic of Korea, and for certain additional products from Taiwan.t With these excep- tions, industrial goods may be imported freely upon presentation of the original invoice. Imports of certain agricultural goods are restricted, irrespective of origin. A global quota list contains a few quotas for agricultural products for which imports are permitted up to fixed limits; these quotas apply to all countries. New and secondhand ships other than ships that are 20 years old or older, and certain categories of fishing vessels, may be imported freely, but special permission is required in order to ensure compliance with the regulations regarding payments in advance of delivery. The import of radio equipment and radio control equipment is subject to approval by the Direc- torate of Telecommunications. The import of a small number of commodities is prohibited for health and similar reasons, and certain goods (some grains, alco- holic beverages, fishing gear made of textile materials, pharmaceutical products, and drugs) are imported by government monopolies. Payments for Invisibles Payments to any country for all current invisibles, including income from capital and contractual amortiza- tion, may be made freely. There are no limits on the basic exchange allowance for tourist travel abroad. For business travel, the banks may sell reasonable amounts of foreign exchange. Each person leaving Norway may take with him up to NKr 5,000 in Norwegian bank notes. Nonresidents leaving Norway may, in addition, export any foreign bank notes brought into the country by them. 1 Residents also may open foreign exchange accounts. The customer must have both income and expenditure in foreign currencies. Holdings in these accounts must not exceed the amount required to cover obligations due in the immediate fu tu re. t See Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part Two, page 54. 377 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NORWAY Exports and Export Proceeds Most goods may be exported freely to any country against a declaration or a license. Exports subject to regulation are listed and require export licenses. Exports valued at not more than NKr 2,000 to any country are exempt from declaration or export license; for arms and ammunition this limit is NKr 500, and for fish and fish products Nkr 1,000. If payment is not received within 12 months of delivery, a license from the Bank of Norway is required. In principle, all exchange from exports must be surrendered. Proceeds from Invisibles In principle, receipts from invisibles must be surren- dered. A person entering Norway may bring in any amount in Norwegian currency and in other means of payment. Capital Inward transfers of capital and investments in Norway by nonresidents must be approved by the Bank of Norway. The regulation of inward direct investment in connection with transfer of share capital is based on a reporting system. Outward transfers of capital require individual licenses; the granting of these licenses de- pends on the merits of the case. Licenses for outward transfers of proceeds from the sale or liquidation of investments made in Norway by nonresidents are granted freely, and nonresident capital may be repatriated auto- matically. Payments for contractual amortization are also permitted freely. Most transactions in securities involv- ing nonresident interests are subject to approval. Nonres- idents are allowed to purchase nonquoted as well as quoted shares within the limit of the Concession Acts and the respective companies' Articles of Association. However, permission for foreigners to purchase Norwe- gian bonds (within specified limits) has been revoked. Personal capital transfers, such as transfers relating to family loans, gifts, inheritances, legacies, dowries, emigrants' assets, savings of nonresident workers, and amounts in settlement of immigrants' debts, may be made freely. In general, resident-owned capital assets abroad, other than securities, real estate, and other authorized invest- ments, have to be surrendered. Norwegian shipowners, insurance companies, and brokers may open accounts of 30 days' maturity with foreign banks; upon special permission from the Bank of Norway, other Norwegian firms may also hold such accounts. On special applica- tion, permission may be given by the Bank for Norwe- gian firms having long-term currency debt to hold time deposits abroad in foreign currency and to purchase foreign bonds quoted on recognized stock exchanges, without limit on the maturity of such assets. Applications for capital transfers to make direct investments abroad are treated liberally. Residents are allowed to purchase quoted and nonquoted foreign 378 shares. However, purchase of nonquoted shares requires a licence. Purchase of foreign bonds in general continues to be prohibited.2 Residents may, upon application, transfer capital abroad to purchase real estate for recrea- tional purposes. There are no nominal limits on authorized banks' borrowing abroad, but authorized banks have to balance their combined spot and forward positions in foreign currency at the end of the day within narrow margins varying between banks according to their role in the foreign exchange market. Banks are permitted to hold positions in any currency that is covered in other currencies. A license from the Ministry of Finance and Customs is required to raise bond loans in foreign countries. Borrowing abroad in connection with imports of ships must be approved by the Ministry of Trade and Ship- ping. All other inward transfers of capital by nonbank residents require approval by the Bank of Norway. Incurring or providing guarantee obligations abroad also requires approval by the Bank of Norway. With the exception of loans to the petroleum sector, shipping, and shipyards, new foreign borrowing by Norwegian com- mercial enterprises must be within specified overall limits. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form. No customs duties or other charges or fees are payable on imports or exports of gold bullion and gold coin not contained in jewelry. Domestic sales of gold bullion and gold coin are subject to the regular value- added tax at a rate of 20 percent. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement July 2. Exchange rates were allowed to move during late June 1984 in such a way that the exchange rate index reached a level of 101.1 by this date, representing a depreciation of 1 percent compared with the base level. In addition, the computational basis of the index was changed from an arithmetic to a geometric average; with unchanged data, this yielded an index level of 98.9. (The following day the index was moved to 100, representing a further depreciation of 1 percent.) July 9. In an easing of the conditions attached to the use of currency options as permitted beginning from September 26, 1983, it was announced that upon application, authorized banks would henceforth receive general consent from Norges Bank to write currency options for nonbank residents over a contract period. Such consent would imply that, in addition to covering a foreign exchange risk during the period of an offer or tender, currency options could be employed under the same rules as applied for forward foreign exchange transactions. 2 Residents are allowed to purchase Euro-krone bonds in the secondary market. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution September 22. The exchange rate index was moved to a level of 102 (close to the lower limit), representing a depreciation of the krone by 2 percent. Imports and Import Payments July 1. Norway joined the Multi-Fiber Agreement (MFA III). In this connection, the global quotas (under Article XIX of the GATT) formerly in force were to be phased out, and bilateral agreements were concluded with 15 textile suppliers. The bilateral agreements allowed for some increase in imports liberalization (especially for smaller suppliers) relative to the former global quotas. In addition, the automatic licensing procedures used by Norway for monitoring trade in certain products and applied to textile and clothing imports not covered by quotas or bilateral agreements were discontinued for several dozen specific items, including a group of rubber products. Payments for Invisibles June 15. The limit of NKr 10,000 on purchases of foreign exchange for individual trips abroad was abolished. June 15. The limit on Norwegian notes that residents and nonresidents traveling abroad could take along with them was raised from NKr 2,000 to NKr 5,000. Capital June 8. Legislation was passed accepting the recom- mendations of a Royal Commission that a small number of foreign banks be allowed to set up subsidiaries in Norway. (Applications from a total of ten banks had been received by the September 1, 1984 deadline, but the review process had not been completed.) In princi- ple, the activities of foreign-owned banks would be subject to the same general conditions as existing Norwegian banks. June 12. In an easing of the limits on banks' overall forward exchange position (spot plus forward), banks quoting binding buying and selling rates for the main currencies against kroner (spot and forward) on a NORWAY continual basis were granted a margin of fluctuation of NKr 200 million. For other banks, lower margins of fluctuation were specified, graduated in relation to their respective total assets. June 15. The following measures were introduced: (a) permission was granted for residents to purchase quoted and nonquoted foreign shares, but purchases of nonquoted shares were made subject to licenses; (b) non- residents were allowed to purchase nonquoted as well as quoted shares, within the limit of the Concession Acts and the respective companies' Articles of Association; (c) permission was granted for residents to purchase Euro-krone bonds in the secondary market, but pur- chases of foreign bonds in general continued to be prohibited; (d) the limit of NKr 400,000 on purchase of real estate for recreational purposes was abolished and the ban on borrowing abroad in connection with such purchase was lifted; (e) the licensing system for inward direct investments in connection with transfer of share capital was replaced by a reporting system, thus basing the regulation of such investments henceforth on the Concession Acts and other relevant legislation; and (f) the ban on import credits of up to five years' maturity provided by foreign financial institutions was lifted. November 28. The following measures were an- nounced as part of the 1985 National Budget: - (a) Norwegian banks would be allowed to grant krone- denominated loans to nonresidents, provided that such applicants had obtained license from Norges Bank; a quota of NKr 5,000 million for such loans (including loans to oil companies on the Norwegian shelf) was fixed for 1985 (the measure was contingent on the foreign exchange reserves remaining at a satisfactory level); (b) residents would be allowed to buy foreign bonds from abroad, up to a limit to be fixed per investor (the specific implementation provisions of the measure were to be determined early in 1985); and (c) the rules for maintaining private working accounts in foreign cur- rency were to be eased. November 15. The permission for foreigners to pur- chase Norwegian bonds up to certain limits was revoked. 379 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution OMAN (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Oman is the Rial Omani, which is pegged to the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, at RO 1 = US$2.89524. Oman avails itself of wider margins. The Central Bank of Oman maintains fixed buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar; on Decem- ber 31, 1984 these rates were RO 1 = US$2.89813 and RO 1 = US$2.89234, respectively. The commercial banks' rates for other currencies are based on market rates in London. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Oman informed the Fund on June 19, 1974 that it formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sec- tions 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control Exchange control authority is vested in the Central Bank, but there is no exchange control legislation in Oman. Prescription of Currency All settlements with Israel and South Africa are prohibited, and the use of their currencies is also prohibited. No other prescription of currency require- ments are in force. Nonresident Accounts No distinction is made between accounts held by residents and those held by nonresidents. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Israel and South Africa are pro- hibited. Imports of a few commodities are prohibited for reasons of health, security, or public policy. In addition, companies operating in Oman and trading in manufac- tured oil products are prohibited from importing such products as long as the domestic refinery is deemed by Oman to be producing the specified products in quanti- tites that satisfy local demand. Licenses are required for imports; exchange for payments abroad for authorized imports may be obtained freely. other commodities may be exported freely. There are no requirements attached to receipts from exports or re- exports; the proceeds need not be repatriated or surren- dered, and they may be disposed of freely, regardless of the currency involved. Exports of Maria Theresa dollars are prohibited. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments for and proceeds from invisibles are not restricted. Payments must not, however, be made to or be received from Israel or South Africa. Travelers may bring in or take out any amount in domestic or foreign bank notes. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or payments by residents or nonresidents, except that no payments may be made to or received from Israel or South Africa. Investment in business firms in Oman by foreign physical or juridical persons requires prior approval. Such investment is regulated by a foreign investment law enacted in June 1983, and by a law for the Organization and Encouragement of Industry, which came into effect on January 15, 1979. Under the 1983 foreign investment law, joint ventures are offered a five- year tax holiday, renewable for an additional period of five years under certain conditions; the Oman Devel- opment Bank can provide medium- and long-term loans at preferential interest rates for project financing in petroleum, agricultural, fishery, and mineral sectors; and assistance in pceinvestment research can also be given. Foreign investment is not permitted in trade and ser- vices, and foreign capital is encouraged to be directed to large production or manufacturing projects. Gold The monetary authorities and authorized resident and nonresident banks may, without license, purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form at home or abroad. They may also import and export gold in any form without a license and without payment of any customs duties or tax. Transactions involving Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited, and exports or re-exports of live animals' and foodstuffs may be prohibited in times of shortage in Oman.

Not for Redistribution PAKISTAN (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Pakistan is the Pakistan Rupee, for which the U.S. dollar is the intervention currency, A managed floating exchange rate system is operated, under which the State Bank of Pakistan (the central bank) sets on a daily basis the rate at which it will purchase and sell U .S. dollars in its dealings with authorized dealers. On December 31, 1984 the State Bank's buying and selling rates for transactions with authorized dealers were PRs 15.3600 and PRs 15.3756, respectively, per US$1. All transactions with the public in foreign exchange must be conducted through autho- rized dealers and money changers, whose dealings must be effected at rates authorized by the State Bank. In calculating spot exchange rates for other currencies, a margin of 0.0625 percent is provided on either side of the mean rate, based on the previous day's closing buying and selling rates for the currency concerned in the New York market. Authorized dealers in Pakistan are permitted to cover their requirements of specified currencies in foreign exchange markets abroad. They may also cover their permitted transactions in specified currencies against U .S. dollars or Pakistan rupees, either spot or forward for a limited period, with their agents in the countries concerned. In addition, they offer forward cover in the currencies of member countries for exports and imports effected under the Asian Clearing Union arrangement, with the State Bank standing ready to cover forward contracts reported by authorized dealers. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases and sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control The State Bank has delegated authority to a number of banks and financial institutions to deal in all foreign currencies, to supervise surrender requirements, and to sell exchange for specified purposes within limits pre- scribed by the State Bank. The Chief Controller of Imports and Exports is responsible for the issue of licenses and permits, as well as the implementation of import and export policies. Certain foreign trade transac- tions are conducted through various state-trading agen- cies, such as the Trading Corporation of Pakistan, Ltd. (TCP), the Cotton Export Corporation, Ltd. (CECP), and the Rice Export Corporation, Ltd. (RECP). Prescription of Currency Exchange receipts and payments abroad must be effected through an authorized foreign exchange dealer, in principle, in any convertible currency or in Pakistan rupees from or to nonresident rupee bank accounts. Certain settlements with specified countries are chan- neled through special accounts. Letters of credit for imports from all other countries must be established in foreign currency or in Pakistan rupees for credit to a nonresident bank account of the country of the benefi- ciary or of the country of origin or shipment of goods. Trade transactions under "barter" agreements are settled through special accounts in inconvertible curren- cies. Trade in specified commodities with Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Poland, Sweden, and the U .S .S .R. is settled through special nonconvertible accounts. The special accounts with the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Sweden, and the U .S .S .R. are maintained in nonconvertible U .S. dollars, and the special account with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is denominated in deutsche mark. Payments to and from the Islamic Republic of Iran and Turkey relating to visible trade (excluding border trade and defense materials) are settled through clearing accounts maintained by the respective central banks in U .S. dollars. Payments to, and receipts from, member countries of the Asian Clearing Union other than the Islamic Republic of Iran (i.e., Bangladesh, Burma, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka) in respect of current transactions (other than those relating to petroleum, natural gas, and their products) may be effected in Asian Monetary Units through the Asian Clearing Union or in the domestic currency of one of the member countries involved in such transactions. No exchange control is exercised over transactions with Afghanistan, and set- tlements are made in Pakistan rupees or in Afghan currency. Payments between Pakistan and Israel and South Africa are suspended. Nonresident Accounts The accounts of individuals, firms, or companies resident outside Pakistan are designated as nonresident accounts. * Authorized banks are permitted to open nonresident accounts for nonbank nonresidents without the prior approval of the State Bank where the accounts are to be opened with funds received from abroad through banking channels or with rupee funds that have been accepted for remittance abroad. Debits and credits to nonresident accounts for specified purposes may be made by authorized banks without the prior approval of the State Bank.

A deposit holder wishing to make payments in Pakistan must first convert the foreign exchange drawn from his account into Pakistan rupees. If a Pakistani national holding such an account returns to Pakistan, he may retain the account unless his stay exceeds six months; thereafter, the account must be closed and the exchange surrendered. Banks in Pakistan receiving such deposits must sell the foreign exchange to the State Bank. Imports and Import Payments The 1984/85 Import Policy Order (IPO) outlines the regulations applicable to imports.2 The IPO divides imports into two categories: prohibited imports and restricted imports. All imports which do not appear either on the prohibited (negative) list or restricted list are freely importable (except that some imports can only be imported by industrial users). The negative list consists essentially of items banned for religious, secu- rity, or luxury consumption reasons; capital and con- sumer goods banned temporarily for protective reasons; and intermediate goods used mainly in the production of capital and consumer goods banned for protective rea- sons.3 The restricted list of imports consists of three categories: (1) 27 items or categories of goods import- able only by the public sector; (2) 20 items or categories importable only from specified sources under credits, baiter trade, loans, or the U .S. P.L. 480 program; and (3) consumer items (arms and ammunition, butter, condensed, preserved, and powdered milk, milk food for infants, malted milk, and Oval tine or similar products) subject to quantitative restrictions. Imports of some items on the negative list are permitted under certain circumstances, principally by export industries and public sector agencies, or under the personal baggage scheme. All imports require license permits, except goods imported by the Central Government for defense or other purposes, goods in transit, personal baggage, certain imports over the land routes from Afghanistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran, and certain other items permitted under a Ministry of Commerce Notification. Licenses are issued on the basis of notification by the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports.4 Generally, licenses remain valid for 12 months bu t, when ma- chinery is specifically manufactured, licenses can be 2 Effective Ju ly 1, 1983 the 1983/84 IPO instituted a basic change in the import regime, from a positive list system to a negative list system. 3 Some categories of currently prohibited imports fall outside these categories ( i .e ., some prohibited items are not produced in Pakistan and they do not fit into the category of goods banned for religious, security, or luxury consumption reasons). 4Licensing restrictions are applicable to arms and ammunition, milk products, and Ovaltine. 382 obtained with a validity period of up to 24 months. Licenses for imports are subject to a fee of 2 percent of the value of the license, payable at the time of issue. The import regime is subject to certain other supple- mentary qualifications, the most important of which are as follows: (1) Imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited, as are imports of goods originating in these countries but shipped from third countries. The private sector can import from India 42 specified items through the TCP. Imports of other nonprohibited goods from India (including goods of Indian origin from a third country) are allowed only for the public sector. (2) Dates may be imported only from Iraq. (3) Special provisions exist for the import by export industries of items on the restricted (tied) list from nontied sources and items on the negative list. Machinery on the negative list may also be imported by nonexporting industries up to specified amounts. (4) Private sector importers, other than those importing goods for personal use, who apply for import licenses for goods valued at PRs 20,000 or more, must be members of approved trade organizations. (5) The maximum c. & f. values for which licenses for the import of machinery and mill work can be issued against various sources of financing to different categories are (a) up to PRs 2.5 million, for commercial importers, subject to value restrictions of PRs 0.25 million a un it of machinery or spares; (b) up to PRs 50 million, for new units involving a total capital outlay of PRs 300 million and not falling within the specified list of industries ( i .e ., those which are permitted to be set up without sanction of any government agency); (c) up to PRs 2.5 million, for new units not covered by (b) above; (d) up to PRs 308 million, for expansion of existing units not falling within the specified list of industries; (e) up to PRs 2.5 million, for expansion of existing units not covered by (d) above; and (f) up to PRs 5 million, for licenses for balancing, modernization, and replacement of a unit. Procurement of plant and equipment of a higher value is effected by the financing institutions, with the approval of the Ministry of Industry. Except for imports of books, journals, periodicals, and magazines, irrevocable letters of credit must be opened for all commercial imports. In principle, such letters of credit have to be opened within 60 days after registration of the license with the State Bank for private and public sector imports, or in the case of imports under barter agreements within such period as may be specified in related official Public Notices. For imports under tied loans or credits, which require that the contract be approved by the Economic Affairs Division or another specified agency, licenses for both private and public sector imports remain valid for the opening of a letter of credit for 30 days after final approval of the contract. Oil companies and refineries are free to open letters of credit for the import of crude oil and petroleum products within the validity period of the underlying license. Remit- tances are not normally permitted before shipping docu- ments are received, but in special cases, e .g ., machinery and other capital goods for which deposits have to be ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution paid to foreign manufacturers, the State Bank may authorize advance payments for a part of the value of the goods. Authorized dealers may also make advance remittances, without prior approval of the State Bank of Pakistan, for imports of books, magazines, and journals by commercial importers. No payments are permitted for goods originating in or consigned from Israel or South Africa. With specified exceptions,5 the State Bank requires banks to take minimum margins against import letters of credit at the following rates: 25 percent for milk and cream (including baby food) and butter; and 35 percent for synthetic yarn and all items not listed above. Imports by the TCP are exempt from the margin requirements on import letters of credit. However, domestic letters of credit opened in favor of the TCP in relation to the import of any commodities through the TCP (except bleaching powder and imports under the Raw Material Replenishment (RMR) Scheme) are subject to the same minimum margin requirements as are prescribed for import letters of credit for these commodities. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles are controlled by the State Bank and in many cases require its prior approval. No remittances are permitted to Israel or South Africa. Authorized dealers may sell exchange or make remit- tances in accordance with the regulations. Certain remittances of a personal nature are subject to annual quotas, but applications in excess of the quotas may be approved at the discretion of the State Bank. Remit- tances by Pakistani nationals to their families abroad require special authorization. Payments for invisibles connected with imports are generally given the same treatment as that accorded to the underlying trade transaction. Except with respect to certain aid shipments, transport insurance must be taken out with insurance companies in Pakistan. Commissions, brokerage, or other trade charges paid to foreign import- ers or agents by Pakistani exporters are generally limited to a maximum of 5 percent of the invoice value, except 5 Industrial raw materials imported by industrial or commercial users, industrial machinery (including all capital goods but excluding consumer durables), agricultural machinery and components and spares of such machinery, raw materials used by iron, steel, and shipbreaking industries, all raw materials imported by manufacturers of electrical equipment, capital goods and engineering goods (including cycles and agricultural implements), chassis of trucks, buses, jeeps in completely knocked-down condition, construction and engineering equipment, medicines, drugs, and medical and surgical equipment and appliances, pharmaceutical raw materials, medicinal herbs and crude drugs, X-ray films, artificial limbs and hearing aids and parts thereof, raw materials imported by manufacturers of fertilizers and pesticides, raw materials imported by the vegetable, ghee, and edible oil industry, crude oil and petroleum products, newsprint, vegetable seeds, onions, tea, books, magazines, journals and periodicals, secondhand clothing, raw ju te, ju te bags, cement, items on the tied list, imports under barter, pulses, raw materials against import licenses issued under the Export Performance (RMR) Scheme, and motorcycles and motor scooters and auto-rickshaws (completely knocked-down condition) imported by firms which have been given sanction for "progressive" manufacture under the deletion program, potatoes, and all live animals other than swine.

The remittance of dividends declared out of current profits is allowed freely to foreign shareholders where the investment was made with the Government's ap- proval. With the approval of the State Bank, profits of branches of foreign companies may be remitted to their head offices. The same applies to head office expenses charged to a branch's profit and loss account and accepted for tax purposes by the Pakistani income tax authorities. Authorized dealers may sell foreign ex- change up to US$1,000 a person every two years for private travel, irrespective of the number of days spent abroad;6 this allocation can be used in installments. In addition to this quota each traveler is allowed US$50 a trip. Additional exchange for business travel, medical treatment, education, and sponsored cultural trips may be granted on an individual basis. Student maintenance allowances for study abroad range from US$4,199 to US$6,843 depending on region. Student allowances can be drawn through authorized dealers without requiring State Bank approval. Allowances for professional train- ing abroad range from US$750 a month for junior executives to US$1,200 a month for senior executives. There are also specific allowances for pilgrims' travel to Saudi Arabia. Exporters of goods with annual export earnings in excess of PRs 2.5 million and exporters of services in excess of PRs 0.25 million are entitled to a renewable one-year blanket permission for the purchase of travel tickets and travel exchange of US$150 a day up to US$4,500 for each business trip. Foreigners leaving Pakistan within six months from the date of their arrival in Pakistan may take out foreign currency not exceeding the amounts they brought in and PRs 100 a person in Pakistan currency notes. Residents leaving for Afghanistan may take out any amount of Afghan currency. Nationals working abroad who visit Pakistan may retain for three months the foreign ex- change they brought in. When leaving Pakistan within three months from the date of arrival, they may take with them the unspent balance of foreign exchange (including foreign currency notes up to the equivalent of US$50 a person). Larger amounts of foreign currency notes can be taken out if the currency notes were declared on entry. Nationals whose stay in Pakistan exceeds three months may take out foreign exchange, including foreign cur- rency notes up to a value of US$50 a person, not exceeding US$500 a family, provided these amounts were deposited by them with an authorized dealer immediately on arrival in Pakistan. Residents traveling to other foreign destinations may take out PRs 100 a person in Pakistan currency and any amount in foreign currency notes and traveler's checks sold by authorized banks under general authority delegated to them or under permission issued by the State Bank. Foreigners may make family remittances of up to 50 percent of net income or US$750 a month, whichever is higher. 6The allowances for travel to Ind ia, Bangladesh, and A fghan i s tan are less. 383 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PAKISTAN Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of specified commodities to any destination and all exports to Israel and South Africa are pro- hibited. 7 Exports of most other commodities are allowed freely. However, certain specified exports are subject to export quotas (for example, maize, gram, camels, and split gram), quality controls (such as batteries, electric bulbs and appliances, and oil cakes), or minimum export prices (such as hand-knotted carpets up to 96 knots and certain varieties of onyx blocks). The Cotton Export Corporation (CECP) has a monopoly over exports of cotton although private exporters may act as its agents; rice is exported through the Rice Export Corporation (RECP), and cement through the State Cement Corpora- tion. Chemical fertilizers and some chemicals may be exported only by the TCP or other public sector agencies. Goods consigned to India can be exported only by public sector agencies. The State Bank requires a declaration by the exporter that payment will be received in accordance with the prescribed method and within the prescribed period of time except for goods manufactured in the export processing zones. The authorized dealer certifies the export form for shipment. Exporters are obliged to collect and surrender export proceeds within four months of shipment, although the State Bank may allow an extension of this period. Exporters may, however, with the prior approval of the State Bank, grant deferred payment terms. The surrender of Afghan currency accruing from exports to Afghanistan is not required. Export financing at concessional rates is provided for all exports, with the exception of 25 specified items8 based on irrevocable letters of credit or firm export orders on a case-by-case basis under Part I of the Export Finance Scheme,9 or, alternatively, on the basis of the previous year's export performance of the exporter as advance limit on a revolving basis under Part II of the scheme. Fiscal rebates are paid on the f.o.b. value of cotton textile exports, engineering goods, and other exports as follows: gray cloth (5 percent); finished cloth, made-up textiles containing at least 50 percent cotton by weight, acetate yarn, leather goods (including artificial leather products), hand-knotted carpets and canvas foot- wear (7.5 percent); engineering goods (including domes- tically produced engineering goods supplied locally 7 Prohibited exports include ferrous and nonferrous metals (exclud- ing iron and steel manufactured goods), edible oils, grains, dairy products, animal fats, beef, mutton, timber, certain hides and skins, pulses and beans, wet blue leather made from cowhides and calfhides, wheat bran, wheat straw, and charcoal. 8The exceptions are: raw cotton; cotton yarn; fish other than frozen and preserved; mutton and beef; petroleum products; crude vegetable material; wool and animal hair; crude animal material; feedstuff for animals; all grains including grain flour; stone, sand, and gravel; waste and scrap of all kinds; fertilizer crude; oilseeds, nuts, and kernels; pearls and precious stones; jewelry exported under the Entrustment Scheme; live animals; hides and skins; wet blue leather; inorganic elements, oxides, etc.; crude minerals; works of art and antiques; all metals; fur skins; and wood in rough or squared form. 9 Under specified conditions authorized dealers may grant conces- sional finance without State Bank approval and without an irrevocable letter of credit or firm export order. 384 against international tender), surgical instruments, sport- ing goods, cutlery, specified PVC products, repair work performed on foreign vessels in the Karachi shipyard, and glass bottles (12.5 percent). A rebate of 55 percent is available against the tax payable on income attributable to the sales proceeds from exports of goods manufactured in Pakistan. Indus- trial units established under the Pay-As-You-Earn Scheme are permitted to utilize up to 50 percent of the f.o.b. value of exports for the servicing of suppliers' credit on imports of plant and machinery. Export duties are levied on staple cotton, oil cakes, molasses, semi- tanned hides and skins, crushed bones, and onyx blocks. Proceeds from Invisibles With the exception of Afghan currency, which may be retained, incoming foreign exchange derived from invis- ibles must be surrendered within three months. Travelers may bring in PRs 100 in Pakistan currency notes a person and Rs 5 in coin that is legal tender in India. There is no limitation on the import of other currency notes and coin. Capital Investments in Pakistan by nonresidents are subject to approval. In order to encourage industrial development in Pakistan, the Government follows a liberal policy toward foreign entrepreneurs, who, with the approval of the Government, may start any industry in the private sector without conditions being laid down regarding the participation of local capital. It is expected, however, that local rupee expenditure will ordinarily be met from local equity capital. Repatriation facilities are as follows: (1) Foreign capital invested in approved industries established after September 1, 1954 may be repatriated at any time to the extent of the original investment, and current profits may be transferred without restriction to the country of origin of the capital. (2) Profits reinvested in approved indus- trial projects with the sanction of the Government may be treated as investment for the purpose of subsequent repatriation. (3) Appreciation of any capital investment under (1) and (2) may also be treated as investment for the purpose of subsequent repatriation. These repatria- tion facilities do not apply to the purchase of shares on the stock exchange, unless the purchase is an integral part of an approved investment project, or to capital invested in Pakistan before September 1, 1954. Guaran- tees provide for just and fair compensation in the currency of the country of origin of the investment in the event of nationalization of any project. Foreign nationals in Pakistan or abroad may register their investments in National Prize Bonds issued by the Government of Pakistan; the principal in such transac- tions can be repatriated at any time, but the prize funds are treated as savings for the purpose of exchange control regulations on outward transfers. Transfers of capital abroad by resident nationals are, in general, not permitted; the purchase of foreign ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution securities by Pakistani residents requires approval by the State Bank. Detailed rules govern the transfer of capital by persons emigrating or retiring from Pakistan, depend- ing upon the nationality of the person concerned and the country to which the transfer is to be made. Foreign nationals temporarily residing in Pakistan are treated as nonresidents for purposes of transfer of securities. General permission has been given in connection with the issue, sale, or transfer of Pakistan securities, exclud- ing shares of public or private limited companies, in favor of nonresidents, provided that the securities are registered at the address in Pakistan of the purchaser and investment is made on the basis of nonrepatriation of capital and return. Pakistan securities held by nonresi- dents may be transferred to other nonresidents against payment abroad, subject to the same terms and condi- tions as those applicable to the transferor. A general permission has also been issued allowing foreign nation- als temporarily resident in Pakistan to make investments in units of the National Investment Trust, subject to certain stipulations. Exports of securities are subject to approval. Proceeds accruing from the liquidation of nonresident capital assets that are not covered by repatriation arrangements must be credited to blocked accounts. Subject to ap- proval by the State Bank, balances on blocked accounts may be invested in approved government securities payable in Pakistan rupees or placed as time deposits with banks. A general permission allows Pakistani nationals resi- dent abroad to acquire securities in Pakistan by remit- tance of foreign exchange or by debiting their nonresi- dent accounts in Pakistan; dividends or interest thereon, as well as the proceeds upon sale, may be transferred abroad, provided that these securities were held for no less than one year. Pakistani nationals require the prior approval of the State Bank to sell movable or immovable assets held abroad, and the liquidation proceeds must be repatriated to Pakistan through normal banking channels. Gold The export and import of gold are prohibited unless authorized by the State Bank. Such permission is normally not granted. However, under a special scheme, jewelry manufacturers are allowed to import gold for the purpose of manufacturing jewelry for export. Banks incorporated in Pakistan are not permitted to engage in purchases or sales of bullion whether in or outside Pakistan. Changes During 1984 Imports and Import Payments January 23.

Commercial banks quote buying and selling rates for certain other currencies based on the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar in markets abroad. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. On November 26, 1946 Panama notified the Fund that it accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control Most import and export licenses are issued by the Price Regulation Office, a semiautonomous institution of the Panamanian Government. The Price Regulation Office is responsible for the implementation of restric- tions on imports of commodities that compete with national production and on certain exports. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry determines the import quotas for commodities listed in trade agreements, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, jointly with the Price Regulation Office, those for certain agricultural commodities. Prescription of Currency There are no prescription of currency requirements. Imports and Import Payments Quotas are imposed on imports of certain commodities competing with present or prospective domestic produc- tion; some of these are not being licensed. Import licensing also applies to imports of various foodstuffs. Other imports are free. Imports by the public sector, however, are subject to special requirements. Payments abroad may be made freely. In addition to import duty, a tax of 7.5 percent of the f .o .b. value is levied on private sector imports of all dutiable goods other than specified pharmaceutical prod- ucts and foodstuffs, for which the rate is 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively; books are exempt. Most imports are also subject to a tax of 5 percent calculated on the sum of the c . i . f. value and all other import taxes and charges; among the exemptions are fuels, lubricants, and related products, as well as foodstuffs, specified medicinal and pharmaceutical products, and imports into the Free Zone. Exports and Export Proceeds Export taxes are levied on gold, silver, platinum, manganese, and other minerals, sugar, bananas, coco- nuts, scrap metals, pearls, animal wax, nispero gum, ipecac root, and rubber. Exports of certain foodstuffs, firearms, and ammunition are prohibited. Certain non- traditional exports are eligible for tax credit certificates. The proceeds of exports are not subject to exchange control. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments for and proceeds from invisibles are not restricted. A travel tax of 4 percent is levied on air and sea tickets bought in Panama or on such tickets pur- chased for travelers starting their trip in Panama. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or payments by residents or nonresidents. Several foreign-controlled banks are authorized to con- duct business only with nonresidents. Gold Panama has issued two commemorative gold coins with face values of B 100 and B 500, which are legal tender but do not circulate. Residents may freely hold gold in any form at home or abroad and may freely negotiate gold in any form with residents or nonresidents at home and abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry carried as personal effects by travelers are subject to license if made by residents other than the monetary authorities; import licenses are issued freely by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and export licenses are granted by the Ministry of Finance and Treasury. Exports of unworked gold produced in Panama are subject to an export duty of 1 percent ad valorem, and exports of gold coin (other than U .S. coins, which are exempt) are subject to a du ty of 0.5 per- cent.

Not for Redistribution PAPUA NEW GUINEA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Papua New Guinea is the Papua New Guinea Kina. The exchange rate of the kina in terms of the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, is adjusted daily on the basis of its relationship to a weighted basket of currencies representing Papua New Guinea's major trading partners. On December 30, 1984 the official buying and selling rates quoted by the Bank of Papua New Guinea for the U .S. dollar were US$1.0607 and US$1.0591, respectively, per K 1. The commercial banks, the only authorized foreign exchange dealers, publish rates for all current transactions with their customers, within a maximum spread of 2 percent between buying and selling. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Papua New Guinea formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from December 4, 1975. Administration of Control Foreign exchange control is administered by the Bank of Papua New Guinea under the Central Banking (Foreign Exchange and Gold) Regulations, Chapter 138. Overall policy is determined by the Government with the advice of the Bank of Papua New Guinea and the Ministry of Finance. The Bank of Papua New Guinea has delegated considerable powers to the commercial banks operating in Papua New Guinea, which have been appointed authorized dealers in foreign exchange and gold. Export licensing is administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Prescription of Currency Contractual commitments, which are expressed in a foreign currency, to persons resident outside Papua New Guinea must be met by payments in foreign currency.1 Export proceeds may be received in any foreign currency or in k ina from an overseas bank's account in Papua New Guinea. Nonresident Accounts The Bank of Papua New Guinea controls all credits to nonresident bank accounts; funds credited to such ac- counts may be w i thdrawn without further formality. Only in exceptional circumstances is approval given for a nonresident bank account to be denominated in a foreign currency. Imports and Import Payments Imports of a limited number of goods are restricted for health, security, and protective reasons. Certain import items are subject to quotas for reasons of domestic 1 Foreign currencies are defined as all currencies other than the k ina. protection; quotas are adjusted quarterly, reflecting the extent to which local production can meet domestic demand. There are no import licensing requirements. Autho- rized dealers have powers to approve most transactions without referring to the Bank of Papua New Guinea. Normally import payments should be settled within 90 days of the arrival of the goods in the country; approval for payment on extended credit terms is usually given for items such as capital goods. Payments for Invisibles Approval is readily given for most payments for invisibles, provided that supporting documentation can be produced. The remittance overseas of life insurance premiums on new policies written after December 31, 1975 in the names of permanent residents is not permitted. Applications for foreign exchange for foreign travel in excess of the equivalent of K 4,000 an adult and K 1,500 a minor a year for tourist travel and K 2,000 for each business trip are referred to the Bank of Papua New Guinea for consideration. Travelers may not take or send out of Papua New Guinea domestic currency in excess of K 200 in notes and K 5 in coin; however, domestic coins issued for numismatic purposes may be taken out freely. Overseas visitors are free to take out any currency which they had brought in and recorded on arrival. Exports and Export Proceeds Residents of Papua New Guinea may export goods w i thout exchange control formality on condition that they comply with the terms of the general authority issued by the Bank of Papua New Guinea. The essential conditions of this authority are that payment for goods exported is received within six months of the date of export and that the proceeds are sold to an authorized dealer in Papua New Guinea. When exporters are not in a position to comply with the conditions of the general authority, they must apply to the Bank for a specific authority. No authority is needed for certain categories of goods, including sundry items such as passengers' personal effects. Export licenses are required for all types of goods under the Exports (Control and Valua- tion) Act. Special provisions are in force for the export of prescribed goods (logs, pearls, tuna f ish, and wood chips). Specified commodities are subject to export levies. Proceeds from Invisibles Approval is required only for the disposal of foreign currency proceeds other than by sale to an authorized dealer in Papua New Guinea. Overseas visitors may bring in any amount of currency for travel expenditure. 389 ©International Monetary Fund.

New invest- ment outside Papua New Guinea by permanent residents and by companies and other organizations operating in Papua New Guinea is subject to certain limitations. When an investment is for portfolio reasons, the amount wh ich may be invested in a 12-month period is limited to K 10,000 a person. Investment may only be in the form of marketable company securities and real estate. The approval of the Bank of Papua New Guinea is needed for the acquisition and disposal of foreign securities by permanent residents.2 Persons who have been declared to be temporary residents by an authorized dealer or the Bank of Papua New Guinea may repatriate their surplus earnings without l im i t. Prior clearance from the tax authorities may be required for these transactions. Approval by the Bank of Papua New Guinea is required for all new or increased foreign investment in 2 Foreign securities are defined in the Central Bank ing Act as in c lud ing deposits in overseas bank accounts and debts due by persons outside Papua New Gu inea. Papua New Guinea. In most cases the Bank of Papua New Guinea refers such applications to the Ministry of Finance. Foreign investments other than those in bank- ing and insurance are also subject to approval by the National Investment and Development Authority. Ap- proval from the Bank of Papua New Guinea is also necessary for the acknowledgment of indebtedness so that a right to receive a payment is conferred on a nonresident. Offshore borrowing by private sector entities in Papua New Guinea may not exceed the debt/ equity ratio of 3:1. Commercial banks may undertake offshore borrowing for on-lending to exporters, provided that no assumption of exchange risk is involved. Gold Under the Central Banking (Foreign Exchange and Gold) Regulations, Chapter 138, approval by the Bank of Papua New Guinea is necessary for the sale, purchase, export, and import of gold.

Not for Redistribution PARAGUAY (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Paraguay is the Paraguayan Guaram. The exchange market consists of three different ex- change rates of which two are fixed by the Central Bank, and the third, operated by commercial banks and exchange houses, fluctuates freely. An exchange rate of 0 160 per US$1 applies to transactions with the binational entities (involved in the construction of the hydroelectric power plants Itaipu and Yacyreta), official capital transactions, and public sector external debt- service payments. The major part of export receipts, private capital transfers, government imports, and im- ports of petroleum, fue l, agricultural, and industrial inputs are settled at a rate of 0 240 per US$1 .l All other transactions (i.e., most import payments, profit remit- tances, and private service payments) are channeled through the free exchange market; in December 1984, the rate prevailing in this market was around 0 400 per US$1. A tax of P/2 percent is levied on purchases and sales of foreign exchange in the official market, with the excep- tion of transactions with foreign embassies and diplo- mats, meat packing plants, and those relating to invest- ments in Paraguay under the terms of Investment Law No. 550/75. A fee of 2 percent is levied on sales of foreign exchange for imports. In addition, banks charge a commission of 2 percent on all sales of foreign exchange. Additional selling rates result from the application of an 8 percent tax on the c . i . f. value of a wide range of consumer goods imported from nonmember countries of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA), a 10 percent tax on outward remittances of profits and dividends, and a 30 percent tax on outward remittances of interest, royalties, rent, honoraria, commissions, and other income accruing to nonresidents from Paraguayan sources. For interest payments on foreign loans con- tracted by national banks, the tax is applied only to the spread if floating rate loans are involved, and only to 6l/z percent of interest on fixed-rate loans. There are no forward exchange facilities. The authorized banks are required to transfer all of their daily gross foreign exchange receipts in the official market to the Central Bank. The Central Bank charges the authorized banks a commission of 1 percent on its sales of foreign exchange at the official exchange rate. Authorized banks are required to report their daily transactions to the Central Bank. Administration of Control The Central Bank determines foreign exchange policy and supervises, together with the Superintendency of 1 In May 1984 an official rate of 0 160 per US$1 was introduced for petroleum and fuel imports; in practice, such imports have been settled at a rate of <p 240 per US$1.

Clearing takes place every four months, but Paraguay, as a relatively less developed country, may request special settlement every two months. There are no other prescription of currency requirements. Imports and Import Payments Imports of certain commodities require authoriza- t ion .2 Imports of wheat and wheat flour are made by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The Central Bank operates a register of importers, consisting of four categories of priority for import goods. All imports are subject to a minimum financing term of 120 days. The Central Bank has introduced provisional measures lim- iting access to the purchase of foreign exchange at official rates to essential imports. In addition, commer- cial banks have been instructed not to open letters of credit for importers unless the latter already have, from their own resources, the foreign exchange necessary to settle the external obligations. Imports of a few com- modities are prohibited.3 An exchange tax (recargo de cambio) of 8 percent is levied on the c . i . f. value of goods covered by Decree Law No. 27018 when imported from non-LAIA coun- tries. Surcharges, calculated on the c . i . f. value, are payable on most imports even if no foreign exchange payment takes place. An import surcharge of 36 percent applies to most general imports from any source; however, for goods originating in LAIA countries and included in the Paraguayan National List, the rate ranges from 3 percent to 30 percent. For certain other goods from LAIA member countries (mainly Pharmaceuticals on a special list), the rate is 8 percent. Fuel derived from petroleum is subject to a surcharge of 15 percent (10 per- cent if from neighboring countries and Uruguay). There is an additional surcharge of 5 percent on imports from all sources of telephone and telegraph equ ipmen t, televi- sion receivers, radios, and record players, and their parts and accessories. Surcharges are collected by the banks at the time of delivery of the documents for customs clearance or when the import payment is made, 2These inc lude table w ine in b u l k, na tu ral grape must concentrate, rice in the husk or w i th any degree of processing, gasoline, diesel o i l, gas oil, kerosene, wire, na i ls, dry cell batteries, and potatoes, garlic, and onions during local harvest seasons. 3 These inc lude certain tex t i les and con t inuous (paper) forms for use in cash registers and computers. 391 ©International Monetary Fund.

The following are the principal imports exempted from the surcharge: wheat, cement, crude petroleum, equipment for petroleum exploration and exploitation, agricultural tractors, imports for the Government, imports for religious, charitable, cultural, or educational purposes, and imports by foreign diplo- mats and certain international organizations. Also ex- empted are agricultural and industrial machinery and equipment imported through the Spanish free zone in Paraguay, agricultural machinery and equipment for the National Wheat Program, books and periodicals, and im- ports for investments under Investment Law No. 550/75. Imports of investment goods and of raw materials for export industries receive exemption on a case-by-case basis. In addition to the above surcharges, a tariff surcharge is levied on certain imports. The rate of surcharge is generally 12 percent to 24 percent (8 percent to 16 per- cent for certain goods subject to LAIA concessions) and the surcharge is levied on the c . i . f. value, calculated as the f .o .b. value plus 10 percent for imports from neighboring countries and Uruguay, or the f .o .b. value plus 20 percent for imports from other countries. Exempt from this additional import duty are public sector and diplomatic imports, raw materials and equipment for the production of goods that are subject to internal consump- tion taxes, imports under the Investment Law, and all imported goods taxed under the Internal Consumption Tax Law. Imports are also subject to a sales tax ranging from 5 percent to 10 percent, and certain imports are subject to a 15 percent ad valorem levy. There is also a 1 percent tax on general imports and an import duty at rates of 5 percent, 8 percent, and 12 percent for interme- diate goods and raw materials for industry. Imports of specified goods (including television sets and precious metals) may not be financed with foreign credit. Imports on credit for a term of more than six months require approval from the Central Bank. This approval is normally granted only for imports of machi- nery and other capital goods. Import payments must be made through banks, at the official rates of exchange, or at the rate prevailing in the parallel market. For certain commodities originating in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and Uruguay, and falling under the regional trade regime, import payments need not be channeled through banks. As long as proof of payment of the preferential tariff rates for these imports can be presented, payment may be effected with the importer's own foreign exchange. Payments for Invisibles Payments for current invisibles are settled at the free market rate, with the exception of government transac- tions, which are settled at 0 240 per US$1. Travelers may take out any amount in foreign or domestic currency. There is an ad valorem sales tax of 5 percent on international airline tickets. 392 Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of logs and rough beams and some other unprocessed forest products are prohibited, as are ex- ports of rawhides and cement. Beef exports are subject to annual export quotas, and certain other exports require prior authorization in order to ensure adequate supplies for domestic consumption and to meet the needs of domestic industries. All other exports are free from licensing requirements, but some require a certificate issued by the Institute of Technology and Standards, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, or the Ministry of Agriculture and Stock Raising. The proceeds of exports must be collected within 120 days after completion of the banking formalities related to the shipping documents. The foreign exchange must be converted at banks authorized to deal in exchange; and the proceeds must be surrendered at the exchange rate for each type of commodity. For all exports, the Central Bank establishes m in imum export prices denom- inated in U .S. dollars. Exporters are required to surren- der, in the official exchange market, all the foreign exchange proceeds from their exports which may not be less than the amount corresponding to the m in imum price set by the Central Bank. Advance receipts of export proceeds must also be sold to authorized banks. Export taxation is based on a list of assumed export values (aforos) published by the Ministry of Finance. Most exports are subject to taxes, payable in guaranis, ranging from l!/2 percent to 7!/2 percent of the f .o .b value. Certain exports are subject to an additional tax of l!/2 percent. Exports of expellers, soybean flour, and meat products are exempt from export taxes. Proceeds from Invisibles Except for foreign exchange inflows from the bina- tional entities (which have to be transferred in fu ll to the Central Bank), there are no surrender requirements for proceeds from invisibles. Travelers may bring in any amount in foreign or domestic currency. Capital All inward and outward transfers must be channeled through the authorized banks or exchange houses. Banks may provide foreign exchange at the rate of 0 240 per US$1 for transfers of registered capital, subject to presentation of appropriate documentation. In June 1983, the Central Bank introduced provisional measures which included the limiting of annual sales of foreign exchange for the amortization of private sector debt to no more than 10 percent of the originally registered external liability. In addition, firms (including commercial banks) were prohibited, except when a substantial hard- ship could be shown, from repatriating retained earn- ings. Under Investment Law No. 550/75, the Govern- ment is empowered to grant special tax, customs import surcharge, and advance deposit concessions to proposed investments, provided that these are du ly registered and approved.

The following modifications were made in the exchange rate system: (a) the exchange rate for all exports was set at 0 240 per US$1; (b) all foreign exchange from exports was required to be transferred daily to the Central Bank; (c) all foreign exchange corresponding to private capital movements, services, and income from other sources would be converted at the rate of 0 240 per US$1 and would be transferred daily to the Central Bank; (d) all imports by the Government and autonomous institutions included in the budget would be settled at a rate of 0 240 per US$1; (e) imports of agricultural and industrial inputs utilized in the process- ing of domestic raw materials would be settled at the rate of 0 240 per US$1; (f) imports of petroleum and fuels would be settled at the rate of 0 160 per US$1; (g) settle- ment for all other imports would be effected with foreign exchange from the parallel market; (h) settlement for all services (freight, insurance, commissions, travel, etc.) would be made with foreign exchange from the parallel market; (i) foreign exchange inflows from the binational entities (Itaipu and Yacyreta) would be converted at the rate of 0 160 per US$1 and transferred in fu ll to the Central Bank; (j) amortization and interest payments on public foreign debt would be made at the rate of 0 160 per US$1; (k) all public sector borrowing would be converted at the rate of 0 160 per US$1; (1) all capital and interest remittances on foreign loans negotiated by the commercial banks and the private sector, and utilized for the production of goods, would be settled at a rate of 0 240 per US$1; (m) remittances of profits and divi- dends from private capital would be settled with foreign exchange from the parallel market; (n) import payments arrears in respect of which local currency had been paid by the importers to the commercial banks, deposited in the Central Bank and verified by the Exchange Commis- sion, would be liquidated at a rate of 0 160 per US$1; and (o) commercial banks were authorized to operate in the fluctuating free market and were required to give PERU (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Peru is the Peruvian Sol. The exchange rate for the sol is established by the Central Reserve Bank in relation to the U .S. dollar, the interven- tion currency, and is adjusted frequently on the basis of a set of indicators. Exchange market transactions may also be conducted in 14 other currencies, on the basis of their exchange rates in terms of the U .S. dollar in the international marke t .l All exchange transactions must be conducted through the banking system or recognized exchange dealers. An exchange tax of 1 percent is levied on foreign exchange proceeds from exports of goods and services, issuance and renewal of U .S. dollar certificates of deposit, and on purchases of foreign exchange for imports of goods and services. All exchange transactions are conducted on the basis of two rates: the rate set daily by the Central Reserve Bank (CRB rate, with a commis- sion of up to 0.5 percent on the selling side) and the rate for bank certificates of deposit (CD rate), which fluc- tuates freely in response to supply and demand. All government transactions and most current private trans- actions are conducted at the CRB rate. Under existing contracts, the unified exchange market selling rate (identical to the CRB rate since April 1982) continues to be used for remittances of petroleum companies, while the CRB rate of the preceding business day is applied in the conversion process of unused and expired ten-day exchange certificates. Banks and dealers operating in the unified exchange market are required to limit the spread between their buying and selling rates on any given day to not more than 0.5 percent (excluding the spread arising from the 1 percent exchange tax). On Decem- ber 31, 1984 the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were S/. 5,681.77 and S/. 5,710.18, respec- tively, per US$1. Banks and nonbank financial institutions may open foreign exchange demand and time deposit accounts for residents and nonresidents. In addition, banks may issue certificates of deposit denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign currency certificates of deposit must be for amounts of not less than US$1,000 and have a maturity of not longer than 360 days. They are freely negotiable both in Peru and abroad and may be used by the holder for making all permitted payments and transfers, includ- ing import payments. Certain types of transactions, including purchases of foreign exchange for tourism and business travel abroad, for educational and personal remittances, and for settlement among residents of contracts denominated in foreign exchange, are required 'Be lg ian francs, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, and Swiss francs, together with U .S. dollars, are prescribed for external trade transactions.

Transactions in foreign currency certificates take place at a fluctuating premium over the official buy ing and selling rates; in 1984, the differential averaged 7.18 percent. Residents are free to hold abroad their foreign ex- change receipts other than those from exports. If repatri- ated, such exchange may be sold to the banking system, or be deposited in foreign currency accounts, or be used to purchase foreign currency certificates of deposit. Export proceeds, including loans for the prefinancing of exports, other than nontraditional exports benefiting from subsidized credit, must be surrendered to the Central Reserve Bank, which issues ten-day exchange certificates for the fu ll value of receipts from traditional exports and for 85 percent of receipts in the case of nontraditional exports. These exchange certificates are held by the surrendering bank (or any other bank to which they may be subsequently assigned) for use by the exporter for his own permitted foreign exchange pay- ments and transfers or for conversion into soles at the CRB rate of the day. If not so utilized within their maturity, the certificates are canceled, and the corre- sponding amount in soles is credited to the account of the bank at the buy ing rate in effect at the close of the preceding business day, minus a discount of 2 percent. Exporters of nontraditional products availing them- selves of subsidized credit from the Fund for Nontradi- tional Exports (PENT) are eligible for 180-day nontrans- ferable exchange certificates (PENT certificates) against the surrender of foreign exchange proceeds of preship- ment and postshipment credits received from abroad, provided that such foreign credits do not exceed 72 percent of the contemplated export value. Extensions of up to 360 days in the validity period of the certificates are permitted. PENT certificates remain in the custody of the Central Reserve Bank and bear interest at the LIB OR plus five percentage points for the duration of the foreign export financing; they are applied directly by the Central Reserve Bank for the cancellation of part of the PENT credit to the exporter in local currency. Upon surrender of export proceeds, the Central Reserve Bank issues a second set of exchange certificates for the direct cancel- lation of the PENT credit not covered by PENT certificates. For the remainder of the surrendered foreign exchange, the following procedure is followed: for up to 15 percent of the total export proceeds, freely disposable ten-day exchange certificates are issued to the exporter; for any remaining exchange surrendered, ten-day ex- change certificates are issued that are usable either for payments through the unified exchange market or for conversion into soles at the CRB exchange rate. Peru formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement as from February 15, 1961. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Administration of Control Export and import licenses are issued by the General Directorate of Foreign Trade in the Ministry of Econ- omy, Finance, and Commerce, and can be easily obtained for most products. The Central Reserve Bank issues foreign exchange certificates against receipts from exports, and authorizes, directly or by delegation, payments for many types of invisibles. The Import Supervision Commission is the ultimate administrative authority on applications for prior import licenses denied at a lower level and rules on the exclusion of importers from the National Register of Importers. It also exercises general surveillance over the flow of imports and their effects on domestic production and is empowered to make recommendations to the Import Valuation Com- mission. The latter commission exercises surveillance over customs valuation and has the authority to purchase and auction off, or to impose special duties on, those imports deemed to be undervalued or dumped. Public sector imports valued at more than US$10,000 require the approval of the Board for External Transactions of the Public Sector and must be registered with the General Directorate of Foreign Trade. Public sector imports valued at more than US$50,000 require, in addition, a resolution of the Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Commerce. Borrowing abroad by the public sector, as well as borrowing abroad by the private sector with a govern- ment guarantee, is subject to prior approval by Supreme Decree, on the recommendation of the Committee of the External Debt and the National Planning Institute. Public enterprises are required to register their short-term indebtedness with the General Directorate of Public Credit (GDPC) and to obtain GDPC's approval for renewal, rollover, or consolidation of such debt. Moreover, with effect from January 1983, the enterprises must submit their annual short-term borrowing programs to GDPC for approval. The National Commission on Investment and Foreign Technology (CONITE) supervises foreign direct investment in Peru, and the use of foreign trademarks, patents, and licenses, as well as the related royalty payments. Most payments for invisibles require the approval of either CONITE or the Central Reserve Bank. Prescription of Currency All exchange market operations must be effected in one of the 15 prescribed convertible currencies, but exchange certificates may be issued by the Central Reserve Bank only in U.S. dollars. Payments between Peru and Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela must be made through accounts maintained with each other by the Central Reserve Bank of Peru and the other central banks concerned, within the framework of the multilateral clearing system of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA). PERU Imports and Import Payments Import prohibitions apply to 179 commodities out of the approximately 5,300 eight-digit items of the Peru- vian customs nomenclature (NABAND INA ). These com- modities include agricultural products, footwear, tex- tiles, and security-related materials. Another set of 124 items specified by the General Directorate of Foreign Trade is importable only subject to prior approval (observation) from the appropriate ministry; they in- clude items subject to public sector monopoly or deemed in need of protection or damaging to public welfare. All other items may be imported without quantitative restric- tion but importers must be listed in the National Register of Importers. However, imports valued at up to US$2,000 a year are free from licensing or registration requirements. An import license for imports from countries of the Andean Pact is not required nor is the listing of the importer in the National Register of Importers; the imports need only be registered with the General Directorate of Foreign Trade. Imports of raw materials and intermediate goods for the production of nontradi- tional exports are exempted from import duties and a specific import license is not required, provided that the appropriate ministry determines that such imports qual- ify under the Temporary Admission Regime. Certain industrial raw materials and fertilizers, as well as certain agricultural commodities, such as milk pow- der, may be imported only by the National Enterprise for Industrial Marketing (ENCl), and crude petroleum and petroleum derivatives only by PETROPERU, a government agency. Imports of capital goods must be covered by irrevoca- ble documentary credits, and the intermediating bank must guarantee refunding of the foreign currency if the import is not effected by the time the relevant documen- tary credit expires. There are no m in imum financing requirements for imports, and advance payments are permitted except for capital goods imported by firms with an annual turnover in excess of S/. 10 billion. With specified exemptions, imported goods are sub- ject to a uniform value-added tax of 8 percent2 of the c . i . f. value of imports (in addition to the import duty); exemptions from the value-added tax include agricultural products, certain minerals and fue ls, medicines, fertiliz- ers, pesticides, agricultural equipment and tractors, aviation equipment and ships in excess of 1,000 tons, and items for personal use (including automobiles up to 2,000 cubic centimeters). In addition, a selective con- sumption tax (also in addition to the import du ty) is levied on luxury items, ranging from 10 percent to 40 percent of the c . i . f. value. Under the 1980 customs tariff, as amended, the max imum import du ty is 91 percent ad valorem, and the unweighted average rate at the end of 1984 amounted to 42 percent.3 In addition, 2 On January 1, 1985, the value-added tax rate of 11 percent came into effect. 3Inc lud ing the 15 percent surcharge. 395 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PERU many imports are subject to one or both of the following taxes: (1) an additional import tax for the promotion of nontraditional exports of 1 percent of the c . i . f. value, and (2) a maritime freight tax of 10 percent of the ocean freight charges. However, certain goods originating in Andean Pact countries may be imported duty free. Public sector imports must, in principle, be shipped in Peruvian vessels. Payments for Invisibles Authorization of the Central Reserve Bank or other agencies is required for payments for invisibles, but the sale of foreign exchange is generally authorized freely, provided current payments permitted to be effected through the unified exchange market are involved.4 All other payments for invisibles (including most types of foreign travel) must be made through the certificate market. Remittance of net profits, including depletion and depreciation allowances, requires approval of CONITE and a prior tax clearance. In accordance with Andean Pact rules, the remittance of profits on foreign capital invested in Peru is, in principle, limited to 20 percent a year, although a higher percentage may be permitted for investments that generate employment, are in unde- veloped areas, or help to diversify exports.5 All pay- ments for royalties, patents, trademarks, and licenses require the prior approval of CONITE. Foreign-owned enterprises may not enter into new contracts to pay royalties to a foreign parent company or its affiliates. The effective interest rate on a new loan from a foreign parent company or its affiliate may not exceed by more than 3 percent the prevailing interest rate for first-class assets in the money market of the country in whose currency the transaction is conducted. Approval by the Central Reserve Bank is required for purchases of foreign exchange for payments of interest on certain loans, for certain insurance payments and pension remittances to nonresidents, and for expenditures of agencies, branches, and offices of nonresident firms. Interest payments by public sector entities require the approval of the General Directorate of Public Credit. Indicative limits on foreign exchange sales are estab- lished for medical treatment abroad. The Central Re- serve Bank may authorize purchases of exchange in excess of the specified limits in justified cases. Nonresi- dents visiting Peru for purposes of tourism or business may, upon leaving the country, purchase up to US$500 in foreign exchange on presentation of evidence that at least that amount in foreign exchange has been converted into soles in the preceding 30 days. 4 Such payments and transfers include those for medical treatment abroad, du ly authorized off ic ial travel, registration of patents and trademarks, certain advertisement costs, banking services, profits from registered investments, income of nonresidents, pension or insurance contracts, and certain technical services. 5 Companies exporting at least 80 percent of their production to countries outside the Andean Pact and m in ing companies are exempt. 396 Exports and Export Proceeds Export prohibitions apply to 64 items, mainly rare w i ld l ife or plants. Export licenses are required in 45 other cases. The Banco Minero del Peru is the principal exporter of uncut precious stones and pearls, and MINPECO has a monopoly over exports of silver and other refined metals produced by the public enterprises, while the Banco Minero has a monopoly over exports of gold. Among other exports, monopolies are held by PESCAP- ERU, over exports of fish meal and fish oil; PETROPERU, over exports of petroleum derivatives; and ENCI, over exports of cotton. These monopolies are a traditional arrangement, and the private sector is free to establish marketing links with foreign buyers of these products. Exports of certain commodities specified by the General Directorate of Foreign Trade are subject to prior license, and all export proceeds, as well as export prefinancing loans, must be surrendered to the Central Reserve Bank within ten working days of receipt. Traditional exports must be sold against an irrevocable letter of credit confirmed by a bank established in Peru. In special cases, and with the authorization of the Central Reserve Bank and the General Directorate of Foreign Trade, exports may be sold against sight drafts, provided that payment is received within 180 days of shipment. Exporters of most nontraditional products are granted transferable tax credit certificates (certificados de rein- tegro tributario, or CERTEX) equivalent to a max imum of 25 percent of the f .o .b. value. In addition, 10 percent is allowed for exports from outside the Lima-Callao area. Exports of local handicrafts recognized as such by the General Directorate of Foreign Trade are eligible for CERTEX benefits at a rate of 30 percent. Exporters may be eligible for additional benefits at a rate of 10 percent in certain cases. CERTEX certificates may be used by the exporter in payment of his tax obligations or may be sold to other taxpayers, who may use them for the same purpose. The Banco de la Nacion administers an export credit guarantee program, and the Industrial Bank provides or arranges export finance for nontraditional exports. To be eligible for the incentives granted for nontraditional exports, exporters must be listed in the Register of Enterprises Exporting Nontraditional Prod- ucts; each entry in the list is valid for two years. Most traditional exports are subject to a tax of 5 or 10 percent, which is payable in soles, but when the international price is below a specified level, exports of copper, lead, zinc, silver, gold, t in, and tungsten are exempt. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles may be held abroad or sold to the banking system or deposited in authorized foreign exchange accounts within ten working days of receipt. Capital Outward capital transfers require approval. For trans- fers derived from foreign direct investment the approval of CONITE is required, while for most other transfers the ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution appropriate agency is the Central Reserve Bank. M in imum maturities and grace periods for different categories of external loans contracted or guaranteed by the public sector have been established. Furthermore, annual global limits are established on the contracting of new public or publicly guaranteed external debt (with certain exceptions) having an original maturity of more than one but less than ten years. Loan amortization payments of the private sector are authorized by the Central Reserve Bank and those of the public sector by the General Directorate of Public Credit. In cases where proceeds of foreign loans have been used to purchase foreign currency bank certificates of deposit or to make deposits directly to foreign currency accounts, amortiza- tion payments on such loans are not eligible for transfer at the official exchange rate. All nontrade-related short-term debts disbursed and outstanding on March 7, 1983 and falling due before March 6, 1984 are required to be refinanced on maturity for an additional period of 360 days; short-term trade credits with banks that have not signed a refinancing agreement are to be rolled over on maturity for an additional period of 90 days. Local currency funds for the servicing of these debts are to be placed on deposit in special accounts at the Central Reserve Bank on the maturity date of the original obligation. With the permission of the Central Bank, funds in these special accounts may be lent out domestically as loans denomi- nated in foreign currency, with a maturity of less than one year. Debt repayments on the short-term foreign trade credits are permitted only to those banks that have signed a refinancing agreement undertaking to maintain potential access of Peruvian borrowers to short-term lines of credit at the level outstanding on March 7, 1983. Banks may receive funds originating abroad in the form of drafts, checks, bank transfers, foreign currency traveler's checks, or foreign notes and coin for deposit to foreign currency accounts maintained in the name of residents or nonresidents. They may also issue foreign exchange certificates of deposit against such funds. These funds and the accrued interest thereon may be freely disposed of by the depositor. Under an exchange amnesty, residents may repatriate foreign assets without specifying the origin of such funds and without facing penalties for having violated exchange laws in effect prior to October 7, 1977. In compliance with the foreign investment regime approved by the countries of the Andean Pact, new foreign investments must be authorized and registered with the appropriate agency, in most instances CONITE, so that such investments are directed to projects consid- ered essential for the country's development. If a foreign company incorporated in Peru as of July 1, 1971 wishes to benefit from the duty-free program of the Cartagena Agreement, it was required to have agreed by June 30, 1974 to the gradual acquisition by national investors of shares in the company so as to transform it into a mixed or national company during a maximum period of 15 years following the entering into effect of this regime. PERU For this purpose, mixed companies are defined as those in wh ich national investors hold between 51 percent and 80 percent of the capital, while national companies are those in which at least 80 percent of the capital is owned by national investors. Since June 30, 1974 the required participation of national investors in the capital of an enterprise has been not less than 15 percent; this participation must be raised to at least 45 percent after 10 years and to at least 51 percent at the end of the 15-year period. For foreign companies established in Peru after June 30, 1971, the 15 percent participation by national investors must be secured at the time of the initiation of production. Foreign investments in firms engaged in basic industries or in mining activities (including petro- leum production) and in firms that export at least 80 percent of their production to countries outside the Andean Common Market are exempt from the require- ment of gradual transformation into mixed companies; however, these enterprises do not benefit from the duty- free program of the Cartagena Agreement. Foreign enterprises may not have access to domestic credit on terms longer than three years or in amounts greater than their capital and reserves. Investment in the mining sector is governed by the General Mining Law. Companies holding mining con- cessions may enter into mining contracts w i th the Government providing for special incentives and guaran- tees or may constitute mixed enterprises w i th govern- ment participation of at least 25 percent. The Govern- ment may grant to mining concessionaries ( in i t ia t ing large-scale investment programs) tax incentives and guaranteed availability of foreign exchange for transfers for (1) recovery of investment, (2) interest payments if the rate does not exceed the prevailing rate for similar loans in the financial market from which the loans originate, (3) payments for justified services, and (4) reasonable profit remittances, together with guaran- teed access to the most favorable exchange rate. Mixed mining enterprises may receive all the benefits and incentives which may be granted by special contract and, in addition, special tax reductions. Gold Export of gold in the form of precious metals is the monopoly of the Banco Minero del Peru. The authorities do not make foreign exchange available for imports of gold other than by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and authorized industrial and professional users. Domestic sales and purchases of gold may be carried out by industrial and professional users, provided that they hold licenses issued by the Banco Minero del Peru, but only MINPECO is authorized to make the initial purchase of newly mined gold and other precious metals.

Not for Redistribution PHILIPPINES (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Philippines is the Philippine Peso. The authorities of the Philippines do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions, and ex- change rates are determined on the basis of demand and supply in the exchange market. However, the authorities intervene when necessary in order to maintain orderly conditions in the exchange market and in light of their other policy objectives in the medium term. On Decem- ber 31, 1984 the official rate was P 19.76 per US$1. The spot buying and selling margins are determined on a competitive basis for all transactions under the general jurisdiction of the Bankers' Association of the Philip- pines. The Central Bank is not governed by the trading rules of the Bankers' Association of the Philippines in making its own purchases and sales of foreign exchange. Interbank trading takes place at the Foreign Exchange Trading Center (FOREX), through telephone communica- tions between banks during business hours. The Central Bank from time to time acts as a buyer or as a supplier on the trading floor. There is a 1 percent tax on all purchases and sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Exchange regulations are administered by the Central Bank on the basis of policy decisions reached by the Monetary Board. Certain new foreign direct or portfolio investments in the Philippines require the prior approval of the Board of Investments (BOI). In addition to other banks, the thrift banks and the rural banks are authorized by the Central Bank to deal in foreign exchange; subject to certain conditions, they may purchase foreign currencies from tourists and other specified nonresidents, for conversion into pesos. Prescription of Currency There are no prescription of currency requirements for outgoing payments, but all exchange proceeds from exports and invisibles must be obtained in prescribed currencies.! Most payments and transfers to South Africa are prohibited. Authorized agent banks and foreign exchange dealers are authorized to accept notes denominated in Saudi Arabian riyals, Kuwaiti dinars, and Bahrain dinars for conversion into pesos. Nonresident Accounts Bank accounts denominated in pesos may be opened in the names of nonresidents, whether individual or corporate, without the prior approval of the Central Bank. Nonresident accounts may be credited only with the proceeds from inward remittances of foreign ex- 1 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, deutsche mark, French francs, Hong Kong dollars, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Singapore dollars, Swiss francs, and U .S. dollars. 400 change or convertible foreign currencies and with peso income from, or peso proceeds of, conversion of properties (real or personal) located in the Philippines and belonging to nonresidents. Nonresident accounts may be freely debited for peso withdrawals. Withdraw- als from nonresident accounts for transfer abroad are subject to individual application with supporting evi- dence, and to established limits where applicable, such as in the case of emigrants. Subject to authorization, both residents and nonresi- dents may maintain foreign currency accounts with authorized agent banks in the Philippines (see section on Proceeds from Invisibles, below). Imports and Import Payments Imports from South Africa are prohibited. A priority system was in force until October 1984, under which foreign exchange for import payments was provided, in order of importance, for (a) oil imports, and (b) trade- related payments for (i) inputs into export production, (ii) raw materials for vital domestic industries, and (iii) food grains. All merchandise imports are allowed, except for certain commodities that are regulated or restricted for reasons, inter alia, of public health, national welfare, and security. Imports are at present classified into freely importable commodities, prohibited, banned, regulated, or liber- alized commodities. The first group comprises com- modities which are freely importable and which may be given due course by authorized agent banks (AABs) without prior approval of the Central Bank. Prohibited commodities are commodities whose importation is prohibited, such as those originating from South Africa, onions, potatoes, garlic, cabbages (except for seedling purposes), and coffee. The third category —i.e., banned commodities—are those for which importation requires prior central bank approval. These are further classified into nonessential consumer (NEC) and unclassified consumer (UC) goods. Regulated commodity imports are defined as commodities which require clearances and permits from various government agencies but do not need prior central bank approval before importation. Finally, liberalized commodities are commodities that were formerly banned which may now be imported without prior central bank approval. Sales of foreign exchange for imports of commodities that are classified under the two categories of consumer goods—UC and NEC—are subject to prior approval of the Central Bank and the opening of letters of credit for such imports must be reported to the Central Bank within 24 hours. Payments for imports of certain other commodities (wheat, raw cotton, and leaf tobacco) are permitted only if they are financed through certain official credit arrangements. Any importation of plant, machinery, ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution equipment, and spare parts under deferred payments arrangements with maturity periods longer than 360 days is subject to prior approval by the Central Bank. If payment terms are cash or within 360 days, prior approval by the Central Bank is necessary for importa- tion by any single importer of nonagricultural machinery and equipment with an aggregate value in excess of US$10,000 within a calendar month, with the exception of (a) imports of specified machinery and implements; and (b) plant machinery and equipment for the exchange and direct use of (i) export-oriented firms that qualify as such under central bank regulations; (ii) registered activities of BOI-registered firms; and (iii) companies registered with the Export Processing Zone Authority (EPZA), subject in all cases to the presentation of required certifications from relevant government agen- cies concerned. Trade with any of the state-trading countries, exclud- ing Yugoslavia, must be effected through the Philippine International Trading Corporation. As a method of payment, commodities may be imported against letters of credit, on a document against acceptance (D/A) basis, or under open account (O/A) arrangements. The use of the D/A and O/A procedures is restricted to oil firms, export-oriented companies cer- tified or registered by the Central Bank, the Board of Investment, the Garments and Textile Export Board, or the EPZA, exporters of semiconductor devices, export- ers of garments and footwear, and franchised public utility concerns. The use of these procedures by producer firms normally is restricted to commodities in the Essential Producer Goods category. Unless arrange- ments are made for such terms of credit, imports in excess of US$1,000 must be covered by letters of credit opened on or before the day of shipment and are subject to the release certificate requirement. Imports financed by the importer's own foreign exchange or not involving payments from the Philippines (i.e., "no dollar" imports) are allowed, subject to prescribed conditions, and are exempt from the requirement of opening letters of credit. The reserve requirement on marginal deposit on all import letters of credit is 100 percent. At the request of an authorized agent bank or other financial institution, a firm may be "watch listed" by the Central Bank for arrears on its loan repayment commit- ments. A firm thus watch listed may not open import letters of credit without the approval of the Central Bank, which will allow the opening of letters of credit only after a schedule for the repayment of overdue obligations has been agreed upon. Certain authorized agent banks require 50 percent deposit against the opening of letters of credit for such firms, compared with 25 percent in normal cases. There are separate regulations for imports into border regions by barter traders. Payments for Invisibles Virtually all payments to South Africa are prohibited. In principle, all other payments are permitted, with prior PHILIPPINES approval of the Central Bank, provided that amounts of more than US$100 are substantiated by documentary evidence. However, there are certain limits established by the Central Bank for purchases of foreign exchange for travel abroad by residents, remittances for educa- tional expenses, maintenance and expenses of depen- dents of residents while abroad, remittances of profits, dividends, and interest, royalties, and for f i lm and other rentals (see below). Foreign exchange allowance for travel abroad is limited to the following amounts: (a) for both business and nonbusiness travel, irrespective of duration, up to a maximum of US$3,000 for the United States, Canada, South America, Europe, Australia, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and New Zealand (Area I); (b) for both business and nonbusiness travel, irrespective of duration, up to a maximum of US$1,000 for Hong Kong, Taiwan,t the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and other countries not included in the coverage of the area under (a) (Area II); (c) for travelers under 21 years of age, up to a maximum of US$500, irrespective of duration and destination; and (d) for overseas contract workers with prearranged employment, up to a maximum of US$100. Applications for travel abroad for a f if th or subsequent time within one calendar year are subject to careful review by the. agent banks to prevent abuse. A foreign tourist holding a visa valid for up to 59 days may remit abroad up to the equivalent of US$1,000, beyond which approval must be obtained from the Central Bahk. The following limits applyv to exchange for educa- tional expenses abroad for students undertaking bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree courses at duly accredited colleges or universities. The allowances are divided according to the areas in which the study is undertaken: living allowances are provided up to US$500 per month in Area I and US$350 per month in Area II; books and supplies allowances up to US$500 per year in both areas; clothing allowance up to US$500 per year in Area I and US$300 per year in Area II; other miscellaneous school expenses are allowed up to US$500 per year in Area I and US$300 per year in Area II. Any scholarship allowances are deducted from these amounts. High school students may be granted foreign exchange for education only under an exchange program and under the following conditions: the max- imum travel funds per student will be US$500, and the maximum clothing allowance and incidental expenses during his stay abroad will be US$500, or US$1,000 a student a calendar year. The limits on remittances to dependents of residents are as follows: US$250 a month for each dependent living in Area I as defined above, and US$150 a month for each dependent living in Area II. The maintenance allowances for dependents are granted only for close rel- atives under conditions prescribed by the Central Bank.

Not for Redistribution PHILIPPINES October 14, 1984 are permitted in fu l l, provided that remittances are not financed from domestic borrowings. Remittances of royalties or rentals on patents, trade- marks, and copyrights accruing after October 14, 1984 are freely permitted (net of taxes) for contracts registered with the Central Bank, provided that the royalties do not exceed 5 percent of the wholesale price of the commod- ity that is manufactured locally under the royalty contract (2 percent in the case of marketing service contracts), and that contracts do not exceed five-year terms and do not include restrictions on the export of the product. Remittances of the producer's share of earnings made on motion-picture films and rentals on television films are freely permitted, provided generally that the shares or rentals do not exceed 50 percent of net proceeds from films. Notwithstanding other provisions, however, all unserviced eligible nontrade, nonloan remittances (e.g., dividends, profits, royalties, lease payments, fees, com- missions, etc.) earned and which became due and payable before October 15, 1984 and in arrears of transfers as of that date shall not be serviced without prior central bank approval. Foreign exchange within the limits established above may be purchased from authorized agent banks, with the prior approval of the Central Bank. Applications for payments for certain invisibles for which no basic allowance has been set are considered on their merits by the Central Bank. No person may take out or export from the Philippines foreign currency or any other foreign exchange except as authorized by the Central Bank. Residents may take out, as part of their travel allowance, up to US$100 in foreign bank notes. Nonresident travelers may take out any amount of foreign currency that they had previously brought in and declared, less any amounts converted into pesos. Resident and nonresident travelers require prior authorization from the Central Bank to take out more than P 500 in domestic notes and coin or checks, money orders, and other bills of exchange drawn in pesos. When traveling abroad, citizens of the Philippines must pay a travel tax of P 2,700 for first-class passengers and ¥ 1,620 for economy-class passengers. Reduced rates of P 1,350 for first-class passengers and P 810 for econ- omy-class passengers are provided for groups of people traveling for recognized special purposes. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. Exports of certain strategic materials and items deemed essential for industrialization and economic development are also prohibited. Otherwise, exports are generally not re- stricted, but are regulated to ensure that the foreign exchange proceeds are surrendered to an authorized agent of the Central Bank. Authorized agent banks issue the necessary export permits upon registration of the exporter's report of foreign sales (except export permits for gold, which are issued by the Central Bank); reports of foreign sales of copra, coconut oil, and sugar-based commodities, however, are approved for registration 402 only by the Central Bank. Registration of sales of sugar- based commodities requires prior clearance by the Department of Trade. As a general rule, no commodity may be exported unless it is covered by a draft drawn in one of the prescribed currencies (see footnote 1) and unless collec- tion of the proceeds will be undertaken by an authorized agent bank; however, payment by means of telegraphic transfer, check, or mail transfer may be allowed. Payments for exports on a cash, collection, or consign- ment basis must be arranged through an authorized agent bank, which must specifically contract with the exporter to buy the exchange proceeds. No shipment of exports will be allowed by the customs unless a certificate is issued by a bank stating that payment has been received or arranged. Export proceeds must be received in a prescribed currency within 60 days from the date of shipment (or within such period as may be established in special cases) and surrendered to the agent bank within 3 business days of receipt. The undrawn balances of exports involving initial drawings of less than 100 per- cent of the f .o .b. invoice value must be collected and repatriated within 150 days from the date of shipment for exports to Europe, Africa, and Latin America, and 120 days from date of shipment for exports to other coun- tries. An irrevocable letter of credit is required for all exports of scrap metals, copra, and coconut oil, and for all exports to Guam, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and Japan. Exports of perishable commodities to Hong Kong re- quire prepayment. An export tax is levied on the f .o .b. value of certain major exports. The rate is 6 percent for centrifugal sugar; 4 percent for gold, silver, iron ore and concentrates, chromite ore and concentrates, unmanufactured abaca, molasses, canned pineapples, bunker fuel oil, cement clinker, portland cement, petroleum pitch and residues, and lumber and veneer; and 2 percent for bananas. However, the export taxes on sugar, mineral products, molasses, cement, petroleum pitch and residue, as well as bunker fuel, are suspended. The Philippine Sugar Commission has a monopoly over the export of sugar. Export trade with state-trading countries, excluding Yugoslavia, is handled through the Philippine International Trading Corporation. There are separate regulations for exports from border regions by barter traders. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles must be sold within three business days to an authorized agent bank. Whenever the net foreign exchange receipts from invisibles amount to at least US$100,000 (or its equivalent in other curren- cies) for the calendar year immediately preceding, the firm may, upon application, be certified by the Central Bank as export-oriented and shall be entitled to retain a portion of its earnings in a special foreign currency deposit account with AABs for operating expenses abroad and other contingencies, equivalent to the aver- age expenses incurred during the preceding 3 months ©International Monetary Fund.

There are restrictions on sales of foreign exchange for the repatriation of foreign direct cash investments made before March 16, 1973 and noncash investments made after March 15, 1973, de- pending on the category of industry where the invest- ment is made, as follows: (1) investments in export- oriented industries certified by the Central Bank are repatriable in fu l l, but no annual installment may exceed the applicant's share in the net foreign exchange earnings of the firm in the preceding year; (2) investments in enterprises registered with the BOI, producing import substitutes or exports, are repatriable in three equal annual installments starting one year after the liquidation of the investment, but no annual installment may exceed the total net foreign exchange earnings in the preceding year; (3) investments in enterprises registered with the BOI (not included in (2) above and not utilizing domestic credit resources) are repatriable in three equal annual installments starting one year after the liquidation of the investment; and (4) for investments in the remaining plus 10 percent of the gross foreign exchange receipts during the immediately preceding 12 months. Philippine nationals employed abroad are permitted to open U .S. dollar deposit accounts with authorized agent banks, in which they may retain any U .S. dollars they remit to the Philippines. To be eligible for credit to such accounts, earnings must be transferred through Philip- pine diplomatic establishments. Under a foreign cur- rency deposit scheme, inward remittances of foreign currencies by residents or nonresidents for deposit in numbered foreign currency accounts are allowed, provided that the remittances represent neither current earnings or income of residents nor payments by nonresi- dents pursuant to contractual obligations. Balances in such accounts are freely transferable abroad. Philippine nationals working abroad are required to repatriate specified minimum shares of their foreign earnings, ranging from 50 percent to 80 percent. Travelers may freely bring in any amount of foreign currency and up to P 500 in domestic notes and coin and checks, money orders, and other bills of exchange drawn in pesos, of which not more than P 50 may consist of Philippine coin. Peso-denominated gold coins issued by the Central Bank of the Philippines are exempt from these requirements. Capital Virtually all payments and transfers to South Africa are prohibited. Remittances of foreign exchange for repayment of principal on all foreign obligations of whatever maturity due to foreign banks or other financial institutions during the period October 17, 1983 to January 16, 1985 are subject to prior approval by the Central Bank. All inward and outward capital move- ments, with the exception of certain banking operations and certain transactions related to financing of interna- tional trade (see below), are subject to the prior and specific approval of the Central Bank. When applica- tions for new inward foreign investments (in kind or in cash), as well as new foreign borrowings are reviewed, preference is given to projects approved by the BOI, to export-oriented industries, and to other (nonexport- oriented) industries not utilizing domestic credit re- sources. The law guarantees full repatriation of cash investments made after March 15, 1973 in export- oriented industries that have been certified by the Central Bank, in enterprises registered with the BOI, and in securities certified by the Central Bank and traded on the Manila and Makati Stock Exchanges. As a minimum, foreign investors must hold securities for at least 90 days before the proceeds become eligible for repatriation. Foreign companies are eligible to borrow pesos from domestic sources, provided they have a debt-equity ratio of 60:40 in high-priority sectors, 55:45 in medium- priority sectors, and 50:50 in low-priority sectors. Foreign direct cash investments made after March 15, 1973 and registered with the Central Bank are freely repatriable, except for investments in domestic commer- cial banks, which, if made after March 31, 1973, are freely repatriable and if made before that date are PHILIPPINES banks (FCDUs) are empowered to borrow funds from international money markets for domestic on-lending. Nonbank residents may obtain suppliers' credits from abroad, provided that repayment terms are within the limits prescribed by the Central Bank. Maturities of long-term loans or repayment terms should be as follows: (1) US$250,000 or less, three years; (2) over US$250,000 up to US$500,000, five years; (3) over US$500,000 up to US$3 million, seven years; and (4) over US$3 million, eight to ten years. Firms whose products are clearly destined for export, as well as firms earning foreign exchange and duly certified as belonging to other priority areas (food, energy, infrastructure, transport, and communication) with appropriate govern- ment agencies, may secure credits in excess of US$3 million with a minimum repayment period of seven to eight years. Interest rates may not be more than 1.5 percent above the prime rate of the lending country. Applications are not approved if the proposed project expands capacity in an industry deemed to be over- crowded or for firms that are in arrears with government financial institutions. Any prospective borrowing equiv- alent to US$3 million or more must be submitted for inclusion in the Central Bank's programming of external credit resources. Sales of foreign exchange for amortiza- tion of loans are permitted in accordance with the terms of loan contracts approved by the Central Bank. The same applies for loan contracts registered with the Central Bank prior to November 26, 1969. For those not falling under these two categories, prior approval by the Central Bank is required for sales of foreign exchange for repayment of loans. Emigrants may transfer up to US$5,000, subject to verification by the Central Bank. The remaining liquid assets may be withdrawn in five years beginning one year from emigration. Outward investment by resident persons, firms, or corporations requires prior approval of the Central Bank through the Management of External Debt and Invest- ment Accounts Department. Except as otherwise specif- ically authorized, resident persons, firms, or corpora- tions may not enter into any contract or transaction which may involve settlement in foreign exchange, or involving any assets belonging to them expressed in foreign currencies or payable or deliverable abroad. This restriction also applies to contracts or transactions involving assets within the Philippines belonging to a nonresident person, firm, or corporation, and to their export or import. Detailed regulations are in force concerning transactions in securities between residents and nonresidents. Twenty-five foreign banks have been authorized to operate offshore banking units in the Philippines. These units may engage in a wide range of foreign currency transactions with nonresidents and with other offshore units. Offshore banking units may open and maintain deposit accounts in pesos with domestic agent banks exclusively to meet administrative and other operating expenses and to pay to designated local beneficiaries of 404 nonresident Filipinos the equivalent of foreign exchange remittances channeled through the offshore banking units' correspondent banks abroad. Offshore banking units may also sell inward remittances of foreign exchange to the Central Bank. All investors in enterprises registered with the BOI are guaranteed the right to repatriate their investments and to remit earnings thereon as well as sums needed to meet payments of principal and interest on foreign loans; they are also guaranteed freedom from expropriation and requisition. There are different arrangements for "pioneer investments" and "preferred investments"; the former are granted certain incentives over and above those given to preferred investments. Normally, enterprises owned or controlled by foreign nationals are permitted to operate only in "pioneer areas of investment," and at least 60 percent of the outstanding voting capital stock of registered enterprises in "pre- ferred areas of investment" must be owned by Philippine nationals. Under the Foreign Investment Law of 1968, new enterprises where investment by non-Filipinos exceeds 30 percent and which are not covered by the Investment Incentives Act of 1967 must obtain prior authority from the BOI in order to engage in any economic activity in the Philippines. If purchases of shares of common stock by foreign nationals would reduce Philippine ownership in a firm to less than 70 percent, permission from the BOI must first be obtained. Gold Producers of gold may be eligible for assistance under the Gold Industry Assistance Act, irrespective of whether the gold is a by-product or the principal or only product of their operations. The Central Bank purchases the entire output of the 14 domestic primary gold producers. The producers are paid in Philippine pesos on the basis of the latest London fixing price and the prevailing Philippine peso-U.S. dol- lar exchange rate. The gold so acquired is deemed to be part of official international reserves. Small gold panners are exempt from the scheme. Gold in any form other than jewelry may be imported only for industrial and artistic purposes, and any person desiring to import gold must secure a license from the appropriate department of the Central Bank. Various denominations of gold coins have been issued by the Central Bank of the Philippines as follows: a 1-Peso Paul VI coin (1970), a 1,000-Piso Ang Bagong Lipunan coin (1975), a 1,500-Piso IMF-IBRD coin (1976), the 1,500-Piso Ang Bagong Lipunan coins (1977 and 1978), a 5,000-Piso Ang Bagong Lipunan coin (1977), a 2,500-Piso Douglas Mac Arthur centenary coin (1980), and a 1,500-Piso Pope John Paul II coin (1981). Transactions in legal tender gold coins are governed by the provisions of Central Bank Circular No. 570, dated June 9, 1977. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Central Bank; such licenses are not normally granted except for ©International Monetary Fund.

Not for Redistribution PORTUGAL (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Portugal is the Portuguese Escudo, the exchange rate of which is adjusted at relatively short intervals in relation to a basket of currencies, weighted according to their importance in Portugal's international merchandise trade. Periodically the Bank of Portugal announces depreciation objectives for the effective ex- change rate of the escudo: the monthly rate of deprecia- tion, which was initially set in May 1978 at 1.25 percent but was lowered progressively to 0.50 percent by June 1980, was raised to 1 percent in March 1983. On December 31, 1984 the authorized banks' buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were Esc 195.613 and Esc 196.437, respectively, per US$1. Rates for other currencies1 are quoted by the Bank of Portugal on the basis of U .S. dollar rates in exchange markets abroad. There is a tax of 0.6 percent on all sales of foreign exchange. The Macao pataca is pegged to the Hong Kong dollar at a parity rate of P 1.03 = HK$1. Authorized banks may deal in foreign exchange with the Bank of Portugal. They are also normally allowed to deal in foreign exchange with banks abroad at the rates prevailing in the Portuguese foreign exchange market. They are not allowed to buy and sell foreign exchange among themselves or to enter into arbitrage operations in foreign markets. In dealing with their customers, the authorized banks buy and sell foreign exchange in convertible currencies for their own account. Purchases and sales of unquoted currencies can be made only through an authorized bank acting on a commission basis. Banks are required to obtain the prior approval of the Bank of Portugal to accept deposits in foreign currencies from residents or nonresidents and to obtain short-term credits abroad. The banks may use their foreign exchange holdings for all authorized purposes, but the Ministry of Finance may set limits on the use of these resources and, in certain circumstances, may require that foreign exchange assets be sold to the Bank of Portugal. The net foreign asset positions of the authorized banks and their gross foreign exchange holdings are subject to ceilings. Administration of Control Exchange controls are administered by the Bank of Portugal on behalf of the Ministry of Finance, with the assistance of the commercial banks authorized for this purpose. Foreign trade policy is formulated and implemented by the Ministry of Commerce and Tourism; almost all foreign trade transactions are subject to prior registration 1 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Italian lire, Irish pounds, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, South African rand, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. 410 with the Ministry. The Director-General of Foreign Commerce in this Ministry is responsible for administer- ing trade controls. Import and export bulletins are issued by a department within the Directorate-General of Foreign Commerce or by other authorized executive departments. State agencies undertaking international trade transactions are required to use Portuguese vessels. Prescription of Currency Transactions with Turkey are settled on a monthly basis through a clearing account maintained in U .S. dol- lars. Export transactions with other countries may be settled in the quoted currencies (see footnote 1) or in U .S. dollars. (Canadian dollars, Finnish markkaa, Irish pounds, Japanese yen, South African rand, and Spanish pesetas may only be used in transactions with the countries issuing the currency.) Payments to nonresi- dents may be made by crediting escudos to a nonresident account, the opening of which is subject to prior approval by the Bank of Portugal. Nonresident Accounts Foreign Accounts in Escudos are divided into (1) Time Foreign Accounts in Escudos, for which the opening, debiting, and crediting are subject to special advance authorization of the Bank of Portugal, and (2) Demand Foreign Accounts in Escudos, which may be opened, debited, and credited without prior authorization of the Bank of Portugal for payments for transactions authorized in escudos concerning imports and exports of goods, services, and capital between Portugal and foreign countries and for transfers between such ac- counts. For all other debit and credit operations, authori- zation of the Bank of Portugal is required. The granting of credit in the form of overdrafts on the accounts described above requires the authorization of the Bank of Portugal. Foreign Accounts in Escudos in the names of persons resident or domiciled in Turkey, with which Portugal has a special clearing arrangement, are opened, debited, and credited according to instructions issued by the Bank of Portugal. Special accounts in escudos have been established to which must be credited those Portuguese bank notes that have been presented by foreign correspondents and are in excess of the amounts that may be credited to Demand Foreign Accounts in Escudos. These accounts may be debited only for payments in escudos to residents, subject to the prior authorization of the Bank of Portugal. Deposit accounts in escudos may be opened by Portuguese emigrants. Such accounts may be in the form of current accounts, accounts requiring advance notice of withdrawal, or time accounts. Without prior authoriza- tion from the Bank of Portugal, deposit accounts may be credited only w i th remittances from abroad received ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution through the banking system or in the form of an international postal order, the equivalent in escudos of external means of payment sold to credit institutions by emigrants, and interest due on such deposits. Deposit accounts may be debited without restrictions. Nonresidents may open time foreign accounts in nine foreign currencies. Such accounts may be credited with remittances from abroad and with the related interest due and may be debited without restrictions. However, a nonresident wishing to use the funds in these accounts in Portugal is subject to the exchange regulations currently in force. There are also provisions for resident accounts in foreign currencies. Imports and Import Payments Imports of certain products are prohibited or are allowed only under specific conditions, mainly for reasons of health, public order, and the prevention of commercial fraud. Any physical or juridical entity may be an importer; importers must have an import entitle- ment and must pay income taxes regularly. Prior registration (in the form of a "bulletin") is required for all imports valued at over Esc 15,000. Most imports from all sources are effected on the basis of "bulletins." For imports free of quantitative restric- tion, the bulletin enables the importer to obtain the necessary foreign exchange. For imports subject to restriction, the bulletin is equivalent to an import license. The validity of the bulletin is 3 months for customs clearance purposes and 12 months from the date of customs clearance for settlement purposes; in special cases, longer validity periods may be granted. Personal baggage and imports of merchandise, the value of which does not exceed Esc 15,000, do not require a bulletin, except when forming part of an order with a total value exceeding Esc 15,000 and provided they are not ex- pressly excluded from this exemption. Imports of books up to Esc 60,000 and of newspapers and technical, scientific, or cultural periodicals up to Esc 200,000 are also exempt from the bulletins. Payments beyond one year after customs clearance require the approval of the Bank of Portugal. Imports of certain items, such as unassembled auto- mobiles, household appliances, and fruits, are subject temporarily to quota limitations in value terms. Goods not on the negative list may be imported freely from most countries that are members of the GATT. The negative list includes certain foodstuffs and other agri- cultural products, certain natural or manufactured raw materials, some textile fibers, and a small number of finished products, including motor vehicles; the items on the list are subject to quantitative restrictions for protec- tive reasons or are under special regimes. A somewhat more extensive negative list applies to Japan. The GATT liberalization does not apply to Ghana and Nigeria; imports from these GATT members of goods that would be liberalized if imported from other GATT countries are subject to individual authorization, which is granted on PORTUGAL the merits of the case. Nonliberalized imports from countries that are GATT members are admitted under individual authorization. All imports from countries that are not members of the GATT are based on individual authorizations; imports from some Eastern European countries are generally licensed in accordance with bilateral trading arrangements. There are a few bilateral quotas for specified agricul- tural imports from certain EFT A countries. Imports of nonliberalized industrial products, except for certain protected steel products and automobiles, are free of quantitative restriction when originating in EFTA or EC countries. Special legislation provides that automobiles must be assembled in Portugal, and the assembly is subject to the use of certain minimum percentages of domestic components. However, imports of passenger automobiles of non-EFTA and non-EC origin are allowed up to 15 units a producer a year for those makes not assembled in Portugal and, for other makes, up to 2 percent of the number of vehicles of the same make that were assembled in Portugal in the preceding year. Imports of some makes of EFTA and EC origin were allowed up to 500 units for each producer in 1982 and were allowed up to 600 units for each producer in 1983 and 1984. Imports of certain vehicles for special pur- poses are free of restrictions. Domestic credit financing is restricted for certain imports and foreign financing is required for certain imports. Minimum proportions of foreign financing and minimum repayment terms are prescribed by the Bank of Portugal. Many imports are subject to a temporary import surcharge of 10 percent of the customs value, irrespective of origin. Payments for Invisibles Payments to foreign countries for current invisibles must be made through authorized banks and are gener- ally free of quantitative restrictions, but for most transactions ceilings are specified for the amounts of foreign exchange that authorized banks may grant freely. For payments to countries with which Portugal does not maintain special clearing arrangements, the autho- rized banks may grant foreign exchange up to the equivalent of Esc 200,000 a transaction for most types of invisibles, and the licensing centers (established in continental Portugal and the Azores) of those banks may grant up to the equivalent of Esc 5 million. For tourism and other private travel they may grant to persons 18 years of age or over the equivalent of Esc 70,000 a person a year, Esc 50,000 for persons between 12 and 18, and Esc 30,000 for children under 12; in addition, tourists may take out of the country Esc 5,000 in local currency for each trip. The export of larger amounts of domestic or foreign currency requires the prior authori- zation of the Bank of Portugal. Application must be made to the Bank of Portugal for exchange for payments of items not referred to above and for payments in excess of the above-mentioned limits. 411 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PORTUGAL Under the provisions of the Foreign Investment Code, individual remittances of profits and dividends may be subject to phasing for a period of up to one year, depending on the prevailing balance of payments situa- tion. Phased amounts awaiting remittance may be depos- ited with domestic banks in accounts denominated in foreign exchange. Special provisions apply to situations of serious external imbalance, or when the amount involved is so large as to be deemed to entail serious economic and financial disturbance to the country; in such cases, individual remittances of profits and divi- dends may be suspended for a period of time to be determined by the Council of Ministers, but annual remittance of at least 20 percent of the amount involved shall always be authorized. By the end of 1984, these special provisions were, however, not in force. Exports and Export Proceeds Prior registration is required for all exports valued at over Esc 15,000. Exports are effected on the basis of "bulletins" (similar to the import bulletins). Export bulletins are issued freely, with few exceptions; the primary purpose of this procedure is to enforce the prescription of currency and surrender regulations. The export of a few commodities is restricted, mainly to assure adequate supplies to domestic industries and to avoid depletion of local resources. Personal baggage and exports of merchandise, the value of which do not exceed Esc 15,000, do not require a bulletin, provided they are not expressly excluded from this exemption. Re- exports of merchandise are exempt from prior registra- tion, regardless of their value. Exporters are required to sell to an authorized bank the total amount of the export proceeds, within the period and in the foreign currency stipulated in the export bulletin; the period for repatriation of export proceeds is, as a rule, fixed at four months from the date of customs clearance. Should settlement for exports occur later than four months after customs clearance, the exchange rate prevailing on the last day of the four-month period from the date of customs clearance would be applied. The Bank of Portugal may authorize the deduction of commission expenses abroad and freight, insurance, or other charges from the total amount subject to surrender. Proceeds from Invisibles Portuguese residents may receive freely payments in foreign currency for invisibles from residents of coun- tries with which Portugal does not have bilateral pay- ments arrangements. Such receipts may be effected through credit institutions and do not require prior authorization by the Bank of Portugal. Receipts from invisibles must be surrendered. Nonresident travelers may bring in freely up to Esc 5,000 in domestic bank notes and any amount in bank notes, coin, and checks denominated in foreign currency for their travel expenses; imports of notes and coin by nonresidents for other purposes require authori- zation by the Bank of Portugal, and the re-export by 412 nonresident travelers of foreign currency in excess of Esc 25,000 requires proof of prior importation of an equal or larger amount. Returning residents may bring in up to Esc 5,000 in domestic bank notes and any amount in foreign bank notes and coin. Authorized banks are not permitted to receive or to pay domestic or foreign bank notes or coin for settlement of external transactions. Capital All private capital transactions between Portugal and foreign countries are subject to prior authorization by the Bank of Portugal, and for transactions exceeding Esc 800 million and with a maturity of more than one year, the approval of the Minister of Finance also is required. Foreign direct investments in Portugal are authorized on the basis of the Foreign Investment Code. Such investments are permitted in all sectors except those wh ich, under the general law, are closed to private enterprise corporations. An Exchange Risk Insurance Fund provides exchange risk insurance against losses caused by exchange rate movements in excess of 3 percent on approved foreign borrowing. When the transfer abroad of the proceeds from the liquidation of foreign investments involves large amounts, the Bank of Portugal may require that the transfer be phased over a period not exceeding five years. In such cases, exchange risk guarantees may be provided. Foreign loans and their repayments are autho- rized as necessary. Capital movements and transfers of assets are subject to ceilings (up to which they are authorized auto- matically), according to Portugal's reservations to the OECD code of liberalization of capital movements. For larger amounts authorizations may be granted on the merits of each case. Direct transactions in foreign exchange between residents are prohibited. Gold Residents may hold gold in any form in Portugal. The purchase, sale, import, export, or re-export of bullion or coined and unworked gold, when carried out between Portugal and foreign countries, is subject to special advance authorization from the Bank of Portugal. There is a free market for gold in Macao, in which both residents of Macao and nonresidents who are not resident in Portugal may freely trade among themselves in bars, leaves, and coins. In Macao, the Government sets overall limits for imports of gold in any form other than jewelry; authority to carry out such imports is delegated to a concessionary enterprise. Imports and exports of gold, unless made by or on behalf of the Macao monetary authorities, require licenses issued by the Commissioner for Economy. Changes During 1984 Nonresident Accounts May 10.

Not for Redistribution QATAR (Position on December 37, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Qatar is the Qatar Riyal, which is pegged to the SDR at QR 4.7619 = SDR 1. Qatar has established margins of 7.25 percent around this rate. The Qatar Monetary Agency sets daily market rates for the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, and the pound sterling. The commercial banks' exchange rates for transac- tions in U.S. dollars are based on the Monetary Agen- cy's buying and selling rates. A spread of 0.87 dirham is applied to exchange transactions with the public. The commercial banks' buying and selling rates for other currencies are based on the Monetary Agency's rates for the U .S. dollar and market rates for the currency concerned against the U .S. dollar. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Qatar formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, with effect from June 4, 1973. Administration of Control The Qatar Monetary Agency is the exchange control authority, but there is at present no exchange control legislation. Import licenses are issued by the Ministry of Economy and Commerce. Prescription of Currency All settlements with Israel and South Africa are prohibited. No other prescription of currency require- ments are in force. Nonresident Accounts No distinction is made between accounts held by residents and those held by nonresidents. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Israel and South Africa are pro- hibited. Also prohibited are imports of pork and its derivatives. Imports of alcoholic beverages, firearms, ammunition, and certain drugs are subject to licensing for reasons of health or public policy. Otherwise, imports are not restricted. There are no restrictions on payments for permitted imports. Imports of general goods are subject to a customs duty at the rate of 4.0 per- cent, being the minimum recommended rate under the Gulf Cooperation Council. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Otherwise, all commodities may be exported freely. There are no requirements attached to receipts from exports or re-exports; the proceeds need not be repatri- ated or surrendered, and they may be disposed of free ly, regardless of the currency involved. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments may not be made to or received from Israel and South Africa. Otherwise, there are no limitations on payments for and proceeds from invisibles. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or payments by residents or nonresidents, although payments may not be made to or received from Israel and South Africa. Foreign participation in certain industrial enterprises is prohibited unless Qatar nationals control at least 51 percent of the shares. For major industrial projects, it is government policy to assume a m in imum of 70 percent ownership. Gold The monetary authorities and all other residents and nonresidents (including private persons) may freely and without license purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad. For trading purposes, the selling and buying of gold and precious metals are subject to import license and customs du ty. Transactions involving Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Changes During 1984 Imports and Import Payments August 22. The m in imum customs duty on general goods was raised from 2.5 percent to 4.0 percent, to bring Qatar into line with the m in imum recommended rates under the Gulf Cooperation Council. 414 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ROMANIA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Romania is the Romanian Leu. The exchange rate used for all trade transactions in convert- ible currencies is the commercial rate, which is defined in terms of a basket of six currencies reflecting the geographical pattern of Romania's trade and payments. Weekly adjustments are made in the leu/U.S. dollar rate (and correspondingly in the rates for all other quoted currencies) in such a way as to maintain the central point on the basket peg. On December 31, 1984 the commer- cial exchange rate was lei 17.79 = US$1. The National Bank of Romania quotes rates for 16 other currencies defined as "fully convertible"1 and for the Finnish markka, the Greek drachma, the Indian rupee, the Israel shekel, the Portuguese escudo, the Spanish peseta, the Turkish lira, and the Yugoslav dinar, based on the rates for these currencies against the U.S. dollar in the countries concerned. For currencies of other countries, exchange rates are based on rates quoted in Romania for third currencies; for members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA),2 Albania, and the Dem- ocratic People's Republic of Korea, the third currency used for this purpose is the transferable ruble (TR); on December 31, 1984 the transferable ruble rate was lei 15.50 per TR 1. For exchange rate purposes, payments for insurance and transportation connected with trade are considered as trade transactions. With the exception of payments and receipts for travel arranged through tourist organizations, which are considered commercial transactions, and of most capital transactions (excluding transfer of inher- itances), nontrade exchange transactions are carried out at the noncommercial exchange rate, with the exception of those with member countries of the CMEA, Albania, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Capital transactions other than those with the latter group of countries are settled at the commercial rate. The non- commercial rate is pegged to the same basket of currencies as the commercial rate and is also adjusted on a weekly basis; the rate was lei 12.70 = US$1 on December 31, 1984. For the nontransport component of the expenses for individual travel to nonsocialist countries and Yugos- lavia and for certain other expenditures abroad, such as personal subscriptions to periodicals and legal penalties, a 100 percent tax is levied on purchases of foreign exchange. For nontrade transactions with the CMEA countries, Albania, and the Democratic People's Re- public of Korea, special exchange rates are established Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Irish pounds, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Luxembourg francs, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. 2The participants in the CMEA are Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, U .S .S .R ., and Viet Nam. by multilateral or bilateral agreement; for transactions with the U .S .S .R ., this rate is lei 8.30 per rub 1. For persons working abroad in technical assistance jobs or as professionals, such as medical doctors, daily allowances are paid in foreign exchange, and any accumulated surpluses can be converted into lei at the noncommercial exchange rate. Romanians working in international organizations or joint ventures, as well as those occasionally receiving foreign exchange income, are required to repatriate a part of it as a contribution to the fund for training of staff involved in international cooperation and for the maintenance of their families at home. Administration of Control Foreign trade is a state monopoly. Import and export transactions are effected by foreign trade enterprises and other authorized units. Import and export transactions are subject to authorizations granted by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and International Economic Cooperation. In the issuing of authorizations the provisions of existing trade agreements are taken into account. Foreign cur- rency proceeds from exports are sold to the Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade; foreign currency required for import payments is purchased from that bank. Exchange control is administered by the Ministry of Finance, the National Bank, and the Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade. Prescription of Currency Payments to and from countries with which Romania has bilateral payments agreements are made in curren- cies and in accordance with the procedures set forth in those agreements.3 If no agreement exists, settlement is usually made in a convertible currency. Certain commer- cial settlements with Turkey are made in U .S. dollars under a credit agreement. Permitted foreign payments may not be made in lei. Nonresident Accounts Foreign juridical and physical persons may maintain accounts with the Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade, the National Bank, or with foreign banks having branch offices in Romania. These accounts are of three kinds: A-Accounts are maintained in convertible currency, or in lei obtained for convertible currencies from the selling of precious metals, coins, or ingots, other than silver; B-Accounts are maintained in nonconvertible currencies 3 The countries w i th which bilateral payments agreements were in force as of December 31, 1984 were Albania, Bangladesh, People's Republic of China, Colombia, Ecuador, Ghana, Ind ia, Islamic Re- public of Iran, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Viet Nam. Settlements w i th Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, German Demo- cratic Republic, Hungary, Mongolia, Poland, and U .S .S .R. take place through the multilateral payments system w i th in the International Bank for Economic Cooperation. 415 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ROMANIA quoted by the National Bank, in clearing currency, or in lei received from the conversion of such currencies. Transactions in any individual B-Account may be ef- fected in only one such currency. C-Accounts are maintained in lei received from other legal sources. A-Accounts may be debited for payments abroad in any currency, for payments within the country, and for transfers to any other A-, B-, or C-Account. B-Accounts may be debited for all payments abroad in the currencies from which the funds were derived and for payments within Romania. C-Accounts may be debited only for domestic transactions. The transactions permitted for the different accounts do not require any further authoriza- tion. Nonresidents may also keep accounts in lei with the Savings and Consignment Bank. The Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade may accept from nonresident custom- ers time deposits in convertible foreign currencies, on which interest is paid at rates prevailing in international markets. Romanian citizens, including Romanians working abroad who transfer their savings to Romania, may open foreign currency accounts with the Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade or the National Bank. The deposits may be used for payments in foreign currency, at home or abroad, or for exchange into lei at the noncommercial exchange rate. The entire amount of foreign exchange received from abroad for special purposes for the benefit of Romanian citizens (such as the building or purchasing of a house, the purchase of an automobile, the purchase of other goods or services whose prices are expressed in foreign currency, travel abroad, and other purposes) may be used by the recipients. For certain other foreign exchange receipts from abroad, such as inheritances, donations, assistance, or family maintenance, a propor- tion may be deposited in a foreign currency account and the rest must be converted into lei at the noncommercial exchange rate. Imports and Exports The administrative framework for planning and ex- ecuting foreign trade in Romania is provided in the Foreign Trade Law (Law No. 12 of December 1980). International economic activity is organized and carried out in accordance with the principle of working people's self-management and self-administration of economic, financial, and foreign exchange. The general policy targets for foreign trade are set at the central level. Import and export plans are drawn up by the basic economic un i ts, production enterprises, and industrial centrals on the basis of current and long-term needs. The foreign trade plan specifies only a limited number of goods considered of particular importance for the national economy, especially raw materials. The total planned trade does not separate importing or exporting countries but distinguishes between the clear- ing area and the convertible currency area, according to the manner of settlement of exchange payments and receipts. Import and export transactions are carried out on the 416 basis of authorizations issued by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and International Economic Cooperation, for each commodity or group of commodities. The authorizations are not restrictive or discriminatory and may be issued, at the request of foreign trade units, for all types of goods, regardless of origin. The Ministry may take measures to curb imports with a view to equilibrating the balance of payments, for the protection of public health, for reasons of national defense and the security of the State, etc., in accordance with the provisions of the GATT. As a rule, annual import authorizations ex- pressed in value terms are issued to individual importing enterprises as a lump sum or for a single kind of product. The authorization stipulates whether import payments are to be made in convertible currency or under bilateral payments arrangements, and, in the latter case, the country is also specified. Export proceeds must be sold to the Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade. Imports for investment in complex installations (as- semblies, subassemblies, machinery, equipment, and spare parts) are delivered to the buying units at domestic prices which are equal to the customs value (calculated by multiplying the external price by the commercial rate) plus customs duties. Imports of consumer goods are delivered to the commercial purchasing units at retail prices less the commercial discount. The difference between prices so derived and prices calculated on the basis of customs value plus customs duties and, in some cases, the turnover tax, is reflected in the financial accounts of the importing foreign trade unit. Imports are subject to customs duties, although duties are not applied to 121 tariff positions and subpositions. Customs duties are temporarily not being levied on imports of raw materials, assemblies, subassemblies, and spare parts for production, repair, and maintenance, totaling about 500 tariff positions and subpositions. The customs tariff is nondiscriminatory. Decree No. 3377 1981 issued on November 26, 1981 increased tariffs on personal imports of certain items into Romania above the value limits for the specified goods. The import goods prohibited to individuals include passenger cars with high fuel consumption, minibuses, firearms, and air conditioners. Customs duties on personal imports of a number of consumer durables, such as motorcycles and electrical appliances, are levied at rates of between 100 percent and 300 percent above the applicable customs tariff. Invisibles All transactions in invisibles not connected with foreign trade transactions require general or individual authorization given by either the Ministry of Finance or another appropriate ministry. For most categories of payments in respect of invisibles, foreign exchange is made available automatically once the transaction has been authorized. For travel outside the socialist countries an exchange allocation is provided up to the equivalent of US$70 a trip for each adult. In addition, tourist agencies may organize group or individual trips payable ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution in lei. Receipts from transactions in invisibles must be sold to the Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade, and the foreign currency required for payments in respect of such transactions is bought from the same bank. With specified exceptions, travelers with permanent residence in nonsocialist countries must convert at least US$10 a person a day (or the equivalent in other "acceptable" currencies)4 during their stay in Romania. This requirement does not apply to (a) holders of diplomatic and service passports and their families; (b) newspaper and radio and television correspondents accredited to Romania and their families; (c) persons studying in Romania and their spouses; (d) permanent foreign personnel of foreign firms or agencies authorized to operate in Romania (including joint ventures) and their families; (e) guests of socialist units and of other juridical persons in Romania, as well as of international organizations having their headquarters in Romania; (f) children under 14; (g) teachers visiting Romania under agreements for cultural, technical, and scientific cooperation and their families; (h) persons who can be shown to have made payments for tourist services; (i) foreign personnel in assembly works or providing technical assistance in Romania and their families; (j) persons of Romanian origin having foreign citizen- ship or who are stateless; (k) Romanian citizens pos- sessing a valid Romanian passport who are domiciled abroad; (1) persons resident abroad without a valid Romanian passport, but who have not renounced their Romanian citizenship; and (m) parents, spouses, and children of persons in categories (j)-(!). Foreign diplo- mats and tourists, as well as Romanian citizens legally holding foreign currencies, may purchase certain domes- tically produced or imported consumer goods in special- ized shops, against payment in convertible currencies. The import and export of Romanian notes and coin by travelers are prohibited, with the exception of those coming from CMEA member countries, Albania, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; they may each bring in or take out up to lei 500 a trip in accordance with agreements concluded with these countries. Capital All inward and outward transfers of foreign exchange must be authorized by the Ministry of Finance. Outward 4The acceptable currencies, in addition to the U .S. dollar, are Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Greek drachmas, Indian rupees, Israel shekels, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Luxembourg francs, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, Turkish liras, and Yugoslav dinars. ROMANIA transfers of funds belonging to resident physical persons are not normally permitted. For certain established categories, such as inheritances, reciprocal agreements have been concluded with a number of countries pro- viding for automatic authorization of transfers of speci- fied amounts to and from Romania. The Foreign Trade Law provides for the establishment of joint ventures in Romania and abroad by Romanian economic organizations. Foreigners are also allowed to invest capital in joint ventures in Romania, up to 49 per- cent of the total capital of the company concerned. The Foreign Trade Law and implementing decrees guarantee the repatriation in foreign currency of the capital, and the transfer in foreign currency of profits after taxes. By agreement, the accounts of joint ventures may be kept in an agreed currency. Gold The National Bank has sole authority to purchase or sell gold in any manner, at home or abroad. The Bank, in turn, authorizes certain juridical persons to hold gold, to use it, and to engage in gold transactions. The ownership by physical persons, for domestic and personal use, of jewelry and of artistic and cultural objects of gold is not restricted. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement January 1. The commercial rate was depreciated against the U .S. dollar by 15 percent from lei 18.33 to lei 21.56 per US$1; as the noncommercial rate was not adjusted correspondingly, the spread between the two rates was increased. November 1. The commercial rate was appreciated against the U.S. dollar by 32.5 percent, from lei 23.18 to lei 17.50 per US$1; the noncommercial rate was appre- ciated by 20.8 percent against the U .S. dollar, from lei 15.10 to lei 12.50 per US$1; and the official rate was appreciated from lei 5.00 to lei 4.47 per US$1. In addition, the lei/transferable ruble (TR) rate was changed from lei 17.50 to lei 15.50 per TR 1. Prescription of Currency January 1. The bilateral payment agreement with Brazil ceased to constitute a restrictive practice as it was changed in such a way that (i) all balances had to be settled within 90 days in convertible currencies, and (ii) outstanding balances were made subject to an interest rate equal to 90 percent of the arithmetic mean of the three-month LIBOR prevailing at the first working day of each calendar month of the period of f inanc ing. 417 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution RWANDA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Rwanda is the Rwanda Franc, which is pegged to the SDR at RF 102.71 = SDR 1. This fixed relationship is used to determine the midpoint between buying and selling exchange rates quoted by the Banque Nationale du Rwanda (the central bank) for spot delivery of Rwanda francs against the U.S. dollar and other currencies. Calculations of exchange rates against other currencies are based on the fixed value of the SDR in terms of Rwanda francs and the SDR value of the U.S. dollar and other currencies published by the Fund two business days earlier. On December 31, 1984 the midpoint between the buying and selling rate for spot delivery of Rwanda francs against the U.S. dollar was RF 104.35 per US$1. The buying and selling rates for all currencies are set 1 percent below and 1 percent above the middle rate, respectively. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Control over foreign exchange transactions and foreign trade is vested in the central bank; authority to carry out some of these transactions is delegated to authorized banks. Exchange policy and foreign trade policy are, in principle, determined by the General Foreign Exchange and Licensing Committee, which comprises the Minister of Finance, the Governor of the National Bank, and five other members; however, this Committee is inoperative. Prescription of Currency The National Bank has concluded agreements with the central banks of neighboring countries and Kenya, under which settlements are made through reciprocal accounts in convertible domestic currency. Balances on such accounts are periodically transferable. Otherwise, pay- ments for imports must be made in the currency approved by the National Bank, which, in principle, is the currency of the country of origin. Payments from any country may be received in Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, deutsche mark, French francs, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, and U .S. dollars. Foreign payments, except in border trade, are generally made by bank transfer; the National Bank may, however, authorize other means of payment such as checks or telegraphic transfers. Exchange transactions with South Africa are prohibited. Imports and Import Payments Imports from South Africa are prohibited. Imports of a few types of goods, such as explosives and weapons, 418 from all sources require prior authorization, for reasons of public security. Imports of narcotics are prohibited. All imports valued at over RF 100,000 c. & f. Kigali require licenses, as do those valued at less than RF 100,000 c. & f. Kigali, if payment is required in foreign exchange. Import licenses for toilet and pow- dered soap, candles, and insecticides are temporarily suspended. No license is required for the import of merchandise valued below RF 100,000 c. & f. Kigali, if use of official exchange is not involved. Imports of household goods and personal effects of nonresidents and resident expatriates are also exempt. For a number of consumer goods, mostly of a luxury nature, the validation of import licenses for payment in foreign exchange is subject to the opening at an authorized bank of an interest-bearing time deposit account for 100 percent of the c. & f. value of the imports. The deposits are for three months in the case of imports by air or when the country of origin has a common border with Rwanda or with Kenya; in other cases, the deposit period is six months. Exempt from the import deposit obligation are imports by government bodies and imports of food and beverages by the hotels. The National Bank levies a validation fee of 1 percent of the f .o .b. value on import licenses that involve use of official foreign exchange and on import licenses that are subject to the control of the Societe Generate de Surveillance (SGS) of Geneva. The validation of other import licenses is subject to a processing fee of RF 750 in each case. Before orders are placed, applications for import licenses must be sub- mitted to the National Bank through an authorized bank. Unless otherwise specified, the approval of an import license application constitutes an authorization to obtain the required foreign exchange. The National Bank grants global import licenses for certain essential commodities and for limited amounts to individual firms in order to ensure their continuous operation; these are valid for three months (six months in the case of vehicle parts). Global licenses cannot cover both goods subject to the opening of a time deposit account and goods exempted from it. Licenses are examined at the National Bank to avoid overinvoicing. Any importer applying for a license must do so on the appropriate form and state that when paying for the imports he will not exceed the credit limit normally allowed under the regulations. Dealers in imported automobiles must be registered as such by the National Bank. Used automobiles can be imported only if they are less than three years old, and the importer has to assure the availability of spare parts. Imports whose f .o .b. value on the pro forma invoice is greater than RF 1.5 million in the case of ordinary licenses and RF 0.5 million in the case of global licenses are inspected by the SGS for quality and quantity in the ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution country of origin1 prior to shipment, and at the same time prices are verified. Import licenses must be pre- sented when the goods are cleared through customs, and a copy of the customs clearance form must be sent to the National Bank. For imports of products originating in member countries of the Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries (CEPGL), import licenses are replaced by CEPGL import notices. The Rwanda invest- ment code grants special concessions to enterprises under a contractual arrangement, which may imply exemption from import duties on certain types of equipment. Payments for Invisibles The prior approval of the National Bank is required for all payments for invisibles. Foreign exchange is sold by the National Bank, through the authorized banks, for (1) transport and other expenses (except insurance) connected with imports and exports; (2) transfers of the salaries or wages earned by foreign nationals employed in Rwanda under contract (net of taxes, net of the employee's share of social security contributions, and after deduction for other local expenses equivalent to 40 percent of net pay after tax, with a minimum of RF 50,000 a month and a limit of RF 70,000 a month for a head of household plus RF 20,000 a month for each dependent in Rwanda, whichever is higher); and (3) transfers of the net earned income of foreign nationals who are self-employed or engaged in a profes- sion or established as independent traders (also net of taxes and after deduction for local expenses). A fee of RF 750 is levied for a transfer authorization. Payments in respect of transport charges on imports cannot be made until imported goods have been cleared through customs (except in cases of payment by means of documentary credit payable on loading). Insurance on imports and exports must be taken out locally, with an insurance company constituted under Rwanda law. Net profits and dividends due to nonresidents may, in principle, be remitted abroad in fu l l, subject to the right of the National Bank to prescribe their transfer in installments. The purchase in domestic currency of tickets for travel abroad requires the prior approval of the National Bank. Authorizations for the purchase of foreign exchange for tickets and foreign exchange relating to travel for reasons of leisure, vacation, family, religion, conferences or sports are suspended until further notice. Travel for business and official purposes is restricted to the essen- tial m in imum, and foreign residents working in Rwanda are allowed only one airline ticket every two years, more than one trip being permissible only if the total cost of 'Except for imports from A fghan is tan, A lban ia, Bu rk ina Faso, Bu rund i, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, People's Re- public of China, Comoros, Djibouti, Gabon, Gu inea, Iraq, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Lao People's Democratic Repub l ic, Liberia, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Ma l i, Niger, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Syrian Arab Republic, Tanzania, Uganda, U .

Remittances for payments for certain other invisibles may be authorized on an ad hoc basis. Travelers may take out domestic bank notes up to RF 5,000. Residents require authorization by the Na- tional Bank to take out foreign bank notes. Nonresident travelers may take out any amount in foreign bank notes declared upon entry less the amount of their expenditures in Rwanda. Commercial banks are not permitted to export domestic bank notes. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to South Africa are prohibited. All exports, except trade samples, personal and household effects of travelers, and merchandise valued at less than RF 20,000, are subject to prior declaration. Declarations for all exports must be presented to the National Bank through an authorized bank for certification, for which a fee of RF 750 is levied. A declaration is valid for three months, but extensions may be granted by the National Bank, which also reserves the right to determine the conditions for certification. For exports to Burundi, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zaire, payment must be collected not later than 30 days after the goods have left the country; this deadline is not applicable to exports under CEPGL export notices, for which there is a quarterly clearing arrangement among the central banks. The maximum permissible period for repatriation of proceeds from exports to all other countries is 120 days. All exchange proceeds from exports must be surrendered to an authorized bank within 8 days from their collection. Proceeds from Invisibles All receipts from invisibles must be surrendered to the authorized banks within 8 days from their collection. The collection of claims resulting from services per- formed for nonresidents must take place within 30 days of the date on which the services are performed. Travelers may bring in up to RF 5,000 in domestic bank notes and any amount in foreign bank notes. All means of payment must be declared on entering Rwanda: Commercial banks are not permitted to import domestic bank notes. Capital All outward transfers of capital require the prior approval of the National Bank. Such approval is rarely given unless the transfer relates to a foreign investment in Rwanda that is covered by the Investment Law or to the personal effects of a foreign national returning to his own country. Retransfer guarantees are given by the National Bank in respect of short-term capital inflows remaining in Rwanda for at least two months. Outward transfer of proceeds from sales of real estate is sus- pended.

Not for Redistribution SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Sao Tome and Principe is the Sao Tome and Principe Dobra, which is pegged to the SDR at Db 45.25 = SDR 1. The middle rate quoted by the National Bank of Sao Tome and Principe (the central bank) for the dobra against the U.S. dollar, the interven- tion currency, is determined on the basis of the daily calculation of the U .S. dollar-SDR rate. Buying and selling rates for certain other currencies are also deter- mined on the basis of the Fund's daily calculations of the exchange rates of these currencies with respect to the SDR. Charges on purchases and sales of foreign exchange are influenced by the relatively high processing cost of transactions with the rest of the world, reflecting the limited communication facilities. Foreign exchange transactions are divided into three categories for the purposes of these charges—namely, import payments, transactions in foreign checks, and collection of export proceeds. (i) On import-related exchange transactions, the arrangements are as follows: on the opening of a letter of credit, a charge of 1.125 percent of the import value is payable, with an additional commission to the National Bank of 0.5 percent. A stamp duty of Db 2 per Db 1,000 of import value, plus a flat Db 50, is also payable, as well as a postage levy of Db 50. Any change in the letter of credit carries a further charge of Db 150. (ii) On foreign checks for collection, the National Bank applies a commission in favor of the collecting foreign correspondents, varying according to the particu- lar bank. In addition, the National Bank charges a postage levy of Db 20 for each transaction, together with a stamp duty of Db 15. In the period between payment of the import cost by the bank and receipt of funds from the importer, an interest rate of 6.5 percent per annum is charged on the loan. (iii) For collection of export proceeds, the National Bank charges a commission of 0.25 percent when opening the letter of credit and a further 0.125 percent when the funds are received. In addition, a postage levy of Db 500 is charged. Administration of Control All foreign exchange transactions are under the con- trol of the National Bank. The exchange controls are applied flexibly, and exceptions to the stated limits are permitted on an ad hoc basis. All foreign exchange proceeds must be surrendered to the National Bank, and all exchange payments must be made through that Bank. Import and export licenses are granted by the Directorate of External Commerce. Prescription of Currency The National Bank may prescribe the currency in which foreign exchange transactions shall be made. There are bilateral payments agreements w i th Cape Verde and the German Democratic Republic. Under the agreement with the German Democratic Republic, Sao Tome and Principe imports building supplies, equipment, and raw materials for the construc- tion and operation of the brewery and ceramics factory, as well as certain consumer goods, especially meat. The quantity of these goods to be imported is specified in annual protocols under the agreement. In return, Sao Tome and Principe is required to export to the German Democratic Republic a quantity of cocoa not below 1,500 tons each year. The agreement stipulates that the export price is to be established on the basis of the average world market price of 1980; however, if the world market price should subsequently rise above this level, a new contract would be negotiated. Transactions under the payments agreement with Cape Verde have normally covered Sao Tome and Principe's imports from Cape Verde, as well as receipts and payments for various services and transfers. The agree- ment provides for the central banks of the two countries to grant each other reciprocal noninterest credits of US$200,000; it also states that, should this balance be depleted and a debit balance persist for more than six months, the imbalance will be redressed by appropriate trade transactions between the two parties. Imports and Import Payments The state-owned foreign trading enterprise (EcoMEX), which has exclusive authority for most import activity, issues its own import licenses, but these must be approved by the National Bank. Exceptions to this exclusive authority are fuels and lubricants (imported by EMCO, the fuel enterprise), medications (imported by ENAMED, the pharmaceutical enterprise), and inputs for three foreign-financed projects. In these nonexclusive cases, import licenses must also be approved by the National Bank. For all imports, licenses are issued in accordance with Advance Import Registration Bulletins, which are valid for six months, but may be extended if necessary. The license specifies the quantity and the c . i .f. and f.o.b. values of the product to be imported, together with the currency of settlement. Licenses are granted under the annual import plan, taking into account the availability of foreign exchange and the country's supply and economic development require- ments. Prepayment for imports is permitted only through the opening of letters of credit. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles are approved within limits established by the National Bank. These limits, which allow for additional amounts in justifiable cases, include those on (1) transfers for medical treatment abroad when 427 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE local facilities are insufficient; (2) transfers of remit- tances to students; (3) transfers of savings from earnings when under technical cooperation agreements with the Government; and (4) transfers for payment of fares, freight, costs of communication with foreign countries, etc. Purchases of foreign exchange by residents for tourism are strictly limited, although air fares may be paid in domestic currency. Individual expenditures on airline tickets by private citizens for travel abroad are required not to exceed Db 40,000 in value over a three- year period. Transfers of profits by foreign companies established in Sao Tome* and Principe prior to indepen- dence have been suspended. There are no limitations on remittances for subscriptions to periodicals, books, etc., or on the payments of interest on external debt. Foreign exchange allowances for medical purposes are permitted up to Db 10,000 for a period of one month. Transfers of pension payments or social security pay- ments are also permitted for nonresident nationals who had been receiving such allowances by 1980. Payments for technical assistance and other services in the national interest are allowed. At the beginning of the school year a student may receive a special transfer of up to Db 5,000 a year for expenses related to courses taken abroad; additional amounts may be granted if approved by the Ministry of Education and Culture. All payments related to invisibles are subject to a stamp tax of 2 percent of value, or 4 percent if payment is made through a telegraphic transfer. A postage levy of Db 20 is payable on all transactions. Foreign travelers may take out in foreign exchange an amount not greater than the total sum declared upon entry. For this purpose, it is expected that the daily expenses of a tourist will not be less than Db 3,000. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports require an export license, as set out in Advance Export Registration Bulletins, which specify the quantity and c . i .f. or f .o .b. value of the export. All export proceeds must be received through the National Bank. The state-owned foreign trading enterprise (EcoMEX) is responsible for all export activity. Proceeds from Invisibles Travelers may bring in any amount of foreign exchange. Capital Inward foreign investments are governed by the Investment Code (Decree-Law No. 30/80, of August 5, 1980). Transfers are permitted for repayment of financ- ing under agreements with the Government and for the amortization of private sector investments in activities considered to be in the national interest. Personnel under technical assistance programs are allowed to transfer their savings in accordance with the terms of their contracts. Gold Exports and imports of gold require special authoriza- tion by the National Bank. Changes During 1984 Payments for Invisibles January 1. In a tightening of regulations on purchases of airline tickets by private citizens for travel abroad, the previous limit of Db 70,000 per year was changed to Db 40,000 over a three-year period. January 1. It was announced that the foreign exchange allowance for medical treatment abroad would be re- stricted to Db 10,000 for only a one-month period. (Previously, the purchase of foreign exchange for this purpose was .set at Db 20,000 in the first month and Db 10,000 in each of the ensuing two months; authoriza- tion for a further three-month period could also be given, if justified .) The change would apply to medical ex- penses incurred in any country, and not just in Portugal as was previously the case. 428 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SAUDI ARABIA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Saudi Arabia is the Saudi Arabian Riyal, which is pegged to the SDR at SRls 4.28255 = SDR 1. In principle, margins not exceeding 7.25 percent are allowed around the fixed relationship; these margins were suspended on July 22, 1981. The middle rate of the Saudi Arabian riyal for the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, quoted by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency is determined on the basis of the Fund's daily calculation of the U .S. dollar-SDR rate. On Decem- ber 31, 1984 the Monetary Agency's middle rate for the U.S. dollar was SRls 3.575; it sold U.S. dollars to banks at SRls 3.580 per US$1 and bought from banks and the principal producer of petroleum at SRls 3.570 per US$1; these rates served as the basis for exchange quotations in the market, the banks being permitted to charge up to 0.25 percent above and below the Monetary Agency's buying and selling rates. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Saudi Arabia formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agree- ment, as from March 22, 1961. Prescription of Currency The use of the currencies of Israel and South Africa is prohibited.l No other prescription of currency require- ments are in force. Imports and Import Payments Import licenses are not required, and exchange for payments abroad may be obtained freely. The importa- tion of a few commodities is prohibited for reasons of religion, health, or security; importation of certain other items in specified forms is also prohibited. Some imports are subject to customs duties at rates ranging between 4 percent and 20 percent; imports from member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) are exempted provided that at least 40 percent of the value added in each case is effected in GCC countries and that the capital of the producing firm is at least 51 percent owned by citizens of GCC member countries. Certain imports from Lebanon are subject to proof of origin requirements. Exports and Export Proceeds Export licenses are not required, and no control is exercised over export proceeds. The re-export of certain 1 In addition, all imports from these countries and all exports to these countries are prohibited; payments may not be made to them or be received from them for all types of transactions whether of a current or capital nature. imported items benefiting from government subsidy is prohibited. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments for and proceeds from invisibles are not restricted. Travelers may freely import and export Saudi Arabian bank notes and coin. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or payments by residents or nonresidents. The Monetary Agency has issued guidelines to its foreign correspondent banks requiring them to seek approval prior to the flotation of riyal-denominated loans. Local banks are prohibited from inviting foreign banks to participate in riyal-denominated syndicated transactions inside or outside Saudi Arabia without prior approval of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency. Prior approval by the Monetary Agency is also required for participation by local banks in either riyal-syndicated transactions arranged abroad or foreign-currency- syndicated transactions arranged for nonresidents. The Foreign Capital Investment Law provides for specified benefits to be extended to approved foreign investments in Saudi Arabia. Approved foreign capital enjoys the same privileges as domestic capital under the 1962 Law for the Protection and Promotion of National Industry. Foreign capital invested in industrial or agricultural projects with at least 25 percent Saudi Arabian partici- pation is exempt from income and corporate tax for ten years after production has begun. Borrowing from foreign banks is subject to a withholding tax on the repatriation of interest earnings. Gold The monetary authorities and all other residents, including private persons, may freely and without license purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad. They may also, without a license and without payment of any customs du ty or tax, import and export gold in any form, with the exception of 14-karat gold, the import of which is prohibited. Changes During 1984 Imports and Import Payments January 14. Under a cooperation agreement signed between Saudi Arabia and Iraq, trade in a number of industrial, agricultural, and livestock products became exempted from taxes and tariffs. February 8. An agreement covering cooperation in the field of economy and trade was signed between Saudi Arabia and Indonesia. October 27.

Not for Redistribution SENEGAL (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Senegal is the CFA Franc,l which is pegged to the French franc, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. The official buying and selling rates are CFAF 50 = F 1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market and the fixed rate between the French franc and the CFA franc. The BCEAO levies a commission of 0.10 per mill for transfers from countries outside the West African Mone- tary Union and one of 2.50 per mill for transfers to such countries.2 An exchange commission of 0.125-1.0 per mill, depending on the amount, is charged by the banks on purchases or sales of foreign exchange other than those directly related to external transactions. In addi- tion, they levy a commission on transfers to all countries outside the West African Monetary Union, 72 percent of which must be surrendered to the Treasury through the Central Bank. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of measures relating to gold and the repatriation of export proceeds, Senegal's exchange controls do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Directorate of Money and Credit in the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Part of the approval authority in respect of exchange control has been delegated to the BCEAO and to authorized banks. The BCEAO is authorized to collect, either directly or through the banks, other financial institutions, the Postal Administration, and notaries public, any information necessary to compile balance of payments statistics. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through authorized banks, the Postal Administration, or the BCEAO. Export authorizations and prior import authori- zations are issued for listed products by the Ministry of Commerce. !The CFA franc is issued by the Banque Centrale des Etats de FAfrique de 1'Ouest (BCEAO) and is the common currency in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo. 2 Transfers between member countries of the Union are subject to a minimum flat commission of CFAF 100 levied on settlements between agencies of the BCEAO. Prescription of Currency Since Senegal is an Operations Account country, settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other Operations Account country. Current transactions with The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are normally settled through the West African Clearing House. Set- tlements with all other countries are usually effected through correspondent banks in France, in any of the currencies of those countries, or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. All settlements with South Africa are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. The crediting to nonresident accounts of CFA bank notes, French bank notes, or bank notes issued by any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account is not permitted, except for BCEAO bank notes mailed to the BCEAO agency in Dakar by an authorized bank's foreign correspondent; such bank notes may be credited to a Foreign Account in Francs opened by the latter with an authorized bank in Senegal. Foreign Accounts in Francs may be debited, without prior authorization, with the value of BCEAO bank notes mailed by authorized intermediaries directly to their foreign correspondents. Imports and Import Payments Imports originating in or proceeding from South Africa are prohibited, and the import of certain goods is prohibited from all countries except member states of the West African Economic Community. The import from any source of a number of other commodities is subject to prior authorization. Imports from countries in the French Franc Area are generally free of license and quantitative restriction; some goods, although free from import license, require prior authorization by the Minis- try of Economy and Finance. Imports of virtually all goods from EC countries (the six original member states) and imports of some goods from all countries of the former Organization for European Economic Coopera- tion (OEEC), the United States, and Canada are free of quantitative restriction; such liberalized imports require only an import certificate made out by the importer himself. Imports of certain goods from countries outside the EC, the French Franc Area, or the West African Economic Community are subject to prior authorization. All import transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value exceeds CFAF 100,000 (delivered at the Senegal- ese border or c . i . f . ). The exchange authorizations entitle 431 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SENEGAL importers to purchase the necessary exchange, but not earlier than eight days before shipment if a documentary credit is opened or the due date for settlement if the commodities have already been imported (if no docu- mentary credit has been opened, on presentation of the bill of lading). Furthermore, payments for imports may not be made prior to customs clearance. Payments for Invisibles All payments to South Africa are prohibited. Pay- ments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to approval. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Autho- rized intermediary banks are empowered to effect any payment abroad up to CFAF 20,000 on behalf of residents without requiring documents. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted. For tourist travel, residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may obtain an exchange allocation equivalent to CFAF 200,000 a year for each person (CFAF 100,000 for children under ten); any foreign exchange remaining after return to Senegal must be surrendered. Applications for additional amounts of foreign exchange may also be approved. For business travel, there is a special allocation of the equivalent of CFAF 20,000 a day, subject to a maximum of CFAF 300,000 a person a trip, but not more than the equivalent of CFAF 20,000 in BCEAO bank notes or its equivalent in currency notes issued by the Bank of France or a bank of issue linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account may be taken. The transfer of the full net salary of a foreigner working in Senegal is permitted upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher, provided that the transfer takes place within three months following the pay period; however, for Mauritanian nationals working in Senegal the trans- ferable portion is limited to 50 percent or 80 percent, depending on family status and residence, except for leave salaries, which are transferable in fu l l. Resident and nonresident travelers to foreign countries may take out, in addition to any foreign exchange allocation, up to CFAF 20,000 in BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, and bank notes of other Operations Account countries. Resident travelers to other countries of the French Franc Area may take out any amount in BCEAO bank notes, bu t, if proceeding to a country that is not a member of the West African Monetary Union, they must declare to the customs the amount taken out if it exceeds CFAF 200,000. Nonresident travelers may freely take out any means of payment, such as traveler's checks, issued abroad in their name. However, the export of foreign bank notes in amounts in excess of the equivalent of CFAF 50,000 is 432 authorized only up to the amount declared by them on entry (m inus sales of foreign exchange in Senegal and plus any repurchases up to CFAF 50,000). Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. With a few exceptions (e .g ., gold, diamonds, tuna f ish), exports to countries in the French Franc Area are free of prior authorization. Most exports to other countries require authorization mainly in order to assure adequate supplies for domestic needs and to prevent certain re-exports. Certain nontraditional exports are eligible for an export subsidy equivalent to 15 percent of f .o .b. value, de- signed to promote exports to nonmember countries of the Economic Community of West Africa. The scheme covers agricultural equipment, canned f ish, fertilizers, shoes, textiles, and products in excess supply on the domestic market or for which output could easily be increased. Proceeds from exports to foreign countries, including countries of the French Franc Area, must normally be collected within 120 days of the arrival of the goods at their destination and repatriated not later than one month after the due date. All export transac- tions exceeding CFAF 500,000 must be domiciled with an authorized intermediary bank. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Ac- count countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services, and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets, must be collected and surrendered, if received in foreign currency, within one month of the due date or the date of receipt. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BCEAO, the Bank of France, or any bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) of countries outside the French Franc Area; residents bringing in foreign bank notes must declare them to the customs upon entry and sell them to an authorized bank within eight days. Capital All settlements between Senegal and South Africa are prohibited. Capital movements between Senegal and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require approval by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. Controls are maintained over borrowing abroad, over inward direct investment and all outward investment, and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Senegal. Such operations require prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. Exempt from authorization, however, are oper- ations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution from the Senegalese Government and (2) shares that are identical w i th, or may be substituted for, securities whose issue, offering, or sale in Senegal has previously been authorized. With the exception of controls over foreign securities, these measures do not apply to France, Monaco, member countries of the West African Monetary Union, and the Operations Account countries. Special controls are maintained also over imports and exports of gold, over the soliciting of funds for deposit with foreign private persons and foreign firms and institutions, and over publicity aimed at placing funds abroad or at subscribing to real estate and building operations abroad; these special controls also apply to France, Monaco, and the Operations Account countries. All investments abroad by residents of Senegal require prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance;3 75 percent of such investments must be financed with borrowing abroad. Foreign direct invest- ments in Senegal4 must be declared to the Minister of Economy and Finance before such investments are made. The Minister has a period of two months from receipt of the declaration, during which he may request postponement of the project. Both the making and the liquidating of direct and other investments, whether these are Senegalese investments abroad or foreign investments in Senegal, must be reported to the Minister and the BCEAO within 20 days following each opera- tion. Direct investments constitute investments implying control of a company or enterprise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. Lending abroad requires prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. Borrowing by residents from nonresidents requires prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and 3 Including investments made through foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in Senegal and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Senegal. 4 Including those made by companies in Senegal which are directly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in Senegal of foreign companies. SENEGAL Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) borrowings constituting a direct invest- ment, which are subject to prior declaration, as indicated above; (2) borrowings contracted by authorized banks; (3) borrowings other than those mentioned above, subject to certain conditions, when their total amount outstanding, including the new borrowing, does not exceed CFAF 40 million. The repayment of borrowings not constituting a direct investment requires the special authorization of the Minister of Economy and Finance if the borrowing itself was subject to such approval, but is exempt if it was exempt from special authorization. The Investment Code provides various facilities and benefits for approved foreign investments in Senegal. There are special facilities for export industries estab- lished in the Dakar export-processing zone. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Senegal. Imports and exports of gold from or to any other country require prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports and exports by the Treasury or the BCEAO; (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles); and (3) imports and exports by travelers of gold articles up to a combined weight of 200 grams. Brokers in precious metals require an authorization from the Minister of Economy and Finance to conduct their business. Imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Purchases abroad of nonmonetary gold are subject to a tax of 25 percent. Commercial imports of gold jewelry require prior authorization by the Minister of Commerce, and imports of ornaments require the prior advice of the Senegal Corporation for the Promotion of Art Handi- crafts (Societe Senegalaise pour la Promotion de 1'Ar- tisanat d'Art) and the Directorate of Mines and Geology. Changes During 1984 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 433 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SEYCHELLES (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Seychelles is the Seychelles Rupee, which is pegged to the SDR at SR 7.2345 = SDR 1. The official buying and selling rates for the pound sterling, the intervention currency, are determined on the basis of the daily calculation of the pound sterling-SDR rate on the previous business day .l On December 31, 1984 the buying and selling rates of the Central Bank of the Seychelles for the pound sterling were SR 8.5957 and SR 8.6818, respectively, per £ stg. 1. The Central Bank charges a commission of 0.125 percent for buying and 0.875 percent for selling of pounds sterling and U.S. dollars. The commercial banks are authorized to deal in pounds sterling and other currencies at rates based on the daily calculations of SDR rates for the respective currencies. These rates are circulated daily to the commercial banks by the Central Bank. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Seychelles formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from January 3, 1978. Administration of Control and Prescription of Currency There is no exchange control, and there are no prescription of currency requirements. The Seychelles Marketing Board exercises controls on foreign trade and domestic marketing; the Import Division of the Board performs regulatory roles previously handled by the Seychelles National Commodity Corporation (SEYCOM). Imports and Import Payments2 No restrictions are placed on payments for imports, except where goods imported from South Africa are concerned. With this exception, most goods may be imported freely from any source under open general license. Payments for such transactions may be effected without the completion of application forms. A number of imports, including motor vehicles, require a specific license, and the import of a few items is prohibited. Most imports are subject to duties, with a preferential schedule of rates applying to goods originating in Common- wealth, ACP, and EC countries. Beginning from February 1, 1985, exchange rates for various currencies (including the pound sterling, the intervention currency) are quoted on the basis of their New York closing rates for the U.S. dollar on the previous day, using the U.S. dollar rate for the Seychelles rupee as derived from the fixed parity to the SDR. 2 On February 1, 1985, a system was introduced under which importers are required to obtain import licenses from a newly established Seychelles Licensing Authority and to apply for import permits from the Import Control section of the Seychelles Marketing Board. 434 Payments for Invisibles There are no restrictions on payments for invisibles, and no limits are imposed on the provision of travel exchange. Travelers may take or send out of Seychelles any amount of domestic or foreign currency. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports normally do not require licenses. Residents may export goods without exchange control formality to any country, except South Africa. Export proceeds need not be repatriated or surrendered. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles may be disposed of freely. Overseas visitors may bring in any amount of currency for travel expenditure. Capital No restrictions are imposed on inward or outward capital payments. Outward transfers of overseas-owned capital are allowed without limit. Whether or not they have been granted temporary residential status, non- nationals are permitted to repatriate their surplus earn- ings without limit. New investment outside Seychelles by permanent residents and by companies and other organizations operating in Seychelles is not subject to any limitation. Foreign investment (whether portfolio, direct invest- ment, increased investment in existing entities in the form of loans, or equity capital) is free of restrictions. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad, but dealings in gold bullion are restricted to authorized dealers. Two commemorative gold coins in denominations of SR 1,500 and SR 1,000 have been issued and are legal tender. Another gold coin in denomination of SR 20 issued in December 1983 in commemoration of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the Central Bank is also legal tender, and a fourth issue (in denomination of SR 25) was made in April 1984 to mark the World Fisheries Conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Changes During 1984 Administration of Control August 28. Legislation was enacted, establishing the Seychelles Marketing Board to exercise control on exports, imports, and domestic marketing. The activities of the Board were to include those previously performed by the Seychelles National Commodity Corporation. October 15.

Not for Redistribution SIERRA LEONE (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement1 The currency of Sierra Leone is the Sierra Leonean Leone which is pegged to the U.S. dollar at Le 1 = US$0.40. On December 31, 1984 the Bank of Sierra Leone's buying and selling rates in the official market were US$0.4000 and US$0.39688, respectively, per Le 1. The Bank of Sierra Leone deals at the official market rate only in pounds sterling and in the U .S. dollar; daily rates for the pound sterling are determined on the basis of the U .S. dollar-pound sterling rate, subject to a maximum commission of 1 percent on the selling side only. Rates for other currencies are deter- mined on the basis of the U .S. dollar rates for the respective currencies in the London market. Beginning from August 1984, a reconstituted Foreign Exchange Allocation Committee, with His Excellency the Pres- ident as Chairman, is solely responsible for the alloca- tion of foreign exchange2 for imports. Administration of Control Exchange control policy is determined by the Ministry of Finance, in consultation with the Bank of Sierra Leone, but the day-to-day administration of exchange control is carried out by the Bank of Sierra Leone with the assistance of the commercial banks. Import and export licenses are issued by the Ministry of Trade and Industry within the framework of the foreign exchange budget. Authorized dealers may sell foreign exchange for licensed imports and for travel expenses within specified limits. Prescription of Currency Transactions with all countries are subject to exchange control. Certain settlements with the People's Republic of China must be channeled through clearing accounts established under the terms of a bilateral payments agreement. Payments for imports from other countries may be made in leones to the credit of an External Account, in the currency of the exporting country, in pounds sterling, or in U .S. dollars. Settlements with the Central Bank of West African States (for Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Niger, Senegal, and Togo) and The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, 1 As part of their adjustment efforts, the Sierra Leonean authorities, with effect from February 21, 1985, changed the exchange rate of the leone to Le 6.0 = US$1, and switched the peg for the leone from the U .S. dollar to the SDR. 2Previously, in March 1984, a Foreign Exchange Allocation Committee which, assisted by a technical subcommittee, supervised the allocation of foreign exchange within the framework of an annual foreign exchange budget, was modified to provide incentives to exporters to surrender their foreign exchange; exporters of gold and diamonds were permitted to utilize their export proceeds for the importation of approved commodities or sell all or part of such foreign exchange to other importers at rates freely determined between the two parties. 436 Mauritania, and Nigeria are normally made through the West African Clearing House. Receipts from exports other than diamonds to countries other than the People's Republic of China may be obtained in leones from an External Account, in the currency of the importing country, or in any specified currency.3 Receipts from all exports must be obtained in the currency of the importing country or in any other specified currency, and surren- dered through the banking system of Sierra Leone. Nonresident Accounts Accounts in leones held with authorized banks in Sierra Leone by residents of countries outside Sierra Leone are designated External Accounts. In addition, there are Blocked Accounts, to which are credited amounts due to nonresidents that may not be remitted abroad. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Namibia and South Africa are prohibited. In addition there is a list of prohibited luxury import items, including cars, radios, televisions, cameras, washing machines, and certain food products. All other imports are subject to specific import licenses which are issued within the annual foreign exchange budget on the basis of quarterly import programs. Priority in licensing is given to essential items, such as rice, sugar, essential foods, raw materials, and spare parts. Import orders may be placed only after receipt of import licenses and foreign exchange approval. All imports must be made against letters of credit with local commercial banks or after receipts of foreign exchange on terms and conditions determined by the Foreign Exchange Allocation Committee. There are outstanding arrears on import payments. All imports not specifically exempted by the Minister of Finance are subject to an invoice entry fee and to an import licensing fee, both equal to 12 percent of the c . i . f. value and payable at the time of importation; the rate for imports from countries belonging to the Eco- nomic Community of West African States is 5 percent. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to nonresidents are made from commercial banks' working balances on approval by the Bank of Sierra Leone. With appropriate documentation, foreign exchange for such purchases as the basic travel allowance of up to US$1,000 a year may be purchased directly from authorized dealers. Remittances of earn- ings by foreign nationals are limited, in principle, to 3 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, CFA francs, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and U .S. dollars. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution US$6,500 or 40 percent of net taxable annual wages and salaries, whichever is lower, but the Bank of Sierra Leone may permit the transfer of larger amounts. Insurance on imported goods must be taken out with insurance companies incorporated in Sierra Leone. The buying commission for agents abroad is not normally permitted to exceed 3 percent, and bank charges, financing commission, and other financial charges on imports also are not normally allowed. There are arrears on payments for current invisibles, including interest on official debt. For travel abroad, residents are entitled to a basic exchange allowance of US$1,000 a person a calendar year. Applications for larger amounts are considered on an individual basis. In addition to the basic exchange allowance, travelers may take out, regardless of destina- tion, Le 20 in leone notes and the equivalent of Le 50 in foreign currency notes. Nonresident travelers may take out any foreign currency bank notes, including sterling notes, declared by them when entering Sierra Leone. Travel abroad is subject to a travel tax of 10 percent of the price of the ticket, payable at the time of purchase of the ticket. Exports and Export Proceeds With the exception of some commodities, the exporta- tion of which is restricted to certain state corporations, export licenses are granted by the Ministry of Trade and Industry for the export of all commodities to all countries except Namibia and South Africa. The proceeds of exports, including diamonds and other minerals, must be received in the currency of the importing country or in any other specified currency agreed to by the Bank of Sierra Leone; the proceeds must be received by the exporter and sold to an authorized bank in Sierra Leone or the Bank of Sierra Leone within 30 days from the date of export, or 60 days for diamonds and 45 days for coffee and cocoa, unless permission to do otherwise is obtained. The buying and exporting of diamonds is carried out by locally licensed firms and by several foreign companies. In addition to the Bank of Sierra Leone, gold may be exported by licensed private exporters, who are, however, required to buy domestic gold only from licensed miners or dealers. Proceeds from specified traditional exports must be surrendered to the Bank of Sierra Leone; proceeds from all other exports may be surrendered either to the Bank of Sierra Leone or any authorized bank in Sierra Leone. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in specified currencies (see footnote 3) must be offered for sale to an authorized bank within 30 days. Subject to declaration upon entry, persons entering Sierra Leone may bring in any amount of foreign bank notes. The importation of domestic bank notes is limited to Le 20 for each traveler. Capital Capital payments to nonresidents of Sierra Leone are subject to exchange control. Residents of Sierra Leone SIERRA LEONE require permission from the Bank of Sierra Leone to purchase foreign currency securities or real estate situated abroad. Investments by nonresidents may be repatriated at any time, together with profits, subject to foreign exchange availability and provided that exchange control permission was obtained initially for the invest- ment. The Sierra Leone Exchange Control Act of 1954 imposes control on the issue and transfer of securities. The placing of an issue in Sierra Leone requires permission if either the person acquiring the securities or the person for whom he is nominee is resident outside Sierra Leone. Permission must also be obtained before a security registered in Sierra Leone may be transferred to a nonresident. Capital in respect of securities registered in Sierra Leone may not be transferred abroad without permission. Where permission has been given for securi- ties registered in Sierra Leone to be sold to persons resident abroad, the company is usually required to obtain bank certification of the funds brought into Sierra Leone. The Development Ordinance of 1960 and the Development of Industries Act, 1983 provide for income tax and customs duty concessions to foreign and domes- tic companies undertaking industrial or agricultural activities that are needed for the development of the country. Noncitizens are prohibited from owning or controlling certain types of business. Residents of Sierra Leone must sell their foreign exchange holdings to an authorized dealer. Exemption is granted for authorized dealers, diplomats, and holders of sterling assets held prior to June 24, 1972 for which exemption has been claimed and granted by the Bank of Sierra Leone. Exempted securities may be sold outside the former Sterling Area and any income therefrom may be retained in the former Sterling Area or reinvested in other Sterling Area securities. Any certificate of securi- ties purchased with the proceeds of the sale of securities exempted under this permission is exempt from deposit requirements. Any assets held outside the former Ster- ling Area by any foreign national temporarily resident in Sierra Leone also are exempt from surrender and deposit requirements, provided that exemption has been claimed and granted by an authorized dealer or by the Bank of Sierra Leone. Holdings of working balances in foreign exchange by commercial banks are subject to ceilings; foreign ex- change inflows above the permitted limits must be surrendered to the Bank of Sierra Leone. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in Sierra Leone for numismatic purposes. Also, residents and nonresidents may freely purchase, hold, sell, or export certain Sierra Leonean commemorative gold coins. With these exceptions, licenses are required for purchases and sales of gold in any form other than jewelry; residents must declare and make available to the Government gold held in the form of bars or coin. 437 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SIERRA LEONE Imports of gold in any form other than jewelry constitut- ing the personal effects of a traveler require individual import licenses, which are not normally granted. Travel- ers do not require a license to take out personal jewelry if the value of the total gold and platinum content does not exceed Le 200. Exports of unworked gold are not subject to export tax. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement March 1. The existing exchange arrangement was modified, such that exporters of gold and diamonds, while continuing to be formally required to surrender their foreign exchange proceeds at the official rate, were allowed to do so with the understanding that the funds could be resold to them at the official rate for the importation of approved commodities; alternatively, they could sell all or part of such foreign exchange to other importers at rates freely determined between the two parties. August 16. The Foreign Exchange Allocation Com- mittee was reconstituted into the Foreign Exchange Committee under the Chairmanship of His Excellency the President. The new committee was solely responsible for allocating foreign exchange for imports. In addition, the practice of sometimes allowing importation of goods without prior license from the Ministry of Trade and Industry was discontinued. Exports and Export Proceeds February 23. The Bank of Sierra Leone's monopoly over the export of gold was terminated, and it was announced that licenses would be granted to private exporters, who were expected to buy only from licensed miners or dealers. 438 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SINGAPORE (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Singapore is the Singapore Dollar. The value of the Singapore dollar is determined on the basis of its fixed relationship to a trade-weighted basket of currencies representing Singapore's major trading partners. The exchange rate of the Singapore dollar in terms of the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is determined in the foreign exchange market. The buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar on December 31, 1984 were S$2.1775 and S$2.1785, respectively, per US$1. Rates for other currencies are established on the basis of the daily rate for the U.S. dollar and their cross rates in international markets. Banks are free to deal spot and forward in all currencies. Singapore and Brunei currency notes and coins are freely interchangeable, at par and without charge, in Singapore and Brunei. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Foreign currency futures are traded at the Singapore International Monetary Exchange. Singapore formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from November 9, 1968. Administration of Control There are no exchange control formalities but the Monetary Authority of Singapore retains responsibility for exchange control matters. The Trade Development Board under the Ministry of Trade and Industry adminis- ters and registers imports and exports. Prescription of Currency There are no prescription of currency requirements. Nonresident Accounts There is no distinction between accounts of residents and nonresidents of Singapore. Debits and credits to all accounts may be made freely. Imports and Import Payments Virtually all imports are permitted freely. A few imports are controlled for health, safety, or security reasons. All imports originating in South Africa or any territory administered by it are prohibited. Import licenses are required for the following items, irrespective of origin: (1) rice, refined sugar, air-conditioning ma- chines not exceeding 9,000 kcal/h (excluding air-condi- tioning machines for motor vehicles); and (2) all goods originating in or consigned from Albania, the German Democratic Republic, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Mongolia, and Viet Nam. License applica- tions for goods under the second category are subject to a surcharge of 0.5 percent of the c .i .f. value of imports, payable to the Government. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles may be made freely. There are no restrictions on the amount of foreign exchange made available for travel abroad. Remittances to nonres- idents of dividends, interest, and profits may be made freely. Resident and nonresident travelers may take out any amount in foreign or Singapore bank notes. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of certain textiles and garments of Singapore origin to countries of the European Community, Austria, Canada, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and the United States are subject to quantitative restriction in the importing countries. Export licenses are required for refined sugar, reinforcement bars (6 millimeters to 32 millimeters), granite, sand, timber, and rubber. Export proceeds need not be surrendered and may be disposed of freely. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles need not be surren- dered and may be disposed of freely. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount in foreign bank notes and coin, including Singapore gold coin. Capital There are no restrictions on capital transfers. Govern- ment approval is required for investment in residential and other properties (including vacant land) other than those zoned or approved for industrial or commercial use. A foreigner may, however, freely purchase a residential unit within a building of six or more stories and in an approved condominium development without such approval. With regard to other residential proper- ties, foreigners who make an economic contribution to Singapore will be given favorable consideration for purchase of these properties for their own occupation and, in the case of foreign companies, for the accommo- dation of their senior personnel. Banks in Singapore may freely accept deposits in foreign currencies. Financial institutions that have been approved to operate Asian Currency Units (ACUs) in Singapore are able to offer better rates for foreign currency deposits placed with their ACUs because of the absence of minimum cash reserve and liquidity require- ments. An ACU is a separate accounting entity of a financial institution, which enjoys a concessionary rate of tax of 10 percent on its income; it is prohibited from transacting in Singapore dollars. All income earned from offshore loan syndications in Singapore is exempt from tax under the tax holiday scheme for syndicated offshore loans which came into effect in April 1983. Under the scheme, income earned by ACUs in Singapore would be exempt from tax 439 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SINGAPORE provided that: (a) the entity serving as lead manager is an ACU in Singapore (in the case of two or more lead managers, at least one half of the number must be financial institutions in Singapore), (b) the syndication work is carried out substantially in Singapore, (c) there are at least three parties participating in the syndicate, and (d) the facility is syndicated for a party outside Singapore. The scheme has been extended since April 1984 to cover the syndication of other credit facilities, such as guarantees, performance bonds, letters of credit, and underwriting facilities. Income earned by nonresidents on funds placed by them with approved fund managers (which are ACUs) in Singapore for investment in offshore markets is exempt from tax under the tax exemption scheme for offshore fund management which came into effect in May 1983. Management fees of the fund managers are taxed at the concessionary rate of 10 percent. Gold There is a free gold market in Singapore. Both resident and nonresident individuals and companies are permitted to import, hold, negotiate, and export gold freely; imports and exports require neither exchange control approval nor import or export licenses, and gold can be dealt with freely by any person in Singapore. There are two distinct gold markets: the physical market and the futures market. The delivery point for the physical market is in London, with appropriate price adjustments for the cost of transportation and insurance. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement September 7. Trading in Eurodollar time deposit interest rate and currency futures contracts of deutsche mark against U .S. dollars commenced at the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX). The two types of contracts were to be traded under the mutual offset arrangement with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. November 6. Trading in currency futures contracts of Japanese yen against U .S. dollars commenced at the SIMEX. Such contracts were also to be traded under the mutual offset arrangement with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Gold July 5.

Not for Redistribution SOLOMON ISLANDS (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Solomon Islands is the Solomon Islands Dollar, issued by the Central Bank of Solomon Islands. The exchange rate for the Solomon Islands dollar is determined on the basis of a relationship between the Solomon Islands dollar and a trade-weighted basket of the currencies of Solomon Islands' four major trading partners. The Central Bank may make discretion- ary adjustments in the exchange value of the Solomon Islands dollar, up to a total of 2 percent during any four- week period. Daily quotations for the four currencies in the basket (the pound sterling, the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar, and the U.S. dollar), as well as for the deutsche mark and the SDR, are provided by the Central Bank, which also sets limits on the buying and selling rates of commercial banks for the U .S. dollar. On December 31, 1984 the buying and selling rates quoted by the banks in their dealings with the public were US$0.7467 and US$0.7419, respectively, per SI$1. The commercial banks in Solomon Islands are free to determine their exchange rates for all other foreign currencies. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Solomon Islands formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund's Articles of Agreement on July 24, 1979. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Central Bank by means of the Exchange Control (Foreign Exchange) Regulations, which came into force on March 1, 1977. The Central Bank delegates extensive powers to com- mercial banks, which have been appointed authorized dealers in foreign exchange. The authorized dealers may approve certain types of application for exchange control approval up to specified limits. All persons residing in Solomon Islands are regarded as permanent residents for exchange control purposes, unless they have been granted temporary resident status by an authorized dealer or by the Central Bank. Applications for temporary resident status are normally approved if the person is a citizen of a foreign country who intends to reside in Solomon Islands for a period of less than four years or has resided in Solomon Islands for over four years but who can produce evidence of firm intention to resume permanent residence overseas in the near future. Ownership of real property (other than dwellings for own occupation) or a business indicates permanent residential status, regardless of the duration of residence in Solomon Islands. However, temporary resident status does not release a person from the obligation to comply with all provisions of the exchange control regulations. Prescription of Currency Contractual commitments to persons resident outside Solomon Islands, which are expressed in a foreign currency, may only be met by payments in that foreign currency. Export proceeds may be received in any foreign currency or in Solomon Islands dollars from an account of an overseas bank with a bank in Solomon Islands. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents may open nonresident accounts in Sol- omon Islands dollars with authorized dealers, but ap- proval from the Central Bank or authorized dealers is required for the crediting of these accounts. Balances on such accounts may be transferred abroad with the approval of the Central Bank or authorized dealers. Imports and Import Payments No restrictions are placed on payments for imports, provided that it can be shown that they are properly due overseas. Authorized dealers are permitted to approve most transactions without reference to the Central Bank. Payments for Invisibles Approval is readily given for payments for services and remittances of dividends, profits, and other earnings accruing to overseas residents from companies in Sol- omon Islands, provided that it can be shown that they are properly due overseas. Permanent residents are per- mitted to purchase foreign exchange for payment of all types of invisibles if supporting documents are provided. Transfers by postal order to persons residing perma- nently outside Solomon Islands are permitted, provided that the total amount transferred does not exceed SI$100 a week. Approval is normally given for the purchase of foreign currency for travel purposes. Applications for travel funds must be lodged with an authorized dealer, and applicants are required to present their passports and passage or flight tickets. Requests for unusually large amounts of foreign exchange are referred to the Central Bank. Travelers may not take out Solomon Islands currency notes and coin, in excess of SI$250, without the approval of the Central Bank, which is not normally given. Exports and Export Proceeds Residents may export goods without exchange control formality provided that they comply with the terms of the General Authority issued by the Central Bank. The essential conditions of this General Authority are that payment for goods exported is received within six months before or after the date of export, that the export price is reasonable, and that the proceeds are sold to an authorized dealer. Where exporters are not in a position 441 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SOLOMON ISLANDS to comply with the conditions of the General Authority, they must apply to the Central Bank for a Specific Authority. Authority is not needed for goods under SI$250 in value in any one consignment or for certain exempted categories of goods, including most kinds of personal effects of passengers. Proceeds from Invisibles Approval is required for the disposal of foreign currency proceeds other than by means of a sale to an authorized dealer. Overseas residents visiting Solomon Islands may bring in any amount of currency for travel expenditure. Capital All outward transfers of capital require exchange control approval. All applications for transfers must be referred to the Central Bank. Approval is readily given for the withdrawal of nonresident-owned investment capital, repayment of overseas borrowings, and the remittance of temporary residents' and emigrants' funds. New investment abroad by permanent residents or by companies and other organizations operating in Solomon Islands is subject to certain limitations. Direct invest- ment overseas is permitted when it is likely to be of benefit to Solomon Islands. In the case of portfolio investments, the approval of the Central Bank is needed prior to the acquisition or disposal of foreign securities by a permanent resident. Approval is normally not given for the acquisition of overseas portfolio investments. Restrictions are not normally imposed on the disposal of foreign securities acquired prior to March 1, 1977. Approval by the Central Bank is required for a resident to borrow funds from or to issue equity capital to a nonresident. The Solomon Islands branch of a com- pany or firm incorporated overseas requires approval by the Central Bank before it may borrow funds from a nonresident, including the branch's overseas head office. Where initial or increased foreign investment is con- cerned, the Foreign Investment Board in the Prime Minister's Office must also give its approval. Gold Solomon Islanders alone are granted a license to pan for alluvial gold. Commercial banks and all other residents are required to obtain a permit issued by the Ministry of Natural Resources to mine, buy, or export gold. The Central Bank is authorized to buy, sell, and hold gold but has not yet undertaken any such transactions. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement January 2. Following the floating of the Australian dollar in December 1983, the Central Bank of Solomon Islands ceased quoting to the banks the exchange rate of the Solomon Islands dollar in terms of the Australian dollar. 442 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SOMALIA1 (Position on January 1, 1985) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Somalia is the Somali Shilling. Somalia's exchange arrangement consists of two ex- change markets, the official market and the free market. In the official market, the exchange rate is adjusted periodically by the Central Bank largely on the basis of relative price movements in Somalia and abroad. On January 1, 1985 the official buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, were, respec- tively, So. Sh. 35.64 = US$1 and So. Sh. 36.36 = US$1. The Central Bank of Somalia carries out transac- tions in certain other "convertible" currencies,2 taking into account rates in European exchange markets. The official exchange market in Somalia comprises the Central Bank and the sole commercial bank operating as the authorized dealer of the Central Bank in respect of transactions in foreign currencies. On the receipt side, the official rate applies to the surrendered portion of export proceeds, official loans, grants and investment income, and foreign exchange receipts of embassies and international organizations; and on the payment side, it applies to central government imports, official travel, expenses of Somali embassies abroad, imports of crude petroleum and petroleum products, and the operational costs of the Central Bank. All other transactions are conducted in the free market. Exchange transactions in the free market take place through foreign-currency- denominated external export-promoting and import ac- counts. The commercial bank, operating on account of the Central Bank or on its own account, may also operate in the free market at the prevailing market rate, which is defined as the weighted average exchange rate for transactions through foreign currency accounts during the previous business day. The commercial bank does not conduct forward exchange transactions on behalf of the public, although this is not prohibited. Administration of Control The Ministry of Commerce is the principal govern- ment agency concerned with the implementation and operation of trade controls. Exchange controls are administered by the Central Bank. Prescription of Currency Settlements with the U .S .S .R. are made through bilateral clearing accounts denominated in pounds ster- ling. Settlements with all other countries must be made in Somali shillings or in "convertible" currencies (in- 1 As Somalia undertook a major reform of its exchange and trade system with effect from January 1, 1985, this description is based on the new system in place as of that date. 2Deutsche mark, Djibouti francs, French francs, Italian lire, Kuwaiti dinars, pounds sterling, Saudi Arabian riyals, Swiss francs, and U .A .E. dirhams. eluding the U.S. dollar, see footnote 2); however, residents are not permitted to make settlements with Israel or South Africa. Nonresident and Foreign Currency Accounts Nonresident accounts in Somali shillings may be opened with the authorized exchange dealer by foreign nationals and foreign institutions having diplomatic status in Somalia, and by foreign companies engaged in mineral prospecting or consultancy services. External accounts in U.S. dollars may be opened by both residents and nonresidents. Such accounts may be credited with foreign exchange transferred from abroad and may be debited for any external payment and for transfers to other external accounts. Exporters of goods and services may deposit up to 65 percent of their foreign exchange proceeds from exports in export-promoting accounts. Funds in such accounts may be used for merchandise import payments, invisible payments within existing regulations, or be deposited in an import account. Import accounts in foreign exchange may be opened by both residents and nonresidents and credited from export-promoting ac- counts, external accounts, or from transfers of foreign exchange from abroad. Foreign exchange in these accounts may be used for merchandise import payments, invisible payments within existing regulations, or for transfers into other import accounts. Imports and Import Payments Imports of goods originating in or shipped from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Imports of alcohol, tobacco, and tobacco products, crude oil and petroleum products, medical and pharmaceutical products, explo- sives, precious metals and jewelry, and minerals are subject to prior approval. All other items, with the exception of items prohibited for reasons of public safety and social policy, can be imported freely. The state- trading organization, the National Agency for Trade (ENC), is responsible for the import and distribution of certain commodities received under aid programs. The Iraqi-Somali Oil Refinery is responsible for the import of crude petroleum, while the National Petroleum Agency is the only importer of other fuels and fuel products. Private importers may open letters of credit for imports at the commercial bank on the basis of foreign exchange made available for that purpose through a foreign currency account with the commercial bank; in such a case the foreign exchange involved is kept in a suspense account until the time of settlement of the letter of credit. Alternatively, the commercial bank may sell foreign exchange to private importers at the prevailing market rate. A noninterest-bearing advance deposit up to 100 percent of value may be required to open letters of 443 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SOMALIA credit for private sector imports; the deposit is retained up to the settlement date of the letter of credit. Payments for Invisibles Payments to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Payments for current invisibles through export- promoting, and import accounts, as well as through the commercial bank selling foreign exchange on its own account, are subject to licensing to prevent unauthorized capital movements. There are no controls on invisible payments if they are made with foreign exchange through an external account. Transfer of salaries, wages, gratuities, and allowances paid in Somalia to foreign personnel by enterprises registered under the Foreign Investment Law are allowed up to 50 percent. Transfers for education are allowed within the limit of US$1,500 per student per year. A traveler is automatically entitled to an allowance of US$200 per trip. In addition, a traveler is entitled to an allowance of up to US$50 per traveling day with a maximum of US$1,000 per trip, depending on the purpose of travel. The Central Bank considers applications for larger allowances or other invisibles on the basis of documentation and processes such applications within one week after submission. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports and re-exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Bananas are exported only by the Somali Fruits Company (previously the National Banana Board). The export of various types of ivory, hides and skins, and minerals is subject to prior approval. All export proceeds must be repatriated. Exporters may retain up to 65 percent of their foreign exchange receipts in export-promoting accounts and must surren- der the remainder to the Central Bank or to the authorized dealer within five business days after their receipt. For exports other than those made under letter of credit arrangements, an advance payment deposit of 30 percent of the value of exports is required. There is a 25 percent tax on exports of livestock. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles are subject to repatriation and declaration. Exporters of services may retain up to 65 percent of their foreign exchange receipts in export- promoting accounts; they must surrender the remainder to the Central Bank or to the authorized dealer within five business days after their receipt.

Resident travelers may bring in up to So. Sh. 200 in Somali bank notes and coin and are obliged, upon arrival, to declare any foreign exchange they bring in and to deposit it in external accounts or sell it to the commercial bank at the prevailing market rate within five days. 444 Capital Capital transactions are subject to licensing unless they are authorized by the Foreign Investment Law of February 1960, as amended in January 1977. In accor- dance with the provisions of that law, foreign enterprises must be registered with the Directorate of Planning and Coordination. For "productive" enterprises (as defined in the Foreign Investment Law), profits may be transferred abroad freely up to an annual limit of 30 percent of invested capital; unused portions of transfer rights can be cumulated for three years; and should the profit in any one year be less than 30 percent, the transfer right for the succeeding three years is increased correspondingly. The capital itself may be transferred abroad beginning five years after the date of registration. Profits resulting from other foreign investments may be transferred abroad up to a limit of 10 percent a year of the capital invested, and the capital itself may be transferred abroad over a minimum period of three years, beginning seven years after the date of registration. The Ministry of Finance, upon the recommendation of other ministries concerned, may extend total or partial exemption from import and export taxes, excise duty, income tax, and municipal tax to any enterprise for a period not exceeding five years. Enterprises registered in or after March 1968 must, to the largest possible extent, employ residents, and each enterprise must submit to the Committee "on Foreign Investments a program for the substitution of nonresidents by resident employees. Gold Residents may hold and acquire in Somalia, for numismatic purposes only, gold coins that are not legal tender in any country. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require the permission of the Central Bank; such permis- sion is not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. Gold imported by jewelers must be melted down within one month to a fineness of not more than 22 karats. Imports of gold are exempt from customs duty when originating in EC countries, and imports from elsewhere are subject to a 10 percent duty.

The principal interven- tion currency is the U .S. dollar. On December 31, 1984 the commercial banks' spot rates for the U .S. dollar in transactions with the public were US$0.5045 buy ing and US$0.5035 selling, per R 1. Subject to certain limita- tions, authorized dealers are permitted to conduct for- ward exchange operations, including cover for transac- tions by nonresidents on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.

S. dollar swap transactions with a margin based on an interest rate differential between the U .S. dollar and the rand. The Reserve Bank also provides forward cover contracts in U .S. dollars for longer maturities for governmental and other public sector institutions such as public corporations. South African gold mines may sell forward in the market a portion of the projected foreign exchange proceeds from their future sales of gold to the Reserve Bank. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. South Africa formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund's Articles of Agreement, as of September 15, 1973. Exchange Control Territory There are virtually no exchange or trade restrictions between the Republic of South Africa (defined for exchange control purposes as including South West Afr ica), Lesotho, and Swaziland, and these form, w i th the Republic of South Africa, a single exchange control territory: the Rand Monetary Area. Administration of Control Exchange licensing is the responsibility of the Trea- sury, which has delegated this authority to the South African Reserve Bank; in turn, the Reserve Bank has delegated much of its licensing powers to the authorized dealers. Import and export permits are issued by the Director of Import and Export Control acting on behalf of the Minister of Trade and Industry. Exchange for licensed imports is made available by the authorized dealers upon proof of shipment or, where advance payment is proposed, upon presentation of other docu- mentary evidence, which must include the prior approval of the Reserve Bank .! 'Au thor ized dealers can permit, w i thout Reserve Bank approval, advance payment of up to 33 '/3 percent of the ex-factory cost of capital goods if such is the requirement of suppliers. 446 Prescription of Currency All countries outside the Rand Monetary Area consti- tute the Nonresident Area. The only settlement currency accepted in all countries in the Rand Monetary Area is the rand .2 Settlements by residents of the Rand Mone- tary Area with the Nonresident Area may be made in rand to and from a Nonresident Account and in any specified currency3 and, for outgoing payments only, in any foreign currency.4 Nonresident Accounts The rand accounts of persons resident outside the Rand Monetary Area are divided into Nonresident Accounts and Blocked Accounts. Nonresident Accounts are held by persons, firms, or companies (including banks) resident, domiciled, or registered outside the Rand' Monetary Area. They may be credited with all authorized payments by South African residents, with the proceeds of sales to autho- rized dealers in South Africa of specified currency, w i th payments from other Nonresident Accounts in South Africa, and with the local sale proceeds of nonresident- owned assets. They may be debited for payments to Rand Monetary Area residents for any purpose; for payments to nonresidents for any purpose, that is, by transfer to a local Nonresident Account, or for remit- tance to any country outside the Rand Monetary Area; for the cost of purchases of any foreign currency; and for payments to the account holder while temporarily resi- dent in South Africa for short periods. Blocked Accounts are the accounts of emigrants from the Rand Monetary Area to which exchange control restrictions have been applied. They must be credited with any cash held at the time of departure and w i th the proceeds of any other South African asset held at the time of departure and subsequently sold. Such funds may not be transferred from South Africa or to another Blocked Account in South Africa, but may be retained on deposit with an authorized dealer, used w i th in certain limits for the holder's living expenses while visiting 2L i langeni bank notes issued by Swaziland are freely conver t ib le into rand, at par, w i thout restriction at the Central Bank of Swaz i land, but they are not legal tender in South A f r ica. The same rules apply to maloti bank notes issued by Lesotho. Checks and other b i l ls of exchange drawn by Lesotho and Swazi residents for payment w i th in the Rand Monetary Area must be denominated in rand. 3Au s t ra l ian dollars, Austrian sch i l l ings, Belgian francs, Canad ian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Fiji dollars, French francs, Hong Kong dollars, Indian rupees, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Kenya sh i l l ings, Malagasy francs, Ma lawi kwacha, Ne ther lands gu i lde rs, New Zealand dollars, Norwegian kroner, Pakistan rupees, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Seychelles rupees, Spanish pesetas, Sri Lanka rupees, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, Uganda sh i l l ings, U .S. dollars, zaires, and Zambian kwacha. 4 Foreign currency is any currency or payment ins t rument for currency other than a currency that is legal tender in a country in the Rand Monetary Area. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution South Africa, or for other specified payments to resi- dents, or be invested in any securities that are quoted locally; such securities may not, however, be exported and sold abroad. Imports and Import Payments All importers requiring import permits for trade or manufacturing purposes must be registered with the Director of Import and Export Control. The permits are valid for imports from any country. Imports free of permit include all goods imported from Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe that were grown, produced, or manufactured in those countries, w i th the exception of sugar from Swaziland and tea from Malawi and Zimbabwe. The Import Control Regulations for 1984 distinguish between the following broad categories of imports: (1) goods that may be imported w i thout an import permit, and (2) goods that may be imported only under permit. An importer is automatically granted exchange to pay for the import upon presenting to his bank the necessary consignment documents (proof of importation), and an import permit where required. Payments prior to the date of shipment or dispatch are not normally allowed, except with prior approval or special authorization by the Reserve Bank (see footnote 1). With certain exceptions, imports are subject to a general sales tax of 10 percent,5 as are locally produced goods. Payments for Invisibles Authority is delegated to the authorized dealers to approve certain current payments for invisibles w i thout limitation and for others up to established limits. Applications for amounts in excess of these limits are considered on their merits by the Reserve Bank. For current income payments, such as declared dividends, profits, royalties, etc., that accrue in South Africa, approval is given by the authorized dealers without reference to the Reserve Bank, provided that the relative royalty agreement was approved by the Department of Trade and Industry and the Reserve Bank, and the remittance of profits and dividends does not involve the use of local credit facilities. Favorable consideration is, however, given by the Reserve Bank to such transfers where the use of local credit facilities is not regarded as excessive. Income derived from securities acquired w i th blocked funds or otherwise held by nonresidents is freely transferable to the owner's country of residence. Limited amounts of exchange to pay for membership fees, family maintenance, e tc ., are authorized. The basic allowance for tourist travel in a year is R 6,000 for an adult and R 3,000 for a child under 12 years. Separately, there is an annual basic exchange allocation of R 2,000 for an adult (R 1,000 for a child under 12) for travel to Angola, Botswana, Ma law i, 5 On March 25, 1985, the general sales tax was raised from 10 percent to 12 percent. SOUTH AFRICA Mozambique, Zaire, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and the Indian Ocean Islands. In addition to the tourist allowances, authorized dealers may grant allowances for business trips overseas at a rate not exceeding R 500 a day, w i th a max imum of R 10,000 in a calendar year. The separate applicable allowance for business trips to the neigh- boring territories mentioned above is R 4,000 a year, at a rate not exceeding R 400 a day. Residents leaving South Africa for destinations out- side the Rand Monetary Area may take the f u ll applica- ble allowance in foreign bank notes. The amount of South African Reserve Bank notes, however, may not exceed R 200, but these are not regarded as being part of the basic travel allowance. Foreign visitors leaving South Africa may take with them up to R 200 in Reserve Bank notes and any amount of foreign notes wh ich they brought into the country or obtained from the disposal of instruments of exchange that they brought to and exchanged in South Africa. These limitations on the export of Reserve Bank notes do not apply in the case of contract workers returning to neighboring countries who are permitted to take with them reasonable amounts in bank notes. There are no limitations on the export of domestic currency to Lesotho and Swaziland. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of specified commodities considered as being in relatively short supply or controlled for strategic reasons require export permits for their sales to buyers outside the United Kingdom, any Commonwealth coun- try, any British colony, protectorate, or trust territory, and the United States. Unless otherwise permitted, all export proceeds must be remitted to South Africa and surrendered within six months from the date of shipment or seven days from the date of accrual. •Exporters may grant credit up to 12 mon ths, provided the credit is necessary in the particular trade or needed to protect an existing export market or to capture a new export market. Beginning from April 1, 1985, voluntary restraint is applied on exports of certain steel products to the United States; retroactively from October 1, 1984, the vo lun tary restraint has been formalized in the form of a five-year agreement6 on restraint on exports of certain types of steel from South Africa to the United States. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles must be surrendered w i th in seven days from the date of accrual, unless exemption is 6On January 18, 1985, w i th retroactive effect from October 1, 1984, South Afr ica concluded a five-year agreement w i th the Un i ted States, w i th a view to controlling exports of specified types of steel to that coun try. Three control periods were established by the agreement as follows: (a) October 1, 1984 to December 3 1, 1985; (b) the three calendar years 1986 through 1988; and (c) January 1 to September 30, 1989. The quotas for the various categories of steel products du r ing the agreement period would be determined annu a l ly and adjusted periodic- a l ly on the basis of the projected consumption of these categories in the Un i ted States du r ing a specified control period. 447 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SOUTH AFRICA obtained. Upon entry from countries outside the Rand Monetary Area, residents and nonresidents may bring in R 200 in South African Reserve Bank notes. There are no limitations on the import of domestic currency from Lesotho and Swaziland. Capital7 All inward loan transfers require specific approval,8 while inward transfers for investment in equity capital are freely permitted. Foreign exchange accruing to residents from capital transfers and transactions must be surrendered. Outward transfers of capital by residents to destinations outside the Rand Monetary Area require the approval of the Reserve Bank. Local borrowing by nonresident-owned or nonresident-controlled firms is subject to limitation. Transfers by residents for the purchase of South African (or other) shares on foreign stock exchanges are generally not permitted (except in amounts not exceeding R 2,000 for each shareholder, to allow South African residents to exercise rights arising from existing holdings of shares in foreign companies quoted only on foreign stock exchanges), although South African stockbrokers may engage in arbitrage transac- tions in securities, subject to certain conditions designed to prevent any net outflow of exchange. Applications by South African residents to retain in, or transfer to, countries outside the Rand Monetary Area funds for bona fide long-term investment in specific development projects or for the expansion of existing projects that are owned or controlled by South Africans are considered by the Reserve Bank and the Treasury on their merits. Investments designed to foster exports and to maintain or expand markets abroad are normally viewed favorably. Immigrants are required to furnish the exchange control authorities with a complete return of their foreign assets and liabilities at the time of their arrival. Any foreign assets transferred to South Africa may be retransferred abroad within the first three years after arrival. The proceeds of the sale of quoted or unquoted South African securities, real estate, and other equity invest- ments by nonresidents of South Africa to residents must be credited to Nonresident Accounts and are accordingly transferable. Emigrant families are entitled to the normal travel allowance and are permitted to remit up to R 100,000 (R 50,000 for single persons). Any balance exceeding 7For exchange control purposes, a nonresident is defined as a person whose normal place of residence or domicile is outside the Rand Monetary Area. Securities are defined as including not only quoted stocks, shares, debentures, and rights but also unquoted shares in pub l ic companies, shares in private companies, government, mun ic ipa l, and public u t i l i ty stocks, nonresident-owned mortgage bonds or participations in mortgage bonds, and national savings certificates. The terms "scrip" and "share certificates" include any temporary or substitute documents of title, such as letters of allotment, option certificates, balance receipts, and any other receipts for scrip. 8 Approval is generally given for borrowing abroad w i th a maturity of at least six months by domestic entrepreneurs, except for speculation or consumer credit. Authorized dealers generally are permitted to raise funds abroad in their own names for the f inanc ing of South African foreign trade and other approved purposes. 448 the permissible transferable amount must be credited to a Blocked Account. The total net income earned from an emigrant's blocked assets may be transferred. An emi- grant family or an individual can export one motor vehicle, with a maximum value of R 20,000, provided that it was purchased at least one year prior to emigra- tion, and can export other household and personal effects up to a value of R 20,000 for each family, provided that such goods, other than clothing, have been in the emigrant's possession for a period of not less than one year. Favorable consideration is given for the transfer by nonresident-owned branches and subsidiaries of open or approved loan account balances, of profits and of dividends declared on profits, provided that the remit- tance does not involve the excessive use of local credit facilities. The physical export from South Africa of nonresident-owned securities is permitted, except by emigrants on their departure. Gold Residents of South Africa may purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in South Africa for numismatic and investment purposes. With this exception, residents of South Africa other than the monetary authorities, autho- rized dealers, registered gold producers, and authorized industrial and professional users are not allowed to purchase, hold, or sell gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. All exports of gold require the prior approval of the Reserve Bank; the approval authority has been delegated to authorized dealers in respect of exports of jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler (subject to a written declaration to the effect that the jewelry will be brought back to South Africa on the traveler's return) and in respect of exports of gold jewelry by manufacturing jewelers (except for exports to Botswana, Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe), subject to a written declaration that the articles are in fu l ly manufactured form and that the gold content of each does not exceed 80 percent of the selling price to the ultimate consignee. Furthermore, after reference and approval by the Reserve Bank, residents are allowed to export currency coins, including certain gold coins, for sale to numismatists. The gold mining industry must sell its output to the Reserve Bank within one month of production. Beginning from September 1983, the Re- serve Bank operates an arrangement under which gold mines in South Africa are paid in U .S. dollars for gold sold by them to the Reserve Bank.9 As a special concession, the industry may retain approximately one third of its production for the minting of gold coins and kilo bars. The M int from time to time strikes gold coins and the Krugerrand without a face value, which are legal tender 9On January 29, 1985, in l ight of the considered abnormal conditions in the foreign exchange market, it was decided as an interim measure that the Reserve Bank would pay the gold mines in U .S. dollars for only 50 percent of their sales and the balance in rand. ©International Monetary Fund.

Not for Redistribution SPAIN (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Spain is the Spanish Peseta. The authorities of Spain do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions, and exchange rates are deter- mined largely on the basis of demand and supply conditions in the exchange markets. However, the authorities intervene when necessary in order to smooth out fluctuations in exchange rates and to maintain stability in the exchange market. Official buying and selling rates for specified currencies1 are fixed daily by the Bank of Spain (the central bank), acting in consulta- tion with the authorized banks. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. The Bank of Spain also quotes each week buying and selling rates for bank notes in specified currencies. Purchases and sales of clearing currencies are centralized in the Bank of Spain, which publishes the rates at which it settles direct transactions. These rates are the same as the prevailing rates for the U.S. dollar. Authorized banks are allowed to operate in foreign markets for spot and forward transactions related to commercial operations up to 360 days. Forward cover may be provided to residents for all permitted foreign exchange receipts and for import payments. Forward contracts may not exceed 12 months, and forward purchases and sales of exchange are restricted to curren- cies admitted to the Madrid foreign exchange market. The terms of the forward contract must coincide with the terms of the commercial transactions that are being covered. The forward position of an individual bank at the close of each day must not reflect a net buying or selling position in U.S. dollars in excess of US$1 mil- lion; in French francs, deutsche mark, Swiss francs, Italian lire, and Japanese yen in excess of US$0.25 mil- lion; and in each other convertible currency in excess of US$100,000. In addition, commercial banks can pur- chase foreign exchange to cover a forward contract six months prior to the maturity of contract. Exchange Control Territory The Peninsular Territories of the Spanish State, the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands, Ceuta, and Melilla constitute a single exchange control territory. Administration of Control The guidelines on foreign exchange policy are for- mulated by an interministerial commission. The Ministry of Economy and Commerce is in charge of administra- tive functions connected with exchange and trade con- trols, as well as controls over Spanish investment 'Aus tr ian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Irish pounds, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and U .S. dollars. 450 abroad, private Spanish lending abroad, foreign financ- ing of trade, and the registration of foreign investments in Spain. The Bank of Spain is in charge of operative functions, in particular, the handling of external re- serves. It is also responsible for the authorization of short-term and long-term loans in foreign currency to residents for nontrade purposes. Contracts relating to technological matters must be registered with the Minis- try of Industry and Energy. Prescription of Currency Settlements on account of merchandise transactions and invisibles may be made in any specified currency (see footnote 1), but they are usually made in the currency of the country of origin or destination. There are no bilateral payments arrangements. Nonresident Accounts There are several types of nonresident accounts, as follows: Convertible Peseta Accounts. Following abolition in January 1981 of the A Accounts and B Accounts in pesetas, nonresidents are now permitted to hold Convert- ible Peseta Accounts, balances in which can be freely converted into foreign currency; existing peseta balances in A Accounts and B Accounts automatically become convertible peseta balances. These Convertible Peseta Accounts may be credited with the proceeds of foreign currency (other than bank notes) sold in the Spanish foreign currency market, with authorized payments made by residents to nonresidents as a result of any balance of payments transaction, with accrued interest on such accounts, and with transfer from other such accounts. Convertible Peseta Accounts may be debited for purchases of equivalent amounts of foreign currency and bank notes in the Spanish foreign currency market, for authorized payments in pesetas to residents as a result of any balance of payments transaction, for cash draw- ings by nonresidents, and for transfers to other peseta accounts. Interest on Convertible Peseta Accounts can be freely established by authorized banks, and balances are not subject to reserve requirements. Balances in Con- vertible Peseta Accounts are eligible for forward cover in the Spanish forward exchange market. External Accounts in Internal Pesetas are designed to hold nonresidents' funds accruing in Spain that are not transferable abroad. Automatic approval is given to open such accounts. Balances are freely negotiable between nonresidents holding such accounts. These accounts may be credited freely with (1) the fu ll proceeds of the sale by a nonresident to a resident of Spanish real estate originally acquired with pesetas from an External Ac- count in Internal Pesetas; (2) the full proceeds of the sale by a nonresident to a resident of Spanish shares and fixed-interest securities that have been acquired with ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution pesetas from an External Account in Internal Pesetas and have been held for less than three years consecutively by the same owner;2 (3) interest received on balances held in these accounts; and (4) transfers from any other External Accounts in Internal Pesetas. They may be debited freely for (1) payments of any amount of personal expenses in Spain qf the account holder and his close relatives (a manager's personal expenses if the account is opened in the name of a juridical person); (2) the purchase of shares quoted on the stock exchange and of Spanish fixed-interest securities; (3) the purchase for the use of the account holder (provided that the account holder is a nonresident physical person) of urban and rural properties that do not represent investment for commercial, industrial, or agricultural purposes (appli- cable to rural properties only if the account holder is of Spanish nationality); (4) the purchase of National Lottery tickets; and (5) transfers to any other External Accounts in Internal Pesetas. All other entries on these accounts require prior authorization, and the accounts may not be overdrawn. Nonresident Accounts in Convertible Foreign Curren- cies may be held by nonresidents; resident foreign nationals may maintain such accounts only if opened before January 1, 1968, in order to maintain acquired rights. The deposits may be either sight or time. The accounts may be credited with convertible currencies quoted in the Spanish exchange market and with any amount of interest. They may be debited freely for reconversion into the currency initially deposited, for the purchase of other convertible currencies quoted in the Spanish exchange market, and for conversion into pesetas, including the transfer to a Convertible Peseta Account. Overdrafts are prohibited except for mail credits in favor of foreign banks. Emigrants' Accounts. Since October 29, 1970, com- mercial banks have been authorized to open savings accounts in convertible pesetas for Spanish citizens working abroad. The regulations were modified by Royal Decree No. 1222/77. Tourist Accounts. Foreign nonresident tourists in Spain may open ordinary peseta accounts with autho- rized institutions in an amount not exceeding Ptas 200,000 for an account; such an account must always show a credit balance position. These accounts may be credited with receipts from foreign exchange conversion, with peseta bank notes in the possession of the tourist on entering Spain (a max imum of Ptas 150,000 in each trip), with funds from other Convertible Peseta Accounts, and with ordinary pesetas received in Spain by the tourist. Debits on such accounts may be made to cover the tourist's living expenses in Spain as well as payments of the tourist's household expenses. Balances in these accounts cannot be trans- ferred abroad. 2 The proceeds of such securities that have been held for at least three years consecutively are transferable abroad. SPAIN Nonresident Accounts Relating to Execution of Busi- ness Contracts. Nonresidents must open a peseta account in an authorized institution in connection with the execution of business projects for a resident, to facilitate reporting on receipts and payments under such contracts. Such accounts may be credited with working capital brought in by the nonresident contractor and with payments over time by the residents concerned. Funds imported under this arrangement must be converted into pesetas, are noninterest-bearing, and may not be repatri- ated until after six months from the entry date. The accounts may be debited with payments by nonresidents for the execution of the project. Balances on such accounts are transferable abroad, after verification by the Directorate-General of External Transactions that the amounts conform to the terms of the contracts. Imports and Import Payments Most imports are admitted under the following ar- rangements: (1) free imports, (2) global quotas, (3) state trading, and (4) individual licensing, also referred to as the "bilateral import regime." All imports require either an import license or an "import declaration" issued by the Directorate-General of Tariff Policy and Imports (Ministry of Economy and Commerce). Provided that import prices are not considered abnormal, import declarations are issued freely for a large number of goods (mostly foodstuffs not under state trading, raw materials, capital goods, and spare parts, and also some consumer goods) included in an import free list that applies to most countries.3 All other imports require licenses. There are global quotas for specified imports from countries to which the free list applies, but licenses are usually granted for larger amounts; separate global quotas exist for imports of these same commodities from EC countries. With certain exceptions, the global quota regime also applies to goods of Japanese origin. Licenses for imports from Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the U .S .S .R. are issued freely. Imports of cotton, certain other agricultural products, and tobacco are state traded. Some goods formally listed as being subject to state trading, such as feedgrains and raw cotton, may be freely imported by private traders. Imports of certain agricultural products that are free of quantitative restriction and previously were state traded are subject to variable import levies. Import subsidies are paid on certain foodstuffs and specified other essential commodities. Exchange in the appropriate currency to pay for authorized imports is granted freely. Except for capital goods, suppliers' credit for imports is not normally permitted to exceed 90 days. All import transactions must be domiciled with an authorized bank, and the import payment must be made through the bank of domiciliation; exempt from domiciliation are transac- 3The import free list does not apply to A fgh an i s t an, A lb an i a, Andorra, B h u t a n, the People's Repub l ic of Ch ina, the Democratic People's Repub l ic of Korea, the Lao People's Democratic Repub l ic, Mongolia, Nepa l, San Marino, Tibet, the U . S . S .R ., and Viet Nam. 451 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SPAIN tions valued at less than Ptas 0.5 million, provided that payment is to be made within one year. Payments for Invisibles Banks are authorized to sell foreign exchange freely for listed current invisibles, provided that the request is supported by appropriate documents to verify the authen- ticity of the transaction. Holders of Spanish securities may freely transfer abroad accrued interest, dividends, and proceeds from the disposal of subscription rights; the securities must have been purchased with convertible pesetas, with pesetas resulting from the sale of foreign exchange, or with pesetas released from External Ac- counts in Internal Pesetas. Profits and dividends on direct investments are also freely transferable abroad. Rents on nonresident-owned real estate are transferable, provided that the purchase price has been paid in fu l l. A general license permits the reinsurance abroad of risks insured in Spain with Spanish firms or with foreign insurance companies operating in Spain. Unless special authorization is otherwise granted, insurance contracts abroad are restricted to cover for exports and imports of goods and related operations. Payments up to Ptas 50,000 for any purpose may be made without any supporting documents. For larger payments, declarations to the Directorate-General of External Transactions in the Ministry of Economy and Commerce are required. The basic exchange allowance for tourism is Ptas 80,000 a person a journey, with an annual maximum of Ptas 320,000. The authorized banks are free to sell the equivalent of Ptas 200,000 a person for each business trip, with an annual maximum of Ptas 1.4 million, and any amount for travel for education or health care. Travelers may take with them Ptas 20,000 in notes of the Bank of Spain. The sale of foreign exchange for amounts in excess of the above limits and for current invisibles not specifically listed requires a prior declaration to the Ministry of Economy and Commerce. Proceeds from the liquidation of foreign investments are freely transferable abroad provided they were not financed from External Accounts in Internal Pesetas. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports are subject to prior licensing by the Direc- torate-General of Exportation. All export proceeds must be sold in the exchange market or to the Bank of Spain through authorized banks w i th in 15 days of receipt. Certain agricultural products may be subject to an export tax, but this practice is unusua l. Since April 1980 some goods included in a list published by the Directorate- General of Exportation may be exported without a license if payment is made in convertible foreign currency and w i th in six months of export; in this case, only a declaration before the customs is required. Proceeds from Invisibles All exchange proceeds from invisibles must be sold in the exchange market or to the Bank of Spain through authorized banks w i th in 15 days of receipt. 452 Capital 1. Inward Transfers (a) Foreign direct investments. As a general rule, there are no restrictions on foreign capital investments which lead to ownership of up to 50 percent of the capital of Spanish companies, or are related to capital increases in Spanish companies where the foreign participation ratio is not altered. Prior administrative authorization is normally required for foreign investments of more than 50 percent. Special foreign participation ratios and regulations apply to certain specific activities.4 Thus, foreign capital investments are not allowed in defense industries, the news media, and public utilities, while in public service companies foreign capital holdings may not exceed 25 percent. Under Royal Decree No. 6227 1981 of March 27, 1981, investments by foreign resi- dents with ordinary pesetas are not considered as foreign investments. Where investment authorization is needed, the process is decentralized, with approval from the Council of Ministers needed only when the investment amounts are over Ptas 500 million. For lower amounts, authorization is given by the Ministry for Economy and Commerce or the Directorate-General of External Transactions with the participation in some cases of the Foreign Investment Board. The Royal Decree also authorizes Spanish branches of foreign companies to carry out direct investments, subject to the approval of the Directorate- General of External Transactions. Under Royal Decree No. 623/1981, of March 27, 1981, foreign investment up to Ptas 25 million, carried out by nonresidents or Spanish firms with foreign participation, for the establishment of new firms (or the acquisition of branches of real estate) is unrestricted. The Royal Decree also grants general authorization for Spanish companies to effect capital increases debited to free disposable reserves, provided that there is no increase in the percentage of foreign participation. Similar authorization is granted for foreign investment in capital increases for the normal expansion of Spanish companies, without increasing the percentage of foreign participation. Under this Royal Decree, foreign invest- ments w i th in the specified liberalized regime must be declared to the Directorate-General of External Transac- tions (Ministry of Economy and Commerce) for verifica- tion; they may be taken as accepted if there is no response from the latter w i th in 30 working days. Foreign direct investments are also authorized in Spanish companies that are in the process of increasing their capital. This may be effected through the purchase 4The foreign content of investment by Spanish companies w i th foreign participation is determined in the fo l low ing manner: (1) if foreign participation exceeds 50 percent, the inves tment is considered 100 percent foreign; (2) if foreign participation is over 25 percent but equal to or less than 50 percent, the inve s tment is considered foreign to the ex tent of such participation; nevertheless, if foreign investors enjoy a position of dom inance, the inve s tment is considered 100 percent foreign; and (3) if foreign par t ic ipa t ion is 25 percent or less or if there is Span ish Government par t ic ipa t ion, the inves tment is considered domestic. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution of shares or investment in the capital, provided that the company creates 100 permanent jobs, that the foreign currency account shows a positive balance after one year of production, that the total capital and reserves of the company are increased by at least 30 percent, and that at least Ptas 100 million is invested in the purchase of shares. Foreign investments may be effected by transferring currencies that are negotiable in the Spanish exchange market, by using convertible pesetas, by bringing in capital goods, by reinvesting profits or capital transfer- able under the Foreign Investment Law, or by providing technology, patents, or licenses. Profits and dividends on direct investments are freely transferable abroad. Proceeds, including capital gains, from the liquidation of foreign direct investments may be transferred freely. (b) Portfolio investments. Such investments in shares are treated as direct investment. Purchases by nonresi- dents of shares in most Spanish companies are unre- stricted up to 50 percent of the capital of Spanish companies; purchases of bonds are unrestricted. This applies to shares acquired by Spaniards resident abroad as well as by resident or nonresident foreigners with foreign capital. Portfolio and direct investments in nonspecified sectors by nonresident foreigners are not considered as foreign investments. Proceeds, including capital gains, from the liquidation of such shares may be transferred abroad at any time or used for further purchases of shares.5 Purchases by nonresidents of bonds and other fixed-income securities representing debts of either Spanish companies or the Spanish Government and its agencies are unrestricted when financed as indicated in this paragraph, and the full sales proceeds are transferable. The purchase by nonresidents of bank certificates of deposit requires special authoriza- tion, but nonresidents may freely purchase bonds issued by banks with a maturity of five years or more. (c) Real estate investments. Foreign investment of up to Ptas 25 million carried out by nonresidents or Spanish firms with foreign participation, for the acquisition of branches of real estate (or the establishment of new firms) is not subject to restrictions. Investment of over Ptas 25 million in Spanish real estate by nonresidents is, within certain limits,6 freely permitted if financed with pesetas derived from convertible currencies or from balances in Convertible Peseta Accounts held by nonres- idents. The Ministry of Economy and Commerce has empowered authorized banks to provide the investor with a document certifying that he owns such pesetas; this is the only requirement for official registration of the 5However, if the purchase was made with internal pesetas, the owner of the shares must hold them for three years, after which he may transfer the liquidation proceeds abroad. 6 Purchases of real estate by nonresident physical persons of foreign nationality, if financed with funds imported from abroad, are freely permitted by a general authorization, as follows: (1) one plot not exceeding 5,000 square meters for one single-family dwelling for personal use, (2) the land needed for the construction of an apartment building, and (3) up to three apartments in a single apartment building. There are separate regulations governing the purchase of business premises (see Royal Decree No. 623/81). SPAIN change in ownership. Certain investments in real estate may also be financed from External Accounts in Internal Pesetas. Irrespective of the method of financing, rural properties purchased in excess of 4 hectares of irrigated land or 20 hectares of unirrigated land require authoriza- tion from the Council of Ministers. When Spanish real estate acquired under the 1974 Foreign Investment Act is sold to a resident, the fu ll sales proceeds are transferable if the initial purchase was financed with convertible for- eign currency or with pesetas from an External Account in Convertible Pesetas. If the initial purchase was fi- nanced with pesetas from an External Account in Inter- nal Pesetas, no part of the sale proceeds is transferable. Rents on nonresident-owned real estate are transfer- able, provided that the purchase price has been paid in fu l l. (d) Bank credit. Spanish firms with foreign partici- pation in excess of 25 percent are authorized to avail themselves of local bank credit up to five times their capital stock; domestic bank credit beyond this limit requires prior authorization from the General Directorate of Financial Policy in the Ministry of Commerce and Energy, unless the excess would only involve a ratio between foreign and local credit equal to or greater than the existing ratio of foreign to local participation in the company's capital. (e) Foreign currency deposits. Nonbank residents are not allowed to hold foreign currency deposits with resident banks, or foreign currency (and peseta) deposits with nonresident banks without prior authorization. (f) Other credits. The granting of loans by nonresi- dents to residents requires authorization by the Bank of Spain. For loans with an average term to maturity of one year or more, approval is granted automatically if the application is not questioned or rejected within 15 working days by the Bank of Spain. Suppliers' credits extended to residents by nonresidents require authoriza- tion by the Ministry of Economy and Commerce. Certificates of deposit issued by banks can only be purchased by nonresidents subject to authorization; long- term bonds of banks (5 to 10 years) can be purchased freely. 2. Outward Transfers (a) Direct investments. Direct investments abroad by residents are permitted freely provided one of the following conditions is met: (1) the share of the Spanish investment is at least 20 percent of the capital of the foreign company; (2) the Spanish investor participates in the management of the foreign company or otherwise exercises an important influence over it; or (3) the foreign company uses exclusively or predominantly technology provided by the Spanish investor. Direct in- vestment projects abroad must be declared to the Directorate-General of External Transactions for verifi- cation of authenticity and for statistical control. If no ad- ministrative notification is received regarding the project within 30 days of the declaration, the parties concerned may proceed with the investment. The investment must 453 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SPAIN be carried out, in principle, within a period of six months. Direct investments in foreign companies leading to the purchase and holding of securities and the purchase of real estate are not liberalized. (b) Portfolio investments. Banks, savings institutions, and insurance companies may purchase foreign securi- ties in foreign stock markets up to 10 percent of the increase in their own resources in any one year. In the case of existing establishments, the increased resources are calculated from the date on which Royal Decree No. 2236/79 of September 14, 1979 (providing for the liberalization of Spanish investments abroad) became effective; for new establishments, the calculation is made from the date on which the minimum legal requirements for subscribed and paid-up capital become effective. Under the same decree, Spanish residents are free to purchase fixed-income securities denominated in foreign exchange and issued by Spanish private and public institutions and by international organizations in which Spain is a member. Acquisition and disposal of such securities must be reported to the Directorate- General of External Transactions. Following a tempo- rary suspension in February 1982, suspension of the decree was extended for a 12-month period in February 1983; prior authorization from the Ministry of Economy and Commerce thus continues to be required to transfer funds abroad for investments in foreign bonds and other financial instruments. All other Spanish investments abroad require prior authorization, which is handled by the Directorate- General of External Transactions if the investment does not exceed Ptas 100 million and by the Ministry of Economy and Commerce in the case of higher amounts. (c) Loans. Requests by nonbank residents to grant loans to nonresidents and for suppliers' credits from Spanish residents to nonresidents require authorization by the Ministry of Economy and Commerce. Beginning in June 1982, requests for the early repayment of loans denominated in foreign currency are subject to a freeze imposed by the Bank of Spain. There has been no experience with the issuing of bonds in the Spanish capital market by nonresidents, nor with short-term credits granted by Spanish banks to nonresidents other than certain export credits granted directly to foreign importers. Credits to nonresidents for transactions with Spain may, however, be authorized by the Ministry of Economy and Commerce. Furthermore, authorized banks may extend various types of credit to nonresidents, provided that this credit is financed with funds deposited in Spain in nonresident convertible currency accounts; some forms of such credit do not require prior approval by the Ministry of Economy and Commerce. Commercial banks are prohibited from establishing short-term swap positions with pesetas for more than two days. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold in any form in Spain. Purchases of gold, silver, and platinum ingots are subject to a luxury tax of 30 percent, but gold purchased for industrial use is exempt from the tax. Imports of gold are subject to quotas issued by the Ministry of Economy and Commerce. Such quotas are granted to industrial users for purposes of manufacturing jewelry and other articles. Changes During 1984 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 454 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SRI LANKA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Sri Lanka is the Sri Lanka Rupee, for which the U.S. dollar is the intervention currency. The exchange rate of the Sri Lanka rupee is adjusted periodically by the Central Bank, taking account of domestic price developments relative to those of Sri Lanka's six major trading partners (France, the Federal Republic of Germany, India, Japan, the United King- dom, and the United States). The Central Bank deter- mines daily the spot buying and selling rates of the U .S. dollar against the Sri Lanka rupee for its transactions with the commercial banks; it purchases and sells the U .S. dollar on a spot basis at the buy ing and selling rates so established. On December 31, 1984 the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were SL Rs 26.2725 and SL Rs 26.2875, respectively, per US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. The Central Bank provides forward cover to commer- cial banks for their sales and purchases in U .S. dollars only; the period of such cover is up to three months. One-month forward dollars are purchased at the spot middle rate and sold at a premium of SL Rs 7.50 per US$100 against the spot middle rate. Three-month forward dollars are purchased and sold at a discount of SL Rs 0.50 at a premium of SL Rs 22.00, respectively, per US$100 against the spot middle rate. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Department of Exchange Control of the Central Bank as agent of the Government. All remittances of foreign exchange in Sri Lanka must normally be made through commercial banks authorized to carry out operations in foreign currencies in accordance with the exchange control procedures prescribed by the Controller of Exchange. Remittances may also be made through post offices, under permits issued by the Controller of Exchange. The Foreign Investment Advisory Committee handles applications relating to foreign investment in areas other than those coming within the purview of the Greater Colombo Economic Commission (GCEC), which ad- ministers the Investment Promotion Zone. Prescription of Currency Payments to, and receipts from, member countries of the Asian Clearing Union (i .e ., Bangladesh, Burma, India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Nepal, and Pakistan) in respect of current transactions must be effected in Asian Monetary Units or in the currency of a member of the Asian Clearing Union. For settlements with all other countries, payments for imports may be made in any foreign currency or in Sri Lanka rupees. Other payments may be made either in the currency of the country to wh ich the payment is due or by crediting Sri Lanka rupees to an External Rupee Account. Proceeds from exports must be received in designated foreign currencies.1 Other receipts may be accepted in Sri Lanka rupees from an External Rupee Account or in any designated foreign currency (see footnote 1). Nonresident Accounts Nonresident accounts may be held in any commercial bank in Sri Lanka by (a) nonnationals resident outside Sri Lanka; (b) firms and companies registered outside Sri Lanka; (c) Sri Lanka nationals resident outside Sri Lanka, who are classified for this purpose into two categories (those whose current or savings accounts are redesignated as nonresident accounts following their departure, and those whose accounts are opened after their departure); (d) emigrants; and (e) foreign banks. The opening of these accounts for categories (a) and (b), the crediting of the initial and subsequent deposits arising from inward remittances, and debits for local disbursements may be effected without the prior ap- proval of the Department of Exchange Control; however, local credits to these accounts and debits for remittances abroad require the prior approval of the Department. The opening and redesignating of accounts in category (c), credits arising from inward remittances, and local credits and debits to such accounts may be effected without the prior approval of the Department of Exchange Control; debits of these accounts for remittances abroad without exchange control approval are not permitted.' Accounts in category (d) are designated in the first instance as nonresident blocked accounts only when instructions to that effect are received from the Department of Ex- change Control. Local debits to such accounts may be effected without the prior approval of the Department of Exchange Control; however, local credits to them and debits for outward remittances require the prior approval of the Department. Under category (e) foreign banks may be permitted to open and operate nonresident accounts without the prior approval of the Department of Exchange Control. Nonresident blocked accounts are used for holding funds that have not been accepted for transfer abroad, usually funds owned by nonresidents, repatriates, and emigrants. Authorized dealers are permitted to debit these accounts for local disbursements and credit them on account of pensions, income tax re funds, and profits and dividends without prior approval. Funds in blocked accounts may be invested in any local enterprise without the prior approval of the Controller of Exchange.

Remittances up to a max imum of SL Rs 200,000 are allowed from these accounts, without the prior approval of the exchange control authorities. Remittance of interest accrued to blocked accounts is fu l ly transferable after deduction of taxes. Also retained in blocked accounts is a proportion of local currency earnings derived from the exhibition of foreign-owned films; such retained funds may be used by the owner for certain specified purposes, including the making of films in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka nationals resident abroad are allowed to maintain nonresident foreign currency accounts in Sri Lanka in convertible currencies.2 Such accounts can also be opened by Sri Lankans within 90 days of their arrival in Sri Lanka with foreign exchange brought in by them or received from abroad. Credits to the accounts are limited to the proceeds of remittances from abroad and money brought into the country by individuals at the time of arrival; in addition, interest payments in these four convertible currencies may be credited to the accounts. These accounts may be freely debited without exchange control approval for payments abroad or within Sri Lanka converted to Sri Lanka rupees, while the account holder is outside Sri Lanka, and for a period of ten years from the date of arrival of the account holder for taking up permanent residence in Sri Lanka. These accounts are exempt from income and wealth taxes during the period in which the account holder is resident abroad and for a further period of six years after resuming residence in Sri Lanka. Commercial banks operating in Sri Lanka may estab- lish a Foreign Currency Banking Unit. These units may accept time and demand deposits in any designated foreign currency from nonresidents and from resident enterprises in the Investment Promotion Zone, and they may extend loans and advances in any designated foreign currency to any nonresident and to any resident enter- prise having GCEC status. In addition, the Foreign Currency Banking Units are allowed to accept time and demand deposits from and grant loans and advances to any other resident approved by the Central Bank for such purposes as may be approved by the Central Bank. Imports and Import Payments Except for certain specified imports, no prior licensing is required. Imports that are subject to prior licensing include those subject to control for security reasons, precious metals, alcohol, apparatus and equipment used in photographic and cinematographic laboratories, photocopying and thermocopying apparatus, screens for projectors, color photocopying apparatus, articles of cement (whether reinforced or not), concrete cement blocks, encasements of industrial waste slugs, slag dress, ash and residues, other slag and ash including 2In deutsche mark, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, and U .S. dollars. 456 kelp, and certain consumer goods, in addition to several major food items (rice, flour, and wheat grains). Imports of specified items3 are restricted to govern- ment or state corporations; these are referred to as "reserved items." Prior approval procedures apply to certain imports of capital goods: certain machinery imports relating to foreign investment require the ap- proval of the Foreign Investment Advisory Committee, and certain machinery imports relating to local invest- ment require the prior approval of the Local Investment Advisory Committee; no prior approval is required if any single consignment does not exceed SL Rs 700,000. Holders of balances in Convertible Rupee Accounts, which were abolished for new credits as of Novem- ber 16, 1977, may use these funds to pay for certain imports, subject to licensing by the Controller of Imports and Exports. Except for specified transactions, imports can be effected only against sight letters of credit. An autho- rized dealer may approve an application to remit foreign exchange or to credit a nonresident account against an application for the opening of a letter of credit, and proof of a valid import license, when applicable. These requirements do not apply where the value of a consign- ment is less than SL Rs 5,000 and is for the direct use of the importer. Payments for Invisibles Certain payments for invisibles require exchange control permission. For travel abroad, residents of Sri Lanka are allowed a basic foreign exchange allowance of 2,000 Indian rupees an adult and 1,000 Indian rupees a child under 12 years, once every two years, for travel to the "Indian group of countries" (defined as Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burma, India, Maldives, Nepal, and Pakistan); the U .S. dollar or pound sterling equivalents of these amounts may be allowed. In addition, basic allowances of £ stg. 500 for an adult and £ stg. 250 for a child under 12 years of age are allowed every four years for travel to other countries. Additional foreign exchange is provided to pay for air fares. The prior approval by the Central Bank is not required for these sales of exchange, as the function has been delegated to the banks. Allowances for official travel require a certificate from the head of the relevant institution. Banks and travel agents authorized by the Central Bank can also provide foreign exchange for business travel when the request is accompanied by a letter from the chairman, director, partner, or sole proprietor of the company recommending the particular trip abroad. In those cases, exchange is allowed at the rate of US$45 a day, up to a maximum of 30 days, for the Indian group of countries and US$90 a day, also up to a maximum of 30 days, for other destinations. These limits apply to chairmen, directors, partners, and sole proprietors of companies; other business executives may 3These include dates, chilies, onions, potatoes, certain petroleum products, f i lms, consumer textiles, caustic soda, tea chests, ju te hessian, mamoties, and matches. ©International Monetary Fund.

March 23. In order to discourage speculation against the rupee and to speed up the repatriation of export proceeds, the Central Bank stipulated that all exporters availing themselves of the special subsidized refinance facility of the Central Bank should sell forward their entire export proceeds. The duration of the forward contract was to be related to the maturity of the corresponding letter of credit or the latest period of delivery specified in the export contract, but in no event could it exceed a period of six months. At the same time, SRI LANKA importers' access to the forward market was restricted to those of essential imports only. All forward operations were to be conducted through the banking system and the rates freely determined. April 9. In a modification of the six-month limit on the surrender of export proceeds, it was stipulated that for export payments with sight bills or sight letters of credit, the surrender of proceeds should be made w i th in 21 days from the presentation of documents; for payments made with term letters of credit, the surrender should be effected within 21 days from the date of maturity of the letter of credit. In the case of payments made with usance bills (collection on a deferred payment basis), the surrender time limit remained at six months. May 2. Commercial banks were instructed to purchase the forward foreign exchange proceeds of all exports exceeding SL Rs 500,000. May 5.

The regulations on the duration of forward contracts and on importers' access to the forward market remained unchanged. 459 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SUDAN (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Sudan is the Sudanese Pound. There are three exchange markets: (1) the official market, in which the official exchange rate for the Sudanese pound is pegged to the U .S. dollar at US$1 = LSd 1.3, and which handles government transactions effected through the Bank of Sudan; (2) a market operated by authorized banks in which the exchange rate is set in consultation with the Central Bank (at US$1 = LSd 2.1 since October 22, 1984); and (3) a market operated by authorized foreign exchange dealers in which the ex- change rate is allowed to fluctuate. The allocation of specified transactions in these markets is as follows: (1) The exchange rate in the official market covers public sector imports of specified commodities, including, notably, petroleum; repatriation of principal on foreign loans and foreign shares, pro- vided that they are approved by the Minister of Finance and Economic Planning and registered with the Bank of Sudan; the imports of essential drugs by the private sector; public sector debt service payments; 75 percent of the proceeds from cotton and gum arabic exports; and official aid. (2) The exchange rate in the commercial bank market is applied for certain transactions by the Bank of Sudan as well as for all transactions by the commercial banks, namely: all invisible and capital receipts and payments not eligible for the official exchange rate and not conducted with currency notes converted with foreign exchange dealers, all export proceeds other than the portion of cotton and gum arabic export proceeds converted at the official rate, all imports of commodity aid, and other private sector imports financed with export proceeds. (3) The exchange rate in the foreign exchange dealers' market covers currency notes an^d traveler's checks, the principal source being workers' remittances and the principal demand being for importation by the private sector. Transactions with Egypt, with which Sudan maintains a bilateral payments agreement, are excluded from the above-mentioned regulations, with the exception of those not covered under the agreement. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Bank of Sudan, with the assistance of the authorized banks. Foreign exchange dealers are authorized only to buy and sell foreign currencies in the free market. The issuance of registration forms and the licensing of imports and exports (except those of gold) are the responsibility of the Ministry of Cooperation, Commerce, and Supply, but all registration forms and licenses pertaining to transactions in the official market must be validated by the Bank of Sudan. Official import payments and other foreign payments are approved within the framework of an annual foreign exchange budget drawn up by the 460 Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, in coordi- nation w i th the Bank of Sudan and the Ministry of Cooperation, Supply, and Commerce. Prescription of Currency Payments to all countries —except Egypt, with which, as mentioned above, Sudan maintains a bilateral pay- ments agreement —and all monetary areas (the "convert- ible area") may be made in Sudanese pounds to the credit of any nonresident account or in any foreign currency, while receipts from the "convertible area" may be accepted in Sudanese pounds from any nonresident account or in any convertible currency. Foreign Currency Accounts There are two types of foreign currency accounts: (a) foreign exchange accounts held by residents, on which there are no restrictions, residents being free to hold foreign currency in cash, except that they are not allowed to settle their domestic transactions in foreign currency; and (b) special accounts, applicable to the organizations and diplomatic entities specified in the last category of invisible receipts under Exchange Arrange- ment, above. All such bodies and their staff are required to keep their foreign currency in special accounts which are to be maintained only from inward transfers; any conversion from such accounts into Sudanese pounds, in order to settle domestic transactions, should be effected at the official rate, and checks drawn on the accounts are permitted only to pay for airline tickets, purchases at duty-free shops, and hotel bills. Drawing of cash from these accounts is allowed only for travel expenditures, but outward transfers from them are free. Interest payments on current bank accounts denominated in foreign currencies are prohibited. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Certain imports are prohibited for protective reasons and others are not being licensed. Permitted imports are financed from four sources according to category: (1) from the Bank of Sudan for essential imports; (2) from commercial bank resources only for certain commodities; (3) from either commercial bank or private resources; and (4) from private resources for all other commodities. Import licenses are issued according to these categories. Petroleum products are imported only by a state agency. For goods that require individual licensing, import licenses must be obtained from the Ministry of Coopera- tion, Commerce, and Supply, but for those goods that are imported through the official market the licenses must be validated by the General Administration for Foreign Exchange (GAFE).

Most private sector imports are subject to an advance deposit of 2 percent of the c. & f. value, payable before validation, if the import is financed by commer- cial banks. Goods that otherwise would be subject to the advance deposit requirement are exempt when financed with suppliers' credit of at least two years' maturity, provided that the amount of the transaction is at least LSd 500,000. If a letter of credit is opened, the authorized bank usually requires a cash margin of 40 percent. In practice, for many import items for which the banks are not allowed to provide foreign exchange financing, a margin deposit of 100 percent is required. A stamp duty of LSd 5 is levied on the application form for each transfer in respect of private sector imports. Most imports are subject to an import surcharge of 10 percent and a defense tax of 10 percent ad valorem. There are arrears on payments for imports. Payments for Invisibles Payments for all invisibles financed from free market sources do not require approval from the GAFE. Repatri- ation of loan principal and shares require approval from the GAFE, as these are financed from foreign exchange funds purchased by commercial banks at the official rate, on behalf of the Bank of Sudan. Allowances for tourist travel to Egypt are authorized by the commercial banks up to a maximum of LSd 300 a person a year in clearing dollars. In addition, travelers to Egypt are free to acquire convertible currency from the free market. Foreign exchange for travel to countries other than Egypt must be acquired from the free market. Departing travelers must provide evidence that foreign exchange in their posses- sion was acquired through a commercial bank exchange dealer, or a private licensed exchange dealer, drawn from a foreign exchange or special account, or has been reported on a declaration form prior to entry into Sudan. The exportation of Sudanese currency over LSd 20 is prohibited. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. With the exception of cotton, gum arabic, and livestock, all exporters must submit for all exports an export contract accompanied by an export license and obtain approval from an authorized commercial bank. All commodities are subject to m in imum export prices. The proceeds of exports must be repatriated to the banking system within four months from the date of ship- ment. The commercial banks are allowed to purchase 25 percent of export proceeds at the free market rate to meet the needs of the private sector, in accordance with the priority list established by the Bank of Sudan; the balance of 75 percent of export proceeds must be surrendered to the Bank of Sudan at the official exchange rate. When the terms of payment are cash against documents or sight letter of credit, the proceeds must be SUDAN surrendered on delivery of the sh ipp ing documents; otherwise a surrender date is u su a l ly specified. Some major export commodities are exported solely by pub l ic sector entities. Proceeds from Invisibles Sudanese nationals working abroad can open foreign exchange accounts. Residents are allowed to keep foreign exchange from sources other than export pro- ceeds or income from tourism; such foreign exchange can be kept in foreign exchange accounts with local or foreign banks. Travelers entering Sudan may bring in any amount in notes and coin of other currencies, but the importation of more than LSd 20 in Sudanese currency is forbidden. Declaration of foreign exchange holdings at the port of entry is optional but advisable for those who want to repatriate these funds. Capital All incoming foreign capital (loans or equ i ty ), other than bank capital, is converted at the commercial bank rate and receives assurance of repatriation of the original capital at the official rate. Foreign exchange for remit- tances of profits, interest, and dividends is to be acquired from the commercial bank or free market. Gold Residents may purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in Sudan for numismatic purposes. Subject to certain conditions, residents may also purchase, hold, and sell inSudan domestically produced gold. With these excep- tions, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Ministry of Cooperation, Commerce, and Supply; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. Some newly mined gold is exported for processing and then reimported. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement October 21. The following changes were made in the exchange arrangement: (a) the commercial bank rate was changed from US$1 = LSd 1.8 to US$1 = LSd 2 .1, representing a devaluation of 14.3 percent; (b) a require- ment was introduced that commercial banks should transfer to the Bank of Sudan 50 percent of all export proceeds purchased by them in the commercial bank market, and that all export proceeds from sesame and invisible receipts purchased by the banks in the commer- cial bank market should be transferred in fu ll to the Bank of Sudan; and (c) the percentage exchanged at the commercial bank market from the proceeds of exports other than cotton and gum arabic was increased from 25 percent to 100 percent; in addition, all invisible 461 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SUDAN receipts, incoming foreign capital other than bank capital, all commodity aid, and all current invisible payments by the Government (excluding debt-service payments) were required to be financed through the commercial bank market. Capital February 22. Payment of interest on current bank accounts denominated in foreign currencies was pro- hibited, and regulations were issued further tightening the ban on importation of 39 luxu ry items. 462 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SURINAME (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Suriname is the Suriname Guilder, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at Sf 1.78876 = US$1. On December 31, 1984 the official buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were Sf 1.77 and Sf 1.80, respectively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates for certain other curren- cies l are set daily by the Central Bank on the basis of the market quotations for the U.S. dollar and the currencies concerned in Amsterdam and the central rate for the U .S. dollar in Suriname, net of any commissions. There is no exchange market in Suriname. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Suriname formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agree- ment, as from June 29, 1978. Administration of Control In principle, all foreign exchange transactions are subject to license, as are transactions between residents and nonresidents in domestic currency and other domes- tic assets. The authority to grant exchange licenses is vested in the Foreign Exchange Board, which has delegated much of this authority and issues licenses mainly for capital transactions and certain invisibles. An interministerial ad hoc committee under the auspices of the Ministry of Transport, Trade, and Industry grants import licenses. Export licenses are granted by the Ministry of Transport, Trade, and Industry. The Central Bank is empowered to provide foreign exchange for import payments (subject to presentation of an import license); the latter authority is exercised through the commercial banks, which have all been appointed as authorized banks by the Foreign Exchange Board. The authorized banks are empowered to provide foreign exchange for specified current payments without requir- ing an exchange license. They may also accept free of license those inward transfers of foreign exchange that do not result from borrowing abroad; the taking up of foreign loans is subject to approval by the Foreign Exchange Board. Except in the circumstances specified above, the authorized banks are not permitted to sell foreign exchange without the submission of an exchange license by the remitter. Prescription of Currency Settlements in Suriname guilders between Suriname and foreign countries are not permitted; they must, in general, be made in convertible currencies.2 Deutsche mark, French francs, Netherlands guilders, and pounds sterling. 2Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Barbados dollars, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Eastern Caribbean dollars, French francs, Guyana dollars, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, Trinidad and Tobago dollars, and U .S. dollars. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents, whether banks or nonbanks, may freely open accounts in U .S. dollars with domestic banks; no overdrafts are permitted. Nonresidents other than banks may freely open accounts in Suriname guilders with domestic banks; certain debits and credits are covered by a general license, while all others are subject to a specific license. These accounts must not be overdrawn and, for certain specified purposes, debits must not exceed a total of Sf 3,000 a month. Authorized banks may open nonresident accounts in Suriname guilders in the name of nonresident banks; these accounts also must not be overdrawn. Authorized banks may open nonresident accounts on behalf of nonresidents drawing pensions from the Government or under company plans. Transfers of up to Sf 1,500 a month may be effected under a general permit, and additional amounts may be trans- ferred under a special permit. Nonresident accounts in guilders may not be credited with Suriname bank notes mailed from abroad; nonresident foreign currency ac- counts may not be credited with Surinamese tender. Imports and Import Payments Import licenses are required for all imports.3 Imports of some commodities are prohibited,4 and imports of another group of commodities are subject to quotas under the Comprehensive Decree of May 11, 1982.5 By arrangement with a Swiss firm (the Societe Generate de Surveillance (SGS)), the authorities monitor invoicing of imports and exports. A government agency, the Suriname Central Import Service, acts as the main 3 However, two specified mining companies do not need licenses for their own import requirements. Similar exemptions may be granted to foreign companies for their industrial activities in Suriname, provided that they pay for their imports from their own foreign exchange holdings. 4The prohibition applies to imports of pigs (excluding those for breeding), chicken, duck, and turkey meat, pork, f ish, shrimp, and crab —fresh, cooled or frozen, salted, dried or precooked (excluding kwie-kwie fish and smoked herring) —vegetables (excluding potatoes, onions, and garlic), edible roots and tubers, citrus, bananas, plantains, and coconuts, green and roasted coffee, (excluding decaffeinated), rice and rice products (excluding baby food), sugar (excluding cubes and tablets weighing 5 grams or less a cube or tablet), aromatized or colored sugar or sugar syrup, noodles and macaroni, jam, je l ly, and marmalade (excluding those for diabetics), peanut butter, syrups, and concentrates for nonalcoholic beverages in packages of less than 5 kilograms (excluding those for diabetics), firewood and other nonprocessed wood, railroad ties, shingles, wooden structures for construction, wooden tiles and panels, wooden tools, handles, and coat hangers, men's and boy's shoes (excluding rubber and plastic boots and sport shoes), and sand, gravel, sidewalk tiles, and road bricks. Imports of some other items such as specified explosives and narcotics, are prohibited for reasons of public policy or health. 5 The commodities to which import quotas are applied include kwie- kwie f ish, milk powder, potatoes, onions and garlic, fruits and nuts (other than citrus, bananas, plantains, and coconuts), decaffeinated coffee, peanuts, baby food, tomato paste, and certain preserved vegetables, matches, furn ish ings, and ready-made clothing, and furniture made of wood, metal, bamboo or other materials (excluding those for business establishments such as offices, theaters, clinics, hotels, restaurants, and libraries). 463 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SURINAME importer of staple foodstuffs and some other com- modities. Import prices for food products imported by other companies are checked against quotations collected by the Suriname Central Import Service. The import license serves as a general authorization for payment, but payment by letter of credit must be approved by the Minister of Finance. Import licenses have a validity of six months, within which period the goods must be landed and paid for. A license fee of 1.5 percent and a statistical fee of 1.5 percent are levied on the c . i .f. value of all imports, including imports of gold. Payments for Invisibles Transactions involving outward remittances of foreign exchange are subject to licensing; application for a license must be made at least one month prior to the intended date for effecting such a transaction. Autho- rized banks and the General Post Office have authority to provide foreign exchange up to Sf 150 an item a month on account of certain services (bank charges, legal fees, membership dues, copy and patent rights, and so forth), as well as for advertising expenses and payments for books. Travel allowances for residents are subject to licensing and are limited to the equivalent of Sf 100 a person for each trip, and a maximum of Sf 200 a person a calendar year for travel to Guyana and French Guiana; and Sf 500 a person a calendar year for travel to other countries (50 percent of these amounts for children under 12 years). The authorized bank must enter on the travel ticket the amount of foreign exchange sold and the date, the purchase of exchange for travel not being permitted until three days before departure. Bona fide applications for larger amounts of exchange for travel purposes are approved on a case-by-case basis. Both resident and nonresident travelers may take out Sf 100 in Suriname currency. The export by resident travelers of foreign bank notes is limited to the amount of their travel allowance. Remittances for support of family members in the Netherlands Antilles or in the Netherlands require an individual license, which is granted only for full-time registered students of disciplines essential to but not taught in Suriname. Payments due as interest on loans and as net income from other investments, and payments of moderate amounts for amortization of loans or depreciation of direct investments, may be made if an application, supported by an auditor's report, is duly presented to the Foreign Exchange Board for verification. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports require export licenses, which for most commodities are issued freely, provided that the exporter undertakes to surrender the foreign currency proceeds to an authorized bank within six months of shipment. Export licenses for cattle, pigs, fresh beef and pork, and planting materials are granted only with the advice of the Director of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and 464 Fisheries. The export of baboonwood is prohibited, and that of rice is subject to special regulations. Certain exporting companies have received special permission from the Foreign Exchange Board to maintain current accounts in foreign currency with their parent companies abroad and to use these for specified payments and receipts (including export proceeds). Export of logs are subject to a tax of 10 percent to 50 percent of f .o .b. value, depending on the type of wood; and exports of rough-hewn timber are subject to a tax of 10 percent of f .o .b. value. All exports are subject to a statistical fee of 1.5 percent of the f .o .b. value. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange receipts from invisibles must be surrendered to an authorized bank. Travelers may bring in foreign currency without limit and up to Sf 100 in domestic currency. Travelers must declare all domestic and foreign currency in their possession on entry; resident travelers must exchange at an authorized bank any foreign currency in their possession. The amount which nonresidents may take out of the country in foreign currency must be smaller than the amount brought in and declared on entry. All nonresident travelers are required to exchange convertible currency in an amount equivalent to Sf 500 when entering Suriname at Zanderij International Airport and Sf 200 when entering by road at Nickerie or Albina. Unspent balances of such guilders can be reconverted into convertible currency provided that the visit was shorter than ten days in each case and the visitor spent more than Sf 50 a day. Capital A decision of September 21, 1960 of the Foreign Exchange Board provides for the transfer abroad of capital proceeds from the sale to residents or the liquidation of fu l ly or partly foreign-owned companies or other forms of enterprise. The decision covers invest- ments made by nonresidents with foreign capital after July 31, 1953. It also provides for the annual transfer of profits and for the transfer at any time of the foreign exchange (including loans) imported by the nonresident entrepreneur for the company's use. Profits must be transferred within three years; otherwise, they are con- sidered to have become part of the f i rm 's working capital and may only be transferred in annual installments of 20 percent. An investment law provides additional incentives for private investment. The Foreign Exchange Board may, at its discretion, grant licenses for transfers abroad from a deceased's estate, up to a maximum of Sf 10,000. For estates of more than Sf 10,000, further annual transfers are permitted so as to spread them over a period not exceeding ten years. The Board may allow emigrants (heads of family) to transfer in foreign exchange the equivalent of Sf 5,000 in a lump sum, and subsequently Sf 5,000 a year. The head of a repatriating family may be permitted to transfer the equivalent of Sf 10,000 plus ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 10 percent of his total taxable earnings in Suriname accrued during his period of residence; if his Surinamese assets exceed the sum thus calculated, the excess may be transferred at a rate of Sf 10,000 a year. Transfers abroad in excess of Sf 10,000 a year may be authorized under exceptional circumstances. Subject to certain requirements, residents may pur- chase or sell in specified countries6 Surinamese corpo- rate shares that have been designated as negotiable by the Foreign Exchange Board. Transfers for investment abroad or for the purchase of other foreign securities or real estate by residents are not permitted, although exceptions may be made for direct investments abroad when it is considered that Surinamese interests will benefit. All borrowing from nonresidents by nonbank residents requires prior approval by the Foreign Ex- change Board. The foreign transactions of authorized banks are restricted, in principle, to those undertaken for the account of their customers, and banks are required, in principle, to surrender to the Central Bank any excess of foreign currency purchased. Authorized banks are permitted to place a part of their liquid funds abroad and to use the short-term credit lines extended by their foreign correspondent banks as a source of operating funds. Following curtailment of such credit lines in early 1983, the Central Bank, the authorized banks, and the correspondent banks have made an arrangement whereby the Central Bank guarantees the letters of credit issued by the authorized banks by pledging its balances up to a specified ceiling, while the authorized banks keep their balances abroad at a minimum level.7 The ceiling on the outstanding letters of credit guaranteed by reserve pledges amounts to the equivalent of US$14.6 million; the authorized banks have generally been able to honor their letters of credit so that the pledged central bank balances have not so far been drawn upon. The autho- rized banks have a general license to place abroad in short-term U.S. dollar assets the amounts corresponding to balances in their nonresident U .S. dollar accounts. Gold Producers of gold may sell only to authorized gold buyers. Locally produced gold must be surrendered to the Foreign Exchange Board by sale to the Central Bank at a price closely related to the world market price. Authorized gold buyers are permitted, however, to sell nuggets at freely agreed prices to the public for industrial and artistic purposes; dealings between residents in gold bars and other forms of unworked gold, with the exception of nuggets, are prohibited. As local production does not meet demand for industrial purposes, the Central Bank imports some gold, which it sells to authorized gold buyers. 6Belgium, Canada, France, Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Netherlands Antilles, United Kingdom, and United States. 7 This arrangement applies to the nationally controlled De Surinaamsche Bank and Hakrinbank and not to the Dutch-owned Algemene Bank Nederland. SURINAME Two kinds of gold coin, one with a face value of Sf 100 and the other Sf 200, are legal tender. Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Suriname for numismatic and investment purposes; authorized banks may freely negotiate gold coin among themselves and with other residents. Residents other than the monetary authorities, producers of gold, and authorized industrial and dental users are not allowed without special permis- sion to hold or acquire gold in any form other than nuggets, jewelry, or coin, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require exchange licenses issued by the Foreign Ex- change Board; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports of coin by authorized banks and for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, producers of gold, and industrial users. Residents arriving from abroad, however, may freely bring in gold, subject to declaration and provided that they surrender it to the Central Bank within 20 days. Nonresident travelers also may freely bring in gold, subject to declaration; they may re-export the declared amount freely. Imports of gold coin are duty free and those of un worked gold are subject to a duty of Sf 1.00 a gram, irrespective of origin. The general tariff for gold orna- ments is 60 percent ad valorem. Imports and exports of all forms of gold are subject to the statistical fee of 1.5 percent; in addition, imports are subject to a licensing fee of 1.5 percent. Changes During 1984 Imports and Import Payments April 2. The advance deposit requirement for imports was abolished. Payments for Invisibles January 15. Authorization for residents to remit gifts up to Sf 300 a year to beneficiaries abroad was revoked. February 1. Authorization for residents to make outward remittances for support of their family members in the Netherlands Antilles or in the Netherlands was revoked; all such remittances would henceforth require individual licenses, which would be granted only for registered full-time students of disciplines essential to but not taught in Suriname. June 1. Foreign exchange allowances for foreign travel were reduced to the equivalent of Sf 200 a person a trip (up to a maximum of Sf 400 a person a calendar year) for travel to Guyana and French Guiana, and Sf 750 a person a calendar year for travel to all other countries. (The limit in each case for children under 12 years was fixed at 50 percent of adult allowances.) December 1. Foreign exchange allowances for foreign travel were reduced further to the equivalent of Sf 100 a person a trip (up to a maximum of Sf 200 a person a calendar year) for travel to Guyana and French Guiana, and Sf 500 a person a calendar year for travel to all other countries. (The limit in each case for children under 12 years was fixed at 50 percent of adult allowances.) 465 ©International Monetary Fund.

Not for Redistribution SWAZILAND (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Swaziland is the Lilangeni (plural emalangeni), which is pegged to the South African rand at E 1 = R 1. Exchange rates for the U.S. dollar quoted by the Central Bank of Swaziland are based on the floating middle rate of the South African rand against the U .S. dollar. Buying and selling margins, as in South Africa, are held within 0.25 percent (US$0.0029) of the middle rate. On December 31, 1984 the official buying and selling rates were US$0.5045 and US$0.5035, respectively, per E 1. Rates are also quoted for the deutsche mark, the French franc, the pound sterling, and the Swiss franc, based on the London and New York market quotations for these currencies against the U.S. dollar, and for the Kenya shilling and the Zambian kwacha, based on their relationship to the SDR. The Central Bank of Swaziland will also quote rates for the currencies of member states of the Preferential Trade Area of Eastern and Southern African States, based on the relationship with the SDR as advised by the Clearing House operated by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Exchange Control Territory Swaziland forms part of the Rand Monetary Area, which is a single exchange control territory comprising Lesotho, South Africa, and Swaziland. No restrictions are applied to payments within the Rand Monetary Area, and in principle, these are not controlled. In relation to countries outside the Rand Monetary Area, Swaziland applies exchange controls that are generally similar to those of South Africa. There are no bilateral payments arrangements. Administration of Control The Central Bank of Swaziland, on behalf of the Ministry of Finance, controls all external currency transactions. Imports and Import Payments Swaziland is a member of a customs union with Botswana, Lesotho, and South Africa, and there are no import restrictions on goods originating in any country of the customs union. Imports from South Africa do not require licenses and include an unknown quantity of goods originating outside the customs union. Insofar as Swaziland imports goods directly from countries outside the customs un ion, such imports are usua l ly licensed in conformity with South Afr ica's import regulations. Import licenses are valid for all countries and entitle the holder to buy the foreign exchange required to make the import payment. Exports and Export Proceeds Certain exports are subject to licensing. When export- ing, a declaration must be made that the proceeds w i ll be repatriated in the prescribed manner and within the stipulated period. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments to nonresidents for current transactions, while subject to control, are not normally restricted. Authority to approve some types of current payments is delegated to authorized dealers up to established limits. The basic exchange allowance for tourist travel to neighboring countries is E 2,000 an adult, and E 1,000 a child, a year; the corresponding annual allowance for tourist travel to other countries is E 6,000 and E 3,000, respectively. For business travel to neighboring coun- tries, the basic annual allowance is E 4,000 a person at rates not exceeding E 400 a day; the corresponding limits for business travel to other countries are E 10,000 and E 500, respectively. A higher basic allowance can be obtained for business and medical travel. To use credit cards outside the Rand Monetary Area, a resident cardholder must complete a letter of undertaking prior to departure. Capital Inward capital transfers should be properly docu- mented in order to facilitate the subsequent repatriation of interest, dividends, profits, and other income. No person may borrow foreign currency or register shares in the name of a nonresident, or act as a nominee for a nonresident, without prior approval. Applications for most outward transfers of capital are considered on their merits. Blocked emalangeni may be invested in quoted securities and other such investments as may be approved by the Central Bank. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement February 1. Swaziland formally became a member of the Preferential Trade Area of Eastern and Southern African States. 467 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SWEDEN (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Sweden is the Swedish Krona. In managing the exchange rate of the krona, the Sveriges Riksbank (the central bank) is guided by a trade- weighted index based on a basket of 15 currencies of Sweden's most important trading partners. In construct- ing the index the Swedish authorities established two criteria to be met by each country and currency included in the basket: (1) the country had to account for at least 1 percent of Sweden's total foreign trade (exports plus imports) during the previous five-year period and (2) each currency had to be quoted daily on the foreign exchange market in Stockholm. The weights are propor- tional to Sweden's foreign trade with each of the countries whose currencies are included in the index, with the exception that the weight of the U .S. dollar has been doubled and that of the other currencies adjusted accordingly. To take account of changes in average trade shares the weights are adjusted each year (on April 1) on the basis of trade statistics for the last five calendar years. At present, the weights are as follows (base period 1979-83): U .S. dollar Deutsche mark Pound sterling Norwegian krone Danish krone Finnish markka French franc Netherlands guilder Belgian franc Italian lira Japanese yen Swiss franc Austrian schilling Spanish peseta Canadian dollar Total 19.1 16.2 13.2 9.4 8.2 7.2 5.5 5.1 3.8 3.6 2.7 2.2 1.5 1.2 1.1 100.0 The index value of 132 represents the benchmark for the effective value following the devaluation on Octo- ber 8, 1982 (August 29,1977 = 100). The exchange rate is managed so as to allow only limited fluctuations around this benchmark. An average of the daily index values is published weekly by the Riksbank. The market buying and selling rates for spot transactions in U .S. dollars, the intervention currency, on December 31,1984 were SKr 8.9870 and SKr 8.9920, respectively, per US$1. Spot rates for other currencies are established on the basis of the cross rates in international markets. Forward market rates are left to the interplay of market forces. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Authorized banks may buy from and sell to other 468 authorized banks any foreign currency on a spot basis against another foreign currency or Swedish kronor. They may also purchase foreign currencies, spot, from- foreign banks and other nonresidents against any foreign currency or Swedish kronor credited to an External Kronor Account (see section on Nonresident Accounts, below). They may sell foreign currencies, spot, to foreign banks and other nonresidents against any other foreign currency or Swedish kronor debited to an External Kronor Account. Authorized banks may conclude with residents other than banks forward exchange transactions in foreign currencies against Swedish kronor covering current and authorized payments for (1) unlimited periods in respect of receipts on the one hand, and payments for imports, freight, and charter services on the other; (2) periods not exceeding 12 months in respect of repayment of loans abroad for refinancing of credits granted in Swedish kronor in connection with Swedish exports; and (3) 6 months in respect of other payments. Forward transactions may be concluded only to cover payments for which an agreement exists. However, export firms, when tendering, may make forward sales of settlement on the envisaged date of payment or on the expiry date for tendering. A bank may not credit a customer with any profit on canceled forward transactions. Under specified conditions, Swedish residents who have raised loans in foreign currency may buy forward the currency of the loan against another foreign currency. Authorized banks may buy from and sell to other authorized banks, forward, any foreign currency against another foreign currency or Swedish kronor. Authorized banks may buy from or sell to foreign banks, on a forward basis, any foreign currency against another foreign currency or Swedish kronor for a period not exceeding 12 months. Such transactions with foreign banks may, however, be for periods exceeding 12 months if made in cover of forward transactions with residents. Sweden formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from February 15, 1961. Administration of Control Exchange controls are administered by the Riksbank through its Exchange Control Board. Authorized banks and certain other authorized agencies implement the ex- change control regulations. All current payments are exempt from exchange control provided that they are made through authorized banks. These banks have also been granted general licenses to approve various pay- ments that are subject to exchange control. When re- quired, import and export licenses are issued by the Board of Commerce, except for foodstuffs, which are issued by the National Agricultural Marketing Board, ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution and for gold and gold alloys, which are issued by the Riksbank. Prescription of Currency Payments to and from foreign countries may be made in any foreign currency or in Swedish kronor through an External Kronor Account (see section on Nonresident Accounts, below). Nonresident Accounts There are two main types of nonresident accounts held in Swedish kronor: External Kronor Accounts and Restricted Accounts. External Kronor Accounts may be held with autho- rized banks by nonresidents domiciled abroad. They may be credited with authorized payments to foreign coun- tries by residents, transfers from other External Kronor Accounts, and sales of any foreign currency. They may be debited for authorized payments to residents, trans- ferred to any other External Kronor Account and may be used for conversion into any foreign currency. They do not normally bear interest. Restricted Accounts are held by persons who have become nonresidents after emigrating. The accounts may be credited with, for example, earnings and proceeds from sales of assets in Sweden, inheritances and amorti- zation on loans granted before emigration, or with funds from Restricted Accounts. Balances in Restricted Ac- counts may be used for payments in Sweden for such items as expenses related to assets in Sweden, mainte- nance costs, purchase of Swedish securities and real estate in Sweden, and loans to residents. Imports and Import Payments With the exception of some agricultural and fishery products, practically all goods are free from quantitative restriction and import licensing when imported from countries other than Albania, Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, the German Demo- cratic Republic, Hungary, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, the U.S.S.R., and Viet Nam. However, most imports from these countries are liberalized. Imports of certain textile products from some countries and territories (Brazil, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Macao, Malaysia, Malta, Mauritius, Pakistan, the Phil- ippines, Portugal, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan,t Thai- land, and Yugoslavia) are limited through special ar- rangements. In addition, imports of specified textiles and garments from any source other than EC countries (except Greece) or EFTA countries (except Portugal), Greenland and the Faeroe Islands, as well as imports of most iron and steel products from all countries, are subject to import licensing for surveillance purposes. Payments for imports may, as current payments, be made freely through an authorized bank. Importers are also permitted to accept foreign suppliers' credits, provided that such credits are regarded as customary. tSee Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part Two, page 54. SWEDEN Payments for Invisibles Invisible payments that are considered as current may be made by residents in favor of nonresidents without restrictions, provided that they are made through an authorized bank. Occasional payments not exceeding the equivalent of SKr 3,000 are considered current regard- less of the purpose. Foreign exchange for travel abroad may be allocated by authorized banks and other autho- rized agencies up to an amount considered reasonable in light of the purpose and duration of the journey. Each person leaving Sweden may take out Swedish bank notes and coin up to SKr 6,000. Nonresidents leaving Sweden may export freely foreign bank notes and other means of payment which have been acquired abroad or from an authorized bank or other authorized agency in Sweden. While abroad, residents may open accounts abroad, provided that at the end of the stay the balance is transferred to Sweden. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to the People's Democratic Republic of Korea, as well as exports of special steel to the United States, are subject to export licensing. All exports, with some exceptions such as ships and scrap metal, are free from license. Proceeds from exports of goods may be sold to an authorized bank for kronor or kept in a foreign currency account with an authorized bank and used by the holder to make authorized payments abroad. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles are subject to the same treatment as those from exports (see section on Exports and Export Proceeds, above). Each person entering Sweden may, for traveling expenses, bring in unlimited amounts of bank notes, coin, and other means of payment. Capital The various categories of capital transactions are governed by specific regulations as follows: (a) Direct investments. A permit from the Riksbank is required for direct investments abroad by residents. It is always granted, sometimes on condition that it should be financed by a loan in a foreign currency abroad with an average maturity of at least five years. New investment in South Africa and Namibia has been banned since July 1, 1979. Foreign direct investments in Sweden require a permit from the Riksbank, which is always given. Investments below SKr 5 million may be financed with domestic credit, as may up to 50 percent of individual investments beyond that amount. (b) Loans. Swedish exporters and importers are normally authorized to raise foreign-currency loans abroad or from an authorized bank in order to finance suppliers' credits and imports, respectively. Loans with a life of up to six months can be obtained from an 469 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SWEDEN authorized bank without a special permit from the Riksbank, provided that the purpose is to finance exports or imports of goods. Authorized banks may conse- quently raise loans abroad in foreign currency for on- lending to enterprises for that purpose. The granting of government-subsidized credits, which AB Svensk Exportkredit administers, can be arranged in accordance with general exemptions issued by the Riksbank. Enterprises and local governments may raise medium- or long-term loans in foreign currency abroad or from an authorized bank provided the average life of the loans is at least two years; loans not exceeding SKr 10 million can be raised by enterprises and local governments without a permit from the Riksbank. Loans to finance authorized direct investments abroad must have an average life of at least five years. (See Section (a), above.) Residents are not normally permitted to extend finan- cial loans to nonresidents. However, upon application, authorized banks are permitted to extend to the foreign counterpart of a Swedish exporter or importer credit intended to finance import and export transactions, and to refinance such credit through a corresponding foreign borrowing. (c) Transactions in securities. Residents do not need authorization to sell portfolio holdings of foreign securi- ties to nonresidents. The purchase of foreign securities from nonresidents by residents is as a rule not permitted. However, authorized banks and stockbrokers may on behalf of residents purchase from nonresidents foreign securities and listed Swedish securities denominated in foreign currencies if payment is made with proceeds from sales to nonresidents of Swedish-held securities denominated in a foreign currency and the purchase is made within six months of the corresponding sale. A general license permits the repurchase from abroad of listed Swedish securities denominated in kroner, pro- vided that a bona fide nonresident ownership is con- firmed by an affidavit or by registration with the Securities Register Center. Authorized banks and stockbrokers may handle pur- chases by nonresidents of listed Swedish securities expressed in Swedish kronor if the payment is made with the proceeds from sales of other similar securities to residents and if certain other conditions are fulfilled. The Riksbank is also prepared to authorize sales to nonresi- dents of listed Swedish shares if the sale is judged to be beneficial for export sales or for capital supply of the company concerned or if it is considered that there are special reasons. (d) Recreational dwellings. Residents may, on appli- cation, transfer abroad up to SKr 250,000 a family to purchase a recreational dwelling. (e) Emigration. When emigrating a resident is per- mitted, on application, to transfer up to SKr 200,000. The remainder of an emigrant's funds may be transferred after confirmation by the tax authorities that the emigrant is no longer residing in Sweden. 470 (f) Other transfers. Authorized banks may approve payments abroad in respect of various categories of remittances (including g if ts), up to SKr 5,000 a calendar year. Transfers to nonresidents on account of inheritance are permitted. Residents may, without a permit from the Riksbank, accept capital receipts from abroad related to such purposes as life pensions, annuity contracts, con- tractual amortizations, the sales of foreign securities and real estate abroad, g if ts, and inheritances. Ceilings are placed on the net foreign exchange holdings of each authorized bank. Banks may grant only normal overdrafts to nonresidents, and may incur foreign exchange liabilities, including a net liability in any one currency within individual limits set for each bank. This, together with the permission to pay interest on foreign exchange deposits held by nonresidents, enables the banks to borrow foreign currency from nonresidents for on-lending (but not in the form of kronor) to foreign banks. Swedish banks may, within individual limits set for each bank, borrow abroad freely in order to sell the proceeds against Swedish kronor in the market. Under certain conditions they may be granted permission to borrow abroad to relend in Sweden (see above). Nonresi- dents' holdings of kronor in External Kronor Accounts must not be "abnormal," and, with minor exceptions, they cannot earn interest. Gold Gold in any form may be held, purchased, and sold within Sweden. However, imports and exports of gold and gold alloys require licenses issued by the Riksbank. Import licenses are normally granted to jewelers, dental laboratories, and to industrial users. No licenses are issued for the import of gold to be held on private account. Exports of waste and scrap of gold require licenses issued by the National Board of Trade. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement April 1. The Bank of Sweden announced new weights for 12 of the 15 currencies in the basket peg for the Swedish krona, on the basis of the average share of each country in Sweden's foreign trade over the preceding five calendar years. Imports and Import Payments January 1. Restrictions on imports of rubber boots were abolished. March 7. Imports of certain textile products from Turkey were placed under restraint for a period of six months (extended to twelve months on September 21, 1984). In addition, it was decided that negotiations on a new bilateral textile agreement would continue. April 1. Restrictions on imports of china tableware from Japan were lifted. October 8. It was announced that the final three of eight agreed tariff reductions under the Tokyo Round would be implemented on January 1, 1985, two years earlier than originally planned. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SWEDEN Capital January 1. With a view to restraining the volume of official export financing within the framework of the OECD consensus system, the Swedish Government added 2 percentage points to lending rates for export credit in domestic currency supplied by the semiofficial export credit agency. (The penalty rate on foreign currency export credits was left unchanged at 0.5 per- centage points over consensus rates.) February 21. The minimum required maturity for foreign currency borrowing abroad or from an authorized bank by enterprises and local governments was changed from at least five years on average (and for amounts of at least SKr 10 million, with the exception of borrowings for some specified purposes) to at least two years. The minimum term for loans for financing of direct invest- ments abroad was left unchanged at five years. May 22. In a further modification of the February 21, 1984 regulation mentioned above, the requirement that the amount of the loan be at least SKr 10 million was abolished, together with the exception of borrowings for some specified purposes. 471 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SWITZERLAND1 (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Switzerland is the Swiss Franc. The Swiss National Bank does not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions; exchange rates are determined, in principle, on the basis of underlying demand and supply conditions in the exchange markets. However, the Swiss National Bank reserves the right to intervene if and when warranted by prevailing circum- stances. The principal intervention currency is the U .S. dollar; ^he market rate for the Swiss franc in terms of the U .S. dollar on December 28, 1984 was Sw F 2.5970 per US$1. All settlements may be made at free market rates. Foreign bank notes are negotiated freely in Switzerland at rates determined by the interplay of supply and demand. Exchange Control Territory For all purposes of import and export the Principality of Liechtenstein is included in the Swiss customs territory. For purposes of exchange control, natural persons domiciled in Liechtenstein are considered by Switzerland as residents and so are juridical persons (including banks), other than letterbox companies, operating business in either country. However, this rule does not apply if the acquisition of Swiss real estate is involved. Liechtenstein is considered a foreign country for purposes of banking supervision. Administration of Control Authority to impose measures for the control of imports, exports, and payments is vested in the Swiss Federal Council acting on the advice of the Federal Department of Public Economy or the Federal Depart- ment of Foreign Affairs. The Swiss National Bank is the advisory and executive authority in matters of currency for both Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Prescription of Currency Settlements may be made or received in any currency. Imports and Import Payments With minor exceptions, imports into Switzerland may be made freely. The importation of butter and alcohol is subject to state control. The most important commodities subject to license, irrespective of their origin, are certain agricultural products, petroleum products, and washing preparations and their compounds. Import permits for goods under license are generally granted freely, but global quotas are established for certain agricultural products. Imports of textiles from specified countries are subject to price surveillance or price certification. Pay- ments for imports from all countries may be made freely. 'Switzerland is not a member of the International Monetary Fund. 472 Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles may be made freely. The export of Swiss and foreign bank notes is unrestricted. Exports and Export Proceeds The export (including re-export) of some goods is subject to export control through individual licenses. This export licensing system is operated in part with the assistance of appropriate semiofficial or private organ- izations. Export proceeds are freely disposable. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles are freely disposable. The import of Swiss and foreign bank notes is unrestricted. Capital Transfers of capital may be made without formality except that bank credits and other bank lending to nonresidents, when amounting to or exceeding Sw F 10 million each and with a maturity of 12 months or more, require permission. Permission is also required for foreign bond issues in Switzerland and for direct partici- pations or subparticipations by Swiss banks in Eurobond issues and Eurocurrency credits; in the case of foreign bond issues, there is a limit of Sw F 200 million an issue. All proposed first placements of medium-term negoti- able paper (notes) in amounts of Sw F 10 million or more must be submitted to the National Bank for authoriza- tion. The National Bank will not approve foreign bond issues with an original maturity of less than eight years; the maturity period for notes is between 18 months and eight years, with a m in imum denomination of Sw F 50,000. This m in imum nominal value may be reduced as a result of partial repayments. Premature repayments of bonds may, in general, be made only after five years, while advance repayments of notes may be made as early as 18 months after placement but not before one half of the overall maturity has elapsed. Notes must remain deposited for the total period of issue with the issuing bank, with a bank that has participated in the issuing syndicate, or with the Swiss Security Clearing Organization (SEGA). The bank requesting authoriza- tion is required to indicate to the National Bank if notes are to be placed exclusively or predominantly w i th foreign governments or monetary authorities. The Na- tional Bank reserves the right in such cases to condition its authorization on a special agreement w i th the foreign authority concerned. Foreign institutions are allowed to participate as sub-underwriters in syndicated Swiss franc capital export transactions provided that they are not mentioned either in the arrangement or pub l ic ly. Credits with multicurrency clauses are subject to the same conditions as those denominated in Swiss francs if the ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Swiss franc is the base currency in the credit arrange- ment. The physical importation and exportation of Swiss and foreign securities other than notes are unrestricted. In 1984 the banks were not subject to reserve require- ments; they are permitted to pay interest on Swiss franc deposits (including "fiduciary" or "trustee" funds) re- ceived from nonresidents. Banks and finance companies are required to report monthly their positions (their own assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, spot and forward) in foreign curren- cies; a select number of them have to report their dealer position on a weekly basis. Swiss banks may participate in loans with multiple currency clauses. Purchases of real estate in Switzerland by or on behalf of persons or firms of foreign nationality who are domiciled or resident abroad require approval by the canton where the property is situated. The approvals of the cantons are subject to supervision and appeal by the Confederation. Gold Swiss gold coins are not legal tender. Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad. There is a free gold market in Zurich. Imports SWITZERLAND and exports of gold in any form by residents and nonresidents are unrestricted and free of license. No customs duties or other charges are levied on exports of gold. Imports of gold bars and of certain gold coins are exempt from customs du ty, but all sales of gold bars and coins within Switzerland are subject to the retail sales tax. An exception is made, however, in certain circum- stances for gold or gold coins purchased by foreign central banks. Import and export licenses, which are issued freely, are required for commercial imports and exports of certain articles containing gold. Changes During 1984 Capital January 1. The queuing system under which a limit of three issues per week was imposed on foreign bond issues was eliminated, and the maximum permissible amount per issue was raised from Sw F 100 million to Sw F 200 million. January 18. In a modification of the deposit require- ment for medium-term notes, the SEGA was made eligible to act as a custodian, in addition to existing custodians consisting of the issuing bank and members of the syndicate. 473 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the Syrian Arab Republic is the Syrian Pound, which is pegged to the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, at LS 3.925 = US$1 in the official market. On April 22, 1981 the Syrian Arab Republic re-established a parallel market along with the official market. A third foreign exchange market (the "tourist market") with a more depreciated rate than the parallel market rate applies to private inward transfers and tourist transactions. The parallel market covers most private transactions, including import payments by the private sector, while the official market covers a large proportion of the transactions of the public sector and specified export transactions of the private sector. The Syrian Arab Republic confines its buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar within LS 3.90 and LS 3.95, respectively, per US$1 in the official market; on Decem- ber 31, 1984 the official buying and selling rates were LS 3.90 and LS 3.95, respectively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates for all major currencies are quoted on the basis of the official market rates, the parallel market rates, and the tourist market rates for the U .S. dollar and the market rates for the currencies concerned in markets abroad.1 Administration of Control Policy with regard to imports and exports is deter- mined by the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade. Under an agreement between the Central Bank of Syria and the Administrative Committee of the Exchange Office, all transactions of the Exchange Office are carried out through the Central Bank. Import licenses are issued by the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade, and exchange licenses for invisibles and capital transac- tions by the Exchange Office. Only authorized commer- cial banks may deal in foreign exchange. The commer- cial banks may open letters of credit only with the prior approval of the Exchange Office. At present there is one authorized bank, the Commercial Bank of Syria, which has been authorized by the Exchange Office to open letters of credit and accept bills for collection without prior approval, provided that certain conditions are fulfilled. Prescription of Currency The Exchange Office is empowered to prescribe the currencies to be obtained for exports. Proceeds of exports to all countries may be obtained in any convert- ible currency, and such proceeds may also be received in bank notes denominated in convertible currencies and declared at the border posts of entry. Prescription of 'Be lg ian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Iraqi dinars, Italian lire, Jordan dinars, Lebanese pounds, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Saudi Arabian riyals, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U .S. dollars. 474 currency requirements are not applied to outgoing payments. All payments to and receipts from Egypt, Israel, and South Africa are prohibited. The Syrian Arab Republic maintains bilateral payments agreements with Sri Lanka, the U .S .S .R ., and Viet Nam; and there is a commercial protocol of commodity exchange with the Islamic Republic of Iran, which is deemed to contain some payments features. Nonresident and Foreign Currency Accounts Nonresident accounts in Syrian pounds may be cred- ited with the proceeds of foreign currencies sold to the authorized bank and with payments for goods. They may be debited without prior approval to pay for Syrian exports to the country of the account holder and for expenses in the Syrian Arab Republic. Residents wishing to open foreign currency accounts are required to present evidence in writing that they have sources of income abroad. Nonresidents (individuals and corporations) may open accounts in convertible foreign currencies at autho- rized local banks for the deposit of funds from abroad. Balances in such accounts may be sold to local banks, transferred abroad without restrictions, or used in pay- ment for specified imports. Temporary nonresident accounts may be opened in the name of nonresidents temporarily resident in the Syrian Arab Republic. These accounts may not be used, however, for funds received in settlement currencies, through payments conventions, or by diplomatic and UN missions and their staffs. Permitted credits include the local currency proceeds of foreign currency brought in at the parallel exchange market rate and amounts corresponding to import pay- ments that are not transferred. Debits for local expendi- tures are completely free, and debits for expenditures abroad also are permitted. Imports and Import Payments Imports of commodities originating in Egypt, Israel, or South Africa are prohibited. Many basic commodities (including green coffee, tea, rice, tobacco, salt, paper, iron and steel, and certain agricultural machinery) are imported only by state-trading agencies or, for their own account, by certain other official agencies. Agencies exclusively qualified to import may import certain commodities to meet the raw material needs of the private sector. Priorities in respect of private sector imports of spare parts, raw materials, and intermediate products are set by an import committee. Imports are divided into two categories: (1) imports prohibited by decree and specified in a Prohibited List, which comprises mostly goods that are produced domes- tically, including some textile products (however, waiv- ers may be granted in order to meet the needs of industry or to obtain supplies of foodstuffs); and (2) all other goods. In principle, imports must come direct from the ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution country of origin, without the intervention of any foreign firm; the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade has the authority, however, to permit certain goods to be imported from countries other than the country of origin. All imports, except those valued at less than LS 2,000 (LS 500 for imports from Lebanon) require licenses which must be obtained by the importer prior to the date of shipment of the goods. Operations of the state-trading agencies are governed by the annual foreign exchange budget. On the basis of the budget, these agencies submit documentation on their import requirements to the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade and the customs authorities, and import licenses are auto- matically issued. Certain imports (not appearing in the list of prohibited imports) from Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia are exempt from license, in accordance with the Arab Common Market Agreement. In such cases an authorization to import is granted in response to a written request. For the private sector, importers are entitled to import specified raw materials, capital goods, consumer goods, and spare parts. The importer submits the import license and the pro forma invoice to the Commercial Bank of Syria, which then opens the letter of credit. Approval by the Exchange Office is not required. A noninterest- bearing advance import deposit is required in order to obtain an import license; the deposits are at rates of 10 percent, 50 percent, and 70 percent of import value. The 10 percent rate of deposit applies to imports of foodstuffs, pharmaceutical and chemical products, and raw materials; deposits of 50 percent are required for imports of construction materials, machinery, and office equipment; and the 70 percent deposit rate applies to all other products. Licenses to import specified items that normally are prohibited (certain luxury consumer goods), up to a value of LS 70,000 in a 12-month period, are granted on request to merchants certified by the Chamber of Commerce and the Ministry of Supply and Internal Trade and whose names appear on the list of payers of income tax published by the Ministry of Finance. No licenses are required for imports in this category where the value does not exceed LS 2,000 an item a month. Foreign currency accounts may be debited freely for import payments, provided that a license is obtained, when necessary. Imports financed from foreign currency obtained abroad are limited to raw materials, production inputs, agricultural and industrial equipment, and spare parts. Such imports are not subject to the waiting list system, nor to the payment of an advance import deposit, provided that the deposits in the local bank have been held for at least three months and that the account holder has stayed at least one year outside the Syrian Arab Republic before opening such an account. There are limited import facilities for travelers arriving from abroad. There is a tax of 2 percent on the issue of import licenses, except for government imports and imports of certain essential items, including raw materials, petro- leum, and petroleum products. In addition, there is a SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC unified import surcharge, which has replaced all the previous special levies on imports (a statistical tax, a consumption tax, a defense tax, a school tax, a maritime transport tax, and a harbor tax). Payments for all imports by the public sector are made at the official market rate solely by letters of credit; payments for all imports by the private sector are made at the parallel market rate and are all required to be settled by letters of credit. Beginning from November 5, 1984, and as a means of facilitating private sector imports, a system is applied under which, upon presentation of a bill or letter from the foreign supplier granting an extended payment term of at least 360 days, anyone holding an import license issued before this date and requesting a letter of credit through the Commercial Bank of Syria (and having lodged the necessary advance deposit in Syrian pounds of 10-70 percent of the total value, depending on the merchandise) may import the merchandise covered by the contract against documents, in accordance with a specified time schedule for the use of import licenses issued prior to that date. Shipping documents for imports under this system must be sent by the exporter directly to the Commercial Bank of Syria, which will deliver them to the importer upon payment of the total amount in Syrian pounds (less the advance deposit) plus 10 percent for the exchange cover. Set- tlement of payment under the arrangement takes place at the time of the bank transfer, that is, within 360 days. Insurance for imports under documentary credit and most private sector imports must be effected locally. Payments for Invisibles Most payments for invisibles must be made at the parallel market rate while trade-related transactions of the public sector and certain other specified payments are made at the official market rate. Both residents and nonresidents may freely take out foreign bank notes. Residents traveling abroad may also take with them other foreign exchange purchased at the tourist market rate as follows: for travel to other Arab countries (except Algeria, Jordan, Lebanon, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Morocco, and Tunisia) and to Cyprus and Turkey, the equivalent of LS 2,500 a trip; and for travel to other countries (including Algeria, the Libyan Arab Jama- hiriya, Morocco, and Tunisia), the equivalent of LS 5,000 a trip. Travelers to Jordan and Lebanon are not eligible for foreign exchange travel allowance, but may take w i th them up to LS 2,000 a trip in Syrian bank notes. For children ten years old or younger, the allowances are 50 percent of these amounts. Workers on secondment to a foreign country may take with them foreign exchange equivalent to 25 percent of the above- mentioned allocations and the entire amount of the allocations on production of proof that they have transferred foreign exchange from abroad. For travel to payments agreement countries, 50 percent of the travel allocation must be taken up through the clearing account concerned (30 percent for travel on official business). On departure, residents of Syrian nationality must pay an 475 ©International Monetary Fund.

Fixed allocations are maintained for other transactions in invisibles, as follows: 60 percent of the salaries received by foreign technicians and experts employed in the Syrian Arab Republic, and 50 percent of the salaries of personnel of foreign diplomatic and international missions in the Syrian Arab Republic. All other transac- tions require the prior approval of the Exchange Office Committee. Nonresidents leaving the country are per- mitted to take out LS 100 in Syrian currency, and residents LS 25. No approvals are granted for additional amounts. Nonresidents leaving the country are allowed to reconvert Syrian currency into foreign exchange up to the equivalent of LS 500 upon showing evidence of having purchased the currency from an official dealer. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of wheat, barley, cotton, cottonseed, and their derivatives are nationalized and are made by the Cereals Office or the Cotton Authority. Exports of petroleum are handled by the Petroleum Marketing Office. Exports of certain other commodities also are reserved for govern- ment agencies, state-trading agencies, or specified com- panies Exports of a few goods to all countries and all exports to Egypt, Israel, and South Africa are prohibited. Exports of certain products and of all goods of foreign origin require licenses. For all other exports, licenses are not required. For most exports, however, a repatriation commitment is required by which the exporter under- takes to bring the proceeds to the Syrian Arab Republic and surrender them to the Commercial Bank of Syria within six months after the date of export. The proceeds of most exports must be surrendered at the official market rate, except that specified percentages of certain commodities exported by both the public and private sectors must be surrendered at the parallel market rate.2 Exports of animals and hides, nuts, perfumes and beauty products, natural silk and silk products, wool and wool products, cotton products, and rugs are eligible for fu ll surrender at the parallel exchange rate. The Commercial Bank of Syria may accept prepayments for exports of Syrian products by residents and nonresidents without referring to the Central Bank of Syria. Certain manufac- tured exports receive subsidies from the Fund for the Development of Exports of Industrial Products. Exports of fruits, vegetables, and olives, and crude oil and its derivatives are subject to an export tax of 12 per- cent ad valorem. Exports of other agricultural products are subject to an ad valorem agricultural tax of 9 percent plus 3 per mill when exported by sea. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions by the public sector must be sold at the official market rate, but those from 2The percentages required to be surrendered at the parallel market rate are as follows (the remainder being at the official rate): textiles (40-60 percent), engineering and chemical products (30-70 percent), and agricultural products (30-50 percent). The surrender ratios in other cases are determined on a commodity-by-commodity basis. 476 transactions by the private sector must be sold at either the parallel market rate or the tourist market rate, according to the nature of the transaction. Nonresidents entering the Syrian Arab Republic are permitted to bring in unlimited foreign exchange in any form. Foreign bank notes may be brought in freely by residents and nonresi- dents. There is no limit on the amount of Syrian bank notes that may be brought into the country by residents and nonresidents. All Syrian nationals employed by Arab, foreign, or international organizations inside the Syrian Arab Republic and paid in full or in part in foreign currencies are required to exchange all such earnings at authorized banks at the official exchange rate. With few exceptions, non-Syrian visitors to the Syrian Arab Republic are required to settle their bills at deluxe and first-class hotels with the counterpart of foreign currencies exchanged by them at authorized local banks at the tourist market exchange rate. Upon entering the country, all such visitors, other than nationals of Arab countries, are each required to convert a minimum of US$100 into local currency at the tourist exchange rate. All Syrian Government employees working abroad and covered by the Security and Pension Act and the Social Security Act are required to repatriate and convert at the tourist market rate a minimum of 25 percent of each year's .pay and allowances received in foreign exchange. Capital All inward and outward capital transfers by the public sector take place at the official market rate, while transactions by the private sector are determined by the Exchange Office of the Central Bank on a case-by-case basis. Imports of private funds in the form of foreign exchange are free for private individuals, whether residents or nonresidents. The export of capital requires the approval of the Exchange Office, as does most borrowing abroad. Order No. 265 of June 10, 1970 provides special facilities for the investment of funds of immigrants and of nationals of Arab states in the economic development of the Syrian Arab Republic. Investment guarantee agreements have been signed with France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Switzerland, and the United States. Immovable property in the Syrian Arab Republic may be acquired by nonresidents or foreign nationals other than resident Arab nationals only after presentation of evidence that the foreign exchange equivalent of the price of the property has been con- verted into Syrian pounds at an authorized local bank. Gold Residents may hold, acquire, and sell gold in the Syrian Arab Republic without restriction. Domestic transactions in gold take place at free market prices that are in line with free market prices abroad. Imports of gold are exempt from import licensing, but exports are subject to licensing. Proceeds from exports by residents must be surrendered. Exports of gold previously im- ported by nonresidents out of their resources abroad are ©International Monetary Fund.

Nonresident and Foreign Currency Accounts February 7. Authorization was granted for individuals and corporations to open accounts in convertible foreign currencies at authorized local banks for the deposit of funds received from abroad. Balances in such accounts could be sold to local banks at the tourist market exchange rate, transferred abroad without any restric- tion, or used in payment for specified imports. Imports and Import Payments February 7. A committee, established with responsi- bility for setting priorities for private sector imports of spare parts, raw materials, and intermediate products, was set up by a ministerial order. In addition, permission was granted for imports of raw materials, production inputs, agricultural and industrial equipment, and spare parts financed with foreign currency obtained abroad. Such imports would not be subject to the waiting list system nor to the payment of prior import deposits, provided that the financing funds had been held in local banks for at least three months, and that the account holder had stayed outside the Syrian Arab Republic for at least one year before opening such an account. November 5. A system was introduced under which, on presentation of a bill or letter from the foreign supplier granting an extended payment term of at least 360 days, anyone holding an import license issued before this date and requesting a letter of credit through the Commercial Bank of Syria (and having lodged the necessary advance deposit in Syrian pounds of 10-70 percent of the total value, depending on the merchandise) could import the merchandise covered by the contract against documents, in accordance with the following time schedule: (a) for licenses granted before September 30, 1983, importation could begin on No- vember 6, 1984; (b) for those granted before March 31, SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC 1984, importation could begin on February 5, 1985; (c) for those granted before September 30, 1984, importation could begin by May 5, 1985; and (d) for those granted before January 6, 1985, importation could begin on August 5, 1985. The shipping documents were required to be sent by the exporter directly to the Commercial Bank of Syria, which would deliver them to the importer on payment of the total amount in Syrian pounds (less the advance deposit) plus 10 percent for the exchange cover. Settle- ment of payment under the arrangement would take place at the time of the bank transfer, i.e., within 360 days. Exports and Export Proceeds March 28.

On January 20, 1979, the fixed relationship of the Tanzania shilling to the SDR was discontinued, and the Tanzania shilling was pegged to a basket of currencies of Tan- zania's main trading partners. The Bank of Tanzania quotes daily Sirying andselling rates for the U.S. dollar. Effective June 15, 1984 the Bank of Tanzania changed the central rate of the shilling against the U.S. dollar from T Sh 12.59 = US$1 to T Sh 17.00 = US$1. The buying and selling rates for other currencies1 are determined on the basis of appropriate cross rates in international markets. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control The Minister of Finance has delegated the administra- tion of exchange control to the Bank of Tanzania. In principle, authority for making payments abroad should be delegated by the Bank of Tanzania to the two authorized banks, the National Bank of Commerce and the People's Bank of Zanzibar. In practice, virtually all outward payments have to be approved by the Bank of Tanzania; control over exchange operations in Zanzibar is exercised by the People's Bank of Zanzibar. On the mainland, import control is administered by the Imports Controller in the Bank of Tanzania and export control by the Exports Controller in the Ministry of Trade. The Bank of Tanzania acts as the registrar of exporters. The responsibility for issuing specific import and export licenses rests with the Controllers, to whom applications must be submitted by the importer or exporter in Tanzania before import orders are placed abroad or exports are shipped. Zanzibar administers an independent system of foreign trade controls through a Board of Trade; all imports and the principal exports are effected by the state-trading agencies (Bizanje and the Zanzibar State Trading Corporation). Prescription of Currency Settlements between residents of Tanzania and non- residents must be made either in convertible currencies or in Tanzania shillings by debit or credit to a Convert- ible Nonresident Account or Loro Account. Nonresident Accounts Accounts maintained by foreign nationals temporarily resident in Tanzania, firms, companies, or other organ- izations registered or incorporated outside Tanzania, Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Indian rupees, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Kenyan shillings, Malawi kwacha, Mozam- bique meticais, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Pakistan rupees, pounds sterling, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, Uganda shillings, Zambian kwacha, and Zimbabwe dollars. 478 foreign diplomatic missions, the United Nations or other international organizations and their officials in Tanzania are designated as Nonresident Accounts. Accounts main- tained by nonresident Tanzanian nationals and foreign nationals who were normally resident in Tanzania and have become nonresidents are also treated as Nonresi- dent Accounts. Nonresident Accounts are broadly divided into two categories: convertible and nonconvertible. Balances on convertible accounts are eligible for transfer from Tan- zania without any further scrutiny of, or approval by, the Bank of Tanzania. Balances on nonconvertible accounts may be transferred from Tanzania after obtaining ap- proval from the Bank of Tanzania. In total, there are six subcategories of Nonresident Accounts: namely, Exter- nal, Shipping/Airline, Special, Ordinary, Expatriate, and Unspecified. Tanzanian nationals and foreign na- tionals normally resident in Tanzania who have pro- ceeded abroad on vacation, employment, or for other purposes mays maintain both Special and Ordinary Accounts in the form of a current, savings, or deposit account, according to the option of the account holders. Imports and Import Payments Imports from South Africa are prohibited. Some imports into the mainland from any source may be prohibited for reasons of health or security. Certain goods listed in the Import Control Notice of April 18, 1980, known as Open General License, are not being licensed; they may be freely imported, irrespective of country of origin, while other goods not listed require specific licenses. For values not exceeding T Sh 10,000 in each case, imports not financed with official foreign exchange do not require licenses. A semiannual foreign exchange plan provides for indicative foreign exchange allocations for goods to be imported subject to specific licenses. Although manufacturers are permitted to im- port many goods directly, the importation of specified goods is restricted to centralized import agencies. Unless specifically exempted by the Bank of Tanzania, indi- vidual consignments of imports amounting to T Sh 20,000 or above are subject to compulsory preshipment inspection for quantity, quality, and price comparison by the Societ6 Generate de Surveillance (SGS) of Geneva, acting as agent for the Government of Tanzania. All merchandise imports by the mainland must be insured with the National Insurance Corporation of Tanzania unless exempted by the Bank of Tanzania, and premiums must be paid in Tanzania shillings. All imports into Zanzibar are made by Bizanje. Most imports, irrespective of their origin, are subject to sales tax at rates ranging up to 50 percent of the c . i . f. value plus import duty. (This tax is also payable on sales of domestic products.) There are arrears in respect of import payments. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to all countries are controlled and require the approval of the Bank of Tanzania. Noncitizens working in Tanzania under contract in salaried employment and with a firm commitment to leave Tanzania eventually may remit abroad, throughout their period of employment, up to one third of their monthly salary to cover family maintenance, savings, etc. Applications to remit more than one third of salary, or in excess of T Sh 6,000 a month, are considered on their merits by the Bank of Tanzania. The basic exchange allocations for tourist travel are no longer being granted. Family remittances by residents to relatives abroad have also been terminated. Resident travelers are allowed to take out T Sh 100 in domestic currency. Nonresident travelers may take out foreign currency notes, traveler's checks, and letters of credit for any amount remaining out of the foreign exchange they brought in. Certain payments for invisibles are in arrears. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to South Africa are prohibited. On the mainland, exports of products handled by state-trading organizations and exports of certain other products are subject to controls and, if there is a local shortage, may be restricted. Exports for sale cannot be effected without an export license. All principal exports of Zanzibar are sold abroad by the Zanzibar State Trading Corporation. Exporters are required to be registered with the Bank of Tanzania and must maintain an account with a local commercial bank. Export proceeds must be collected in convertible currencies within two months from the date of exportation. However, on application to the Bank of Tanzania this period may be extended. Export proceeds must be surrendered to an authorized bank upon their collection. Authorized exporters may retain 5-20 percent of their foreign exchange earnings for the purpose of importing spare parts and other inputs. There is an export rebate scheme under which export- ers may claim rebates varying from 5 percent to 20 per- cent of the f.o.b. price of exports, depending on the commodities involved. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles must be sold to an authorized bank upon collection. Travelers may freely bring in convertible foreign currency notes; a returning traveler may bring in Tanzania shilling notes and coins exported on departure, up to T Sh 100. TANZANIA maintain himself and his dependents and has no ostens- ible means of livelihood in Tanzania, limited foreign exchange facilities may be granted by the Bank of Tanzania purely on compassionate grounds. Gifts to nonresidents require the prior approval of the Bank of Tanzania. There is no restriction on the investment of foreign funds in Tanzania, but to ensure eventual repatriation the investment should be recognized by the Bank of Tan- zania and a certificate of its status as an approved enterprise in terms of the Foreign Investment (Protec- tion) Act, 1963 should be obtained from the Ministry of Finance. Foreign and domestic investment in specified types of production require approval. All imports and exports of securities require approval. Approval is freely granted for the purchase of Tanzanian securities by nonresidents from residents, provided that payment is received in foreign exchange. The income from such securities is remittable, as are the proceeds from resale. Purchases of securities outside Tanzania by residents are not permitted. All loans or overdrafts from residents to nonresidents or to foreign-controlled resident bodies require approval by the Bank of Tanzania. Gold A commemorative gold coin is legal tender but does not circulate within Tanzania. Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Tanzania for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial and professional users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form, other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form, other than jewelry constitut- ing the personal effects of a traveler, are subject to individual licensing by the Bank of Tanzania. Import licenses for gold jewelry are issued by the Bank of Tanzania and are available to goldsmiths only. Licenses are not granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, industrial users, and producers of newly mined gold; imports are limited to an overall import quota. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement June 15. The midpoint exchange rate of the Tanzania shilling vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar, the intervention curren- cy, was changed from T Sh 12.59 per US$1 to T Sh 17.00 per US$1, representing a devaluation of 26 percent. Capital Capital transfers to all countries are subject to control by the Bank of Tanzania and are restricted; all capital transfers require individual exchange control approval. Persons leaving Tanzania permanently for settlement abroad, as a rule, will not be granted foreign exchange facilities. When, however, any person is unable to Imports and Import Payments June 15. It was announced that imports with a value of less than T Sh 10,000 would no longer require prior clearance from the Bank of Tanzania for the purpose of assessing customs duties. In addition, more goods were added to the list of items which could be imported without use of official foreign exchange; the list included 479 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TANZANIA textile goods, electrical appliances, and building mate- rials (whose importation had been limited by the Govern- ment).

The list of items which could be imported without use of official foreign exchange was expanded to include tractors and spares, trucks and pick- up vans, buses, children's wear, and shoes. 480 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution THAILAND (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Thailand is the Thai Baht. In connection with the devaluation of the baht from B 23.0 = US$1 to B 27.0 = US$1 on November 5, 1984, its de facto peg to the U .S. dollar since 1981 was discontinued. The external value of the baht is deter- mined on the basis of the relationship of the baht to a weighted basket of currencies of Thailand's major trading partners as well as other considerations. The Exchange Equalization Fund announces daily the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, for transactions between itself and commercial banks; it also announces daily minimum buying and maximum selling rates that commercial banks must observe when dealing with the public in deutsche mark, Hong Kong dollars, Japanese yen, Malaysian ringgit, pounds sterling, Singapore dollars, and U .S. dollars. On December 31, 1984 the middle official rate was B 27.15 = US$1. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Bank of Thailand on behalf of the Ministry of Finance; the Bank delegates responsibility for most transactions to autho- rized agents (i.e., authorized banks and authorized companies1) and to authorized persons. All incoming exchange must be sold to an authorized agent. All outgoing payments are subject to approval (given auto- matically for bona fide commercial transactions and other current payments); certain inward capital transfers may also be subject to approval, upon prescription by Ministerial Notification.2 Imports of gold require a license issued by the Ministry of Finance. Certain other imports and a few exports are subject to licensing by the Ministry of Commerce. Prescription of Currency There are no special requirements concerning the currency to be used for settlements with foreign coun- tries; most payments are made in U .S. dollars. Nonresident Accounts The Bank of Thailand encourages nonresidents to place foreign currency deposits with commercial banks in Thailand. No restrictions are placed on the opening of a foreign currency account as long as the funds originate abroad. Balances on such accounts may be transferred without formality or restrictions. A commercial bank may pay interest on such deposits at competitive rates. Among baht deposits with commercial banks, there are two types of nonresident baht accounts: Transferable !No authorized company existed by end-1984. 2No such notification has yet been issued. Accounts and Blocked Accounts. In principle, transfers of baht to and from nonresident accounts require ap- proval; there are exemptions, however, for nonresident accounts of foreign diplomatic entities, international organizations based in Thailand, and Thai nationals temporarily abroad. Transferable Accounts may be credited freely with the proceeds from sales to authorized banks of foreign currency transferred from abroad, with amounts transferred from other Transferable Accounts, and with funds eligible for remittance abroad in foreign currency. Balances on Transferable Accounts are con- vertible into foreign currency at any time and may be debited freely for the purchase of foreign currencies for transfer abroad, for transfers to other Transferable Accounts, for payments in respect of exports, and for any other payments to residents. Funds that are not eligible for credit to a Transferable Account must be credited to Blocked Accounts. Transfers of baht from Blocked Accounts for the purchase of foreign currency, except for certain current payments, are subject to approval by the Bank of Thailand; approval is granted when no capital transfer on behalf of a Thai national is involved. Imports and Import Payments Most commodities may be imported freely, but import licenses are required for some commodities, and the import of certain other items is prohibited for protective and other reasons. All imports of goods originating in or shipped from South Africa are subject to licensing. Imports of tea leaf, tea dust, and skimmed milk are subject to a requirement that the importer purchase a proportionate quantity of the same type of goods pro- duced in Thailand. Payments for imports may be approved by authorized banks upon submission of documents; the specific approval of the Bank of Thailand, which is given for all bona fide transactions, is required for advance payments in excess of US$2,000 and for opening revolving letters of credit or letters of credit with an expiry date exceeding nine months. Importers must obtain, in addition to the usual documents, a "certificate of payment" from an authorized agent before imported goods exceeding B 20,000 in value can be cleared through customs; military equipment imported by the Ministry of Defense and certain minor categories of imports are exempt from this requirement. Certain goods are subject to temporary import surcharges. Payments for Invisibles There are no restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. Payments for invis- ibles require authorization, which is usually given by an authorized bank or otherwise by the Bank of Thailand. Cargo insurance premiums due to foreign insurers may 481 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution THAILAND be remitted in foreign exchange; if they are paid in baht to an agent or a branch office of an insurance company registered abroad, they may be remitted as earned income after taxes. The transfer of profits and dividends is permitted freely by the Bank of Thailand. Apart from foreign travel, family maintenance abroad, and educa- tional expenses abroad, authorized agents are permitted to approve applications for exchange without supporting documents, provided that each payment does not exceed the equivalent of US$140. Authorized money changers are prohibited from selling foreign currency to the general public; their business of transacting foreign means of payment is restricted to the buying of foreign currency notes or traveler's checks payable in foreign currencies; all such proceeds must be sold to authorized banks within seven days. For persons traveling abroad for pleasure or personal business trips, authorized agents may approve exchange allowances not exceeding the equivalent of US$875 for trips of less than seven days. For a trip of more than seven days, and on the condition that foreign currencies are taken in the form of traveler's checks, foreign notes, credit card allowances, and traveling letters of credit, daily expenses are allowed automatically up to a max- imum of 10 and 20 days for a trip with or without visa, respectively. With foreign currencies taken in other forms, such as drafts, a maximum of only US$875 is allowed automatically; for an amount of more than US$875, a formal request must be submitted to the Bank of Thailand. For business or official travel, US$175 a day is allowed, and additional foreign exchange not exceeding US$75 a day may be obtained in certain cases for entertainment expenses. For family remittances, authorized banks may sell US$200 a month to each transferor for Europe and the United States and US$150 a month for other countries. Amounts above these limits are approved by the Bank of Thailand upon verification. A person may take out local currency not exceeding B 500 (or B 1,000 for a family traveling on one passport), or foreign currency not exceeding US$500 or the equivalent in the form of notes and coins, or US$700 or the equivalent in the form of drafts without the prior approval of the exchange control authorities. An amount above this limit, but not more than the allowed limit according to the duration of travel, may be sold in other forms of foreign currencies, e.g., traveler's checks. Commercial banks are required to record the sale of foreign currency notes and coins for an amount not exceeding US$250 or the equivalent in the customer's passport as well as to issue a sale voucher, a copy of which must be kept for examination. The resale of foreign currency above such limit to a person in transit is allowed, provided that the record of foreign currency sold to a commercial bank or authorized agent is shown, and that the purchase is not greater than the amount previously sold. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are subject to licensing. Certain categories of exports are subject to licensing, and 482 in a few cases to prior approval, irrespective of destina- tion.3 All other commodities may be exported freely, except to South Africa. Settlement for exports of silver exceeding US$5,000 in value must be made through irrevocable letters of credit. The exporter is required to obtain a "certificate of exportation" from an authorized agent in order to clear the shipment through customs where shipments of tin or rubber exceed B 2,000 in value and, with minor exceptions, where exports of other goods exceed B 20,000 in value. Export proceeds must be collected and must be sold to an authorized agent within 7 days of receipt; they must be surrendered within 15 days from the date of export if payment is made by letter of credit, 21 days if a sight bill is drawn for collection, 15 days after the due date of a usance bill, or 15 days for other methods of payment, but in any case not later than 180 days after the date of export.

The export of most types of rice and rice products and of sugar is subject to export levies referred to as export premiums. Proceeds from Invisibles All receipts from invisibles must be sold to an authorized agent. Authorized persons are allowed to purchase foreign currency notes and coin or traveler's checks payable in foreign currencies, but the latter must be resold to authorized banks. No person may bring into Thailand local currency exceeding B 2,000 without a permit (or B 4,000 for a family traveling on one passport). Travelers may bring in any amount in foreign notes and coin. Capital All outward transfers of capital, including premiums on life insurance policies, by residents or nonresidents are subject to approval. Personal capital exports by residents are restricted. The Bank of Thailand approves the remittance of donations and gifts of a reasonable amount. Foreign exchange from inward capital move- ments must be sold to an authorized agent and the purpose of the transfer must be declared. Foreign investments in Thailand may be accorded preferential treatment under the Investment Promotion Act B.E. 2520 (issued on April 29, 1977); this treatment includes a guarantee of the transfer abroad of current net earnings and of capital repatriation. The repatriation of other capital is considered on the merits of each case; approval is normally granted if it can be shown that the funds originated abroad. Certain economic activities are reserved for Thai nationals. The contracting of suppliers' credits abroad requires approval by the Bank of Thailand. All other private loans 3These include gold, platinum, precious stones, live cattle and other specified animals, coffee, sorghum, corn, all types of sugar, brass and copper in certain forms, iron scrap and most forms of iron other than pig iron and iron ore, and Deva and Buddha images.

Gold Residents may hold and negotiate domestically gold jewelry, gold coin, and unworked gold. Purchases or sales of gold on commodity futures exchanges are prohibited. Imports and exports of gold other than jewelry are subject to the following arrangements, unless they are effected by or on behalf of the monetary authorities: commercial imports of gold in any form are restricted and require a license issued by the Ministry of Finance; for gold bullion, the Ministry periodically fixes an authorized quantity of imports. A bidding system operates under which the importer offering the highest premium by tender is awarded a license as sole importer of the authorized quantity for a certain period. In addition to this premium, which accrues to the Govern- ment, the importer is required to pay to the Ministry of Finance a fee at the rate of 2 percent of the c . i . f. value of the gold. Foreign tourists may take out gold ornaments up to any value. Exports of gold bullion are prohibited; traders' exports of gold ornaments exceeding B 5,000 in value require a certificate of exportation for presentation to the customs, but they are free of export duty or taxes.

Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market and the fixed rate between the French franc and the CFA franc. The BCEAO levies a commission of 0.10 per mill on transfers from countries outside the West African Mone- tary Union and one of 2.50 per mill on transfers to such countries.2 Banks levy a commission on transfers to all countries outside the West African Monetary Union, part of which must be surrendered to the Treasury. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. With the exception of measures relating to gold and the repatriation of export proceeds, Togo's exchange controls do not apply to (1) France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, the Congo, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, and Senegal). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries are considered foreign countries. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, which also supervises borrowing abroad, the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Togo, inward direct investment and all outward investment, and the soliciting of funds in Togo for placement in foreign countries. Some of the approval authority in respect of exchange control has been delegated to authorized intermediaries and the BCEAO. The BCEAO is authorized to collect, either directly or through the banks, financial institutions, the Postal Administration, and offices of government minis- tries, any information necessary to compile balance of payments statistics. Forwarding and receipt of bank notes through the mail by authorized intermediaries is subject to control by the BCEAO. All exchange transac- tions relating to foreign countries must be effected through authorized banks, the Postal Administration, or the BCEAO. Import and export licenses are issued by the Foreign Trade Division in the Ministry of Commerce and 'The CFA franc is issued by the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de 1'Quest (BCEAO) and is the common currency in Ben in, Bu rk ina Faso, Ivory Coast, Ma l i, Niger, Senegal, and Togo. 2 Transfers between member countries of the Union are subject to the flat commission of CFAF 100 levied on settlements between agencies of the BCEAO. 486 Transport, except those for gold, which are granted by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Prescription of Currency Since Togo is an Operations Account country, set- tlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other Operations Account country. Current payments in rela- tion to The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone are normally effected through the West African Clearing House. Settlements with all other countries are usually effected through correspondent banks in France, in any of the currencies of those countries, or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. The crediting to nonresident accounts of CFA bank notes, French bank notes, or bank notes issued by any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account is not permitted, except for credits to Foreign Accounts held by foreign correspondents of authorized banks, which may be credited with BCEAO bank notes mailed direct to the BCEAO agency in Lome by those correspondents. Foreign Accounts in Francs may also be debited, without authorization, w i th BCEAO bank notes mailed by authorized intermediaries to their foreign correspondents through the BCEAO agency in Lome. Imports and Import Payments All imports of South African origin are prohibited. Imports from countries in the French Franc Area may be made freely, but require the prior authorization of the Foreign Trade Division in the Ministry of Commerce and Transport when valued at CFAF 10,000 or more and are for commercial purposes. Imports from all other coun- tries require individual import licenses when valued at CFAF 10,000 or more. In principle, the licenses are granted in accordance with an import program estab- lished each year; as yet, however, the program has not been established, and almost all requests for import licenses, irrespective of the origin of the goods, are granted. There is no formal free list. The issuance of import licenses for printed piece goods of Japanese origin is conditional, in principle, on the purchase of a specified quantity of the local product; in practice, this requirement is no longer enforced. The Societe Nationale de Commerce (SONACOM) has an import monopoly for sugar cubes, rice, f lour, canned m i lk, soap for household use, salt, tobacco and tobacco products, corrugated iron, concrete reinforcement rods, and alco- holic beverages originating in foreign countries or ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution having an alcohol content exceeding 35 degrees (Baume) and imported from the Franc area. All import transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value exceeds CFAF 500,000, with the exception of imports not involving sale of foreign exchange or financed through the Postal Administration, and certain imports of a special nature. Import licenses entitle importers to purchase the necessary exchange, spot, but not earlier than eight days before shipment if a documen- tary credit is opened, or on the due date of payment if the commodities already have been imported. Purchases of foreign exchange for down payment are subject to prior authorization by the Minister, which is valid only from the date such payment is due and only for up to 30 per- cent of each transaction involving capital goods and 10 percent for other transactions. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to approval. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted by a general authorization when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresi- dents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also generally permitted. For tourist travel, residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may obtain an exchange allocation of an amount equivalent to CFAF 175,000 a person a trip (CFAF 87,500 for children under ten) for any number of trips a year; any foreign exchange in excess of CFAF 5,000 remaining after return to Togo must be surrendered within eight days of re-entry. For business travel, there is a special allocation of the equivalent of CFAF 20,000 a day, subject to a maximum of CFAF 400,000 a trip. The transfer of the entire net salary of a foreign national working in Togo is permitted upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher, residence permit, or work permit, provided that the transfer takes place within three months of the pay period. Residents may at any time and without indicating the purpose of the transfer make payments abroad, through an authorized bank, up to CFAF 50,000 a transfer. Resident and nonresident travelers to foreign countries may take out up to a maximum of CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO bank notes, French bank notes, and bank notes of other Operations Account countries. Resident travelers to other countries of the French Franc Area may take out any amount in BCEAO bank notes, but if proceeding to a country that is not a member of the West African Monetary Union, they must declare to the customs the amount taken out if it exceeds CFAF 250,000. TOGO Nonresident travelers may take out foreign bank notes and coin up to the amount declared by them on entry3 or, if no declaration has been made, up to the equ iva lent of CFAF 175,000. Nonresident travelers may also freely take out any amount of letters of credit and traveler's checks drawn in their names abroad. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to all countries require licenses. All exports to South Africa are prohibited. The Office Togolais des Phosphates (OTP) has a monopoly over the export of phosphates and the Office des Produits Agricoles du Togo (OPAT) has a monopoly over the export of cacao, coffee, cotton, groundnuts, and certain other agricultural commodities. The due date for payment for exports to foreign countries, including the French Franc Area, may not be later than 180 days after the arrival of the goods at their destination, and the proceeds must be surrendered within a month after the due date; authorized diamond purchasing offices, however, may retain foreign cur- rency proceeds in foreign currency accounts with autho- rized banks in Togo. All export transactions relating to foreign countries, including the French Franc Area, must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value exceeds CFAF 500,000. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisible transactions with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services, and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets, must be collected and surrendered w i th in one month of the due date or the date of receipt. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank notes and coin issued by the BCEAO, the Bank of France, or any institute of issue maintaining an Opera- tions Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) of countries outside the French Franc Area. Residents bringing in foreign bank notes and foreign currency traveler's checks in excess of CFAF 5,000 must sell them to an authorized bank within eight days. Capital Capital movements between Togo and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require exchange control approval by the Minister of Economy and Finance and are restricted, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. 3 This amount is adjusted for (1) the amount of foreign currency sold for CFA francs, and (2) any foreign currency acquired in Togo by (a) debit to a Foreign Account in Francs or a Foreign Account in Foreign Currency, (b) the conversion of foreign currency trave ler's checks, etc., made out in the name of the traveler, and (c) any repurchases of foreign currency (permitted up to CFAF 175,000) w i th CFA francs resulting from the sale of foreign currency. 487 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TOGO Special controls (additional to any exchange control requirements that may be applicable) are maintained over borrowing abroad, over inward direct investment and all outward investment, over the issuing, advertis- ing, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Togo, and over the soliciting of funds in Togo for placing abroad. Such operations require prior authorization by the Minis- ter of Economy and Finance. Exempt from authoriza- tion, however, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Togolese Government and (2) shares that are identical with, or may be substituted for, securities whose issuing, adver- tising, or offering for sale in Togo has already been authorized. With the exception of controls relating to foreign securities and the soliciting of funds in Togo, these measures do not apply to relations with France (as defined above), Monaco, member countries of the West African Monetary Union, and the Operations Account countries. There also are special controls applicable to all countries other than Togo with respect to imports and exports of gold. All investments abroad by residents of Togo require prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance;4 beginning June 24, 1981 at least 75 percent of such investments must be financed by foreign borrow- ing. Foreign direct investments in Togo5 must be declared to the Minister of Economy and Finance before they are made. The Minister has a period of two months from receipt of the declaration during which he may request postponement of the projects. The total or partial liquidation of any inward direct investment or any outward investment also requires prior declaration to the Minister of Economy and Finance. Both the making and the liquidation of investments, whether these are Togo- lese investments abroad or foreign investments in Togo, must be reported to the Minister of Economy and Finance and to the BCEAO within 20 days following each operation. Direct investments constitute invest- ments implying control of a company or enterprise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 percent of the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. Borrowing by residents from nonresidents requires prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans constituting a direct investment, which are subject to prior declaration, as indicated 4 Including investments made through foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in Togo and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Togo. 5 Including those made by companies in Togo that are directly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in Togo of foreign companies. 488 above; (2) loans contracted by authorized banks; (3) loans taken up either by industrial firms to finance operations abroad or by approved international mer- chanting houses to finance imports or exports; and (4) in certain circumstances, any other loans, provided that the outstanding amount for any one borrower does not exceed CFAF 100 million. The repayment of any foreign borrowing requires the prior authorization of the Minis- ter of Economy and Finance; exempt from this require- ment are loans constituting a direct investment, loans taken up by authorized banks, and any loans exempted by the Minister. Lending abroad is subject only to special authorization by the Directorate of Economy. Under the provisions of the general tax legislation, certain fiscal benefits are accorded to specified new investment (foreign and domestic) in both new and existing enterprises. In addition, certain enterprises, in accordance with their importance to the economic development of Togo, may be granted special privileges for a specified number of years relating to the mainte- nance of existing taxes and exemption from import duties. Such privileges are negotiated by the Govern- ment and the investor. An Investment Law, applicable to both foreign and domestic capital, sets out the types of enterprises that may be designated as "priority enterprises," provided that the head office is in Togo. Such firms may sign a special founding agreement by which they receive certain tax benefits. Firms that undertake to invest at least CFAF 25 million may receive a guarantee in respect of their taxation over a number of years. The law guarantees the right of free transfer abroad of capital invested in Togo and of all investment income therefrom. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Togo. Imports and exports of gold from or to any other country require prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the Treasury or the BCEAO; (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles); and (3) imports and exports by travelers of gold objects up to a combined weight of 500 grams. Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Changes During 1984 Capital December 31. A new Investment Law was promul- gated; implementation of the law was expected to commence shortly. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Trinidad and Tobago is the Trinidad and Tobago Dollar, which is pegged to the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, at TT$2.4 = US$1. The official buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar are TT$2.3970 and TT$2.4210, respectively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates for certain other currenciesl are also officially quoted, with daily quotations based on the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar in markets abroad. Administration of Control The authority to administer exchange control is vested in the Central Bank, acting as agent of the Government. The Central Bank exercises direct exchange control approval authority on imports of invisible items by requiring persons wishing to import such items to apply to the Central Bank, which will authorize in advance the amount of foreign exchange that will be made available for the importation of the specified item. Approval authority with respect to the approval of payment for visible imports has been delegated to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce; with respect to payments up to specified amounts for certain current invisibles, such authority has been delegated to authorized banks. The exchange control system provides for compulsory surrender of foreign currency2'3 and for control over both current and capital transactions. All overseas payments and transfers require the approval of the exchange control authorities; payments to South Africa are prohibited. Short-term credit transactions, such as the granting of credit, loan, or overdraft facilities by resident banks to nonresidents and local nonresident- controlled companies, are also subject to control. Notes issued by the East Caribbean Currency Author- ity and the Central Bank of Barbados are not legal tender in Trinidad and Tobago, but under an arrangement with the monetary authorities concerned, the notes are pur- chased by the monetary authorities and are repatriated by them in return for reciprocity of treatment with respect to collections of Trinidad and Tobago dollars. From April 7, 1981 the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago no longer repatriates Trinidad and Tobago currency 1 Barbados dollars, Canadian dollars, deutsche mark, Eastern Carib- bean dollars, French francs, Guyana dollars, Jamaica dollars, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, and Swiss francs. 2Under Trinidad and Tobago's exchange control regulations, all currencies other than the Trinidad and Tobago dollar are considered foreign currencies. 3If the business of a trader, firm, or company involves frequent receipts and payments in foreign currencies, permission may be granted for the retention of a portion of receipts in a Foreign Currency Account, subject to the requirement that periodic statements of credits and debits to the account be submitted to the authorities. notes from the monetary authorities of the Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM) countries.4 Import and export licenses, when required, are issued by the Trade and Commerce Division of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Prescription of Currency Settlements may be made in U .S. dollars or in any other specified currency5 except South African currency. Authorized payments, including payments for imports, to all countries may be made in U .S. dollars or in any other specified currency. Payments from all countries with which trade is allowed must be received in U .S. dollars or in any other specified currency. Nonresident Accounts There are two types of nonresident accounts: External Accounts and Blocked Accounts. External Accounts may be opened by commercial banks for nonresidents of Trinidad and Tobago. These accounts may be credited with payments by residents of Trinidad and Tobago that have been approved by the exchange control authorities, with transfers from other External Accounts, and with proceeds from the sale of gold and foreign currencies to an authorized dealer. They may be debited for payments to residents of Trinidad and Tobago, for transfers to other External Accounts, and for purchases of foreign currencies. The funds in these accounts are treated as equivalent to External Accounts in U .S. dollars or any other foreign currency and may be transferred freely between residents of countries outside Trinidad and Tobago, with the exception that transfers from External Accounts held by residents of the CARICOM countries to any country outside Trinidad and Tobago other than that of the holder's residence are conditional upon the Central Bank's being satisfied that the exchange control authorities of the holder's country of residence do not object. Blocked Accounts are normally credited with the balance of capital assets of persons who have emigrated from Trinidad and Tobago. The use of balances on Blocked Accounts is subject to authorization. Blocked funds may be reinvested in local securities which are not redeemable either optionally or contractually w i th in four years from the date of acquisition. Income arising from Blocked Accounts (such as interest and rents) is freely 4The CARICOM countries are Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Chris- topher and Nev is, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. 5Aus tr ian schillings, Belgian francs, Bunnese kyats, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, I ta l ian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and pounds sterling. 489 ©International Monetary Fund.

Gener- ally, funds held in Blocked Accounts are eligible for remittance to nonresidents after a period of four years. other industrial inputs, and essential food and drugs. Importers must obtain exchange approval from the Central Bank before an import license can be activated. Imports and Import Payments While most commodities may be imported under open general license arrangements, some imports are subject to the provisions of a Negative List. The list cites over 400 items that are subject to regulation by specific license and also identifies countries that are accorded special treatment. Trade with South Africa is prohibited, and all imports from Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, the Democratic Peo- ple's Republic of Korea, Poland, Romania, the U .S .S .R ., and Yugoslavia are subject to specific licens- ing, irrespective of the Negative List status of the import concerned. At present, trade with these countries may be settled in U.S. dollars. In principle, trade with CARICOM countries is to be effected through the CARICOM multilateral clearing facility (CMCF). The domestic importer or exporter makes payments or receipts in domestic currency, with corresponding credits and debits recorded for the two countries by the CMCF agent. Foreign exchange set- tlement is deferred until fixed semiannual settlement periods and is effected in U .S. dollars. Effective March 31, 1983, Trinidad and Tobago suspended the CMCF arrangement on the stated grounds of failure on the part of certain member states to settle outstanding balances. Imports from all other countries may be paid for in any currency in which the goods are satisfactorily invoiced. The main items that are subject to the Negative List include cement, clothing, corrugated iron sheeting, cosmetics, saccharin, coffee and cocoa beans, and completely assembled motor vehicles. Firearms, ammu- nition, and narcotics are either prohibited or rigidly controlled for security and health reasons. Certain food products are covered by the Agricultural Marketing Protocol of the CARICOM Treaty. Imports of rice, oils, and fats are subject to state trading; rice is normally imported from Guyana at agreed prices.6 All imports of food and drugs must satisfy prescribed standards. Im- ports of meat, live animals, and plants are subject to specific regulation, as are imports of mining materials. All other commodities from all sources may be imported under open general license. Where specific import licenses are required they must be obtained from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce before orders are placed. Payments for all imports require exchange control approval. Annual foreign exchange sales for imports are guided by a foreign exchange budget for imports. The allocation criteria give priority to capital goods, raw materials, 6 Packaged rice may be imported through normal commercial channels, but such imports are not usua l ly allowed from countries other than Guyana unless the contracted supplies are not forthcoming. 490 Payments for Invisibles Payments for current invisibles require the specific approval of the authorities. Applications for foreign exchange must be supported by appropriate documentary evidence. No restrictions are imposed on payments for current international transactions, except with respect to South Africa. Under authority delegated by the Central Bank, the authorized banks may approve applications for foreign exchange within prescribed limits for certain transactions in invisibles. When additional amounts are needed, the approval of the authorities is required and this is granted provided that unauthorized capital trans- fers are not involved. For outward remittances of gifts and donations, the commercial banks must obtain ap- proval from the Central Bank. The basic allowance for tourist travel is TT$2,500 a person a year, for business travel TT$350 a day for a maximum of 30 days for one trip, and for health care TT$12,000 a year. Allowances for education abroad are TT$8,000 for schools, TT$12,000 for universities, TT$1,200 for correspon- dence courses, and TT$700 once every two years for warm clothing. Residents and nonresidents may take out of Trinidad and Tobago notes up to the equivalent of TT$200. Travelers who are regarded as residents of Trinidad and Tobago may export part of their basic travel allowance up to a maximum of TT$1,200 in foreign currency notes. Nonresidents visiting Trinidad and Tobago may, on departure, take out foreign currency notes up to the amount brought in by them. Nonresidents leaving Trinidad and Tobago are allowed to reconvert Trinidad and Tobago dollar notes into foreign currency up to the equivalent of TT$ 1,200 upon showing evidence of having purchased such funds from authorized dealers. For sums in excess of TT$ 1,200, nonresidents must obtain exchange approval from the Central Bank. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. Exports of certain goods usually require an individual license. These include some foodstuffs, arms and explosives, animals, gold, and petroleum and petroleum products produced in Trinidad and Tobago, as well as specified products not produced locally. Exports of all other commodities are permitted by an open general license. In addition, general licenses may be issued at the discretion of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce; such licenses have been issued to permit petroleum companies and sugar companies to export without specific licenses. The proceeds from sugar exports are subject to a tax, which varies on the basis of the price of the export sale. Purchases of petroleum and petroleum products from Trinidad and Tobago by other CARICOM countries are aided by the provisions of the CARICOM Oil Facility established by the Government; the facility provides ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution long-term, low-interest loans to finance the increase over the level on January 1, 1979 in the cost of oil imports from Trinidad and Tobago by other CARICOM countries. Export proceeds received in foreign currencies must be surrendered, but exporters of certain goods, notably petroleum, may be authorized to retain abroad a portion of their proceeds. In practice, the petroleum companies operating in Trinidad and Tobago repatriate all foreign exchange after providing for the equivalent of their local currency needs. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from current invisibles received in foreign currencies must be surrendered. Insurance, shipping, and similar companies operating in Trinidad and Tobago are usually authorized to maintain operating accounts for receipts and expenditures in foreign currency. These companies give periodic accounts of their exchange transactions to the authorities. Residents and nonresidents may bring in Trinidad and Tobago currency notes up to the value of TT$200. Foreign currency notes may be imported freely by residents and nonresidents. Capital Capital transfers from Trinidad and Tobago require approval and generally are restricted. However, repay- ment of commercial credits is permitted freely, and gifts to nonresidents and emigration allowances are approved up to specified limits; furthermore, as a matter of policy, capital transfers to other CARICOM countries are per- mitted liberally. Legacies may be expatriated in fu l l. However, the Central Bank reserves the right to phase remittances up to a maximum of four years. Certain international institutions may be permitted to borrow in Trinidad and Tobago on a case-by-case basis. For transactions in securities, 14 authorized de- positories have been appointed. Restrictions are placed on the import and export of all securities other than securities expressed in Trinidad and Tobago dollars. Contractual amortization of sterling securities is per- mitted, and also of mortgages and other loans if the original borrowing occurred prior to September 1939 or was subsequently approved by the exchange control authorities. Proceeds from the sale of securities or other invest- ments owned by nonresidents of Trinidad and Tobago may not ordinarily be transferred and are eligible for credit only to a Blocked Account (see section on Nonresident Accounts, above); however, approval is often given to residents to purchase such assets. All foreign investment, whether in cash or in kind, is normally eligible for repatriation provided it has been registered with the Central Bank. Hence, when funds are received for investment, local banks should authenticate the receipt of such funds from External Accounts. In the event of an appreciation in the value of the asset TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO concerned, the remittance of any funds in excess of the original investment w i ll normally be phased over a max imum of five years, depending on the balance of payments situation. Residents may transfer prescribed securities to persons resident outside Trinidad and Tobago, w i th the prior approval of the exchange control authorities, provided that the fu ll proceeds of sale are received in foreign currency. Foreign exchange is not normally provided for portfolio investment by residents in foreign securities, but when securities are sold or redeemed in a market outside Trinidad and Tobago, the proceeds may either be brought in and sold to an authorized dealer at the official market rate of exchange or, with the prior approval of the exchange control authorities, be invested outside Trinidad and Tobago in similar securities. Nonresidents may sell local securities, provided that the proceeds are credited to a Blocked Account or are reinvested in other local securities which are either irredeemable or are not redeemable within four years from the date of purchase. The laws of Trinidad and Tobago do not discriminate between nationals and foreigners in the formation and operation of companies in that country. Foreigners are required, however, to obtain a license under the Aliens (Landholding) Ordinance in order to hold interest in real estate or to hold shares in local companies. Prospective foreign investors must obtain approval for their project from the authorities in Trinidad and Tobago in order to be able to repatriate capital and capital gains. The Government has enacted basic incentive legisla- tion designed to attract domestic and foreign investment in manufacturing and in import-substitution industries. Since 1973 these policies have been effected w i th in the framework of a CARICOM agreement on harmonization of fiscal incentives. Certain concessions are granted to industries declared to be pioneer industries, that is, industries that have not previously existed in Trinidad and Tobago or which are not being conducted on a commercial scale, or any industry for which there are favorable prospects for future development. Every pioneer manufacturer is entitled to temporary relief from import duties and taxes and to other privileges. There are limitations on the extent to which banks may grant finance to nonresident individuals and firms (other than residents of other CARICOM countries) and to nonresident-controlled local companies. Such companies are normally required to raise any local capital needed to supplement their assets by issuing either shares or bonds to residents of Trinidad and Tobago. Each commercial bank must maintain the monthly average of its net foreign exchange position w i th in a specified quantitative ceiling. A commercial bank, as an authorized dealer, is allowed to hold an "open" asset or liability position in foreign exchange. However, the monthly average of its net foreign exchange position must be maintained w i th in specified quantitative ceilings. 491 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO Gold Gold is defined by the Exchange Control Act of 1970 as gold coin and bullion. The regulations provide that, except with specific exemptions and permissions granted by the Minister of Finance, (1) one party to every transaction in gold between residents must be an autho- rized bank, (2) gold held by residents must be surren- dered to an authorized bank, and (3) gold may not be taken or sent out of Trinidad and Tobago. Residents are permitted in appropriate cases, however, to purchase, hold, or sell gold coins in Trinidad and Tobago for numismatic purposes. Control on the import and export of gold is adminis- tered by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Imports of gold jewelry are on open general license, but imports of gold other than jewelry are subject to specific import licenses issued by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce; such licenses are not normally issued except to the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users. Exports of gold, whether jewelry or otherwise» are subject to specific export licenses issued by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce; such licenses for gold other than jewelry are not normally granted except to the monetary authorities. Imports of unrefined gold from non-CARlGOM sources are subject to import duty at 5 per- cent (preferential duty) or 15 percent (general du ty), and those of partly worked gold at 15 percent (preferential duty) or 25 percent (general du ty ). Such imports are free of purchase tax. Changes During 1984 Imports and Import Payments January 1. Sales of foreign exchange for imports of aerated beverages and beer were suspended indefinitely. March 12. Specific import licensing requirements were introduced for certain electric and electronic con- sumer goods, including refrigerators, deep freezers, television sets, radios, turntables, portable cassette re- corders, and automobile tires. May 7. Imports of steel products were brought under the Negative List. 492 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TUNISIA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Tunisia is the Tunisian Dinar. The exchange value of the dinar is determined in accordance with a basketjoLcurrenQies. The buying and selling rates for foreign currencies1 are fixed daily by the Central Bank of Tunisia. On December 31, 1984 the spot buying and selling rates of the dinar were D 0.08962 and D 0.09052, respectively, per F 1, and D 0.8623 and D 0.8709, respectively, per US$1. Since February 1, 1979, forward quotations are provided daily for the deutsche mark, the French franc, and the U.S. dollar.2 The buying and selling rates of authorized banks are identical with those of the Central Bank. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Central Bank; some authority over payments for imports and invisibles is delegated to the authorized banks. Foreign trade control is administered by the Commerce Directorate of the Ministry of National Economy, which determines, in consultation with the Central Bank, the Industry Direc- torate, and other concerned Ministries the imports and exports that are to be prohibited or liberalized as well as the imports that are to be subject to quotas in accordance with the Government's overall program and the trade agreements with foreign countries. The Directorate, in collaboration with the Central Bank, issues import and export licenses. Prescription of Currency Settlements between Tunisia and foreign countries are made in convertible currencies quoted by the Central Bank (see footnote 1) or in convertible Tunisian dinars through Foreign Accounts. Settlements between Tunisia and Morocco, and certain settlements between Tunisia and Algeria, may be effected through accounts in the national currencies concerned at the central banks. Payments to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dinars may be opened freely by all nonresidents regardless of national- ity. These accounts may be credited freely with dinar proceeds from sales to the Central Bank of convertible currencies including bank notes declared to the Customs, 1 Currencies quoted spot and at bank note rates are Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Kuwaiti dinars, Moroccan dirhams, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Saudi Arabian riyals, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, U .A .E. dirhams, and U .S. dollars. Luxembourg francs, Qatar riyals, and CFA francs are quoted at bank note rates only; and Libyan dinars and Algerian dinars are quoted spot only. 2 The forward rates are calculated for periods of one month to six months for the selling rates and of one, two, and three months for the buying rates. with interest on balances in these accounts, and with transfers from other Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dinars; all other credits require prior authorization, either direct or by delegation. They may be debited freely for payments of any kind in Tunisia (irrespective of the country of residence of the payer), for transfers to other Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dinars, and for the purchase of any foreign currency from the Central Bank. Such currency may be transferrred abroad or remitted in Tunisia to the account holder or to any other nonresident beneficiary. Foreign Accounts in Convertible Foreign Currencies may be established by nonresidents without authoriza- tion. They may be credited with convertible foreign currencies remitted to the account holder by a nonresi- dent, with foreign currency purchased from the Central Bank by debit of a Foreign Account in Convertible Dinars, with authorized payments by residents in favor of the account holder, with interest payable by the authorized intermediaries on foreign exchange deposits in the accounts whenever they can use the funds thus deposited at remunerative rates, with the proceeds from the cashing of checks, traveler's checks, or drafts expressed in convertible currencies and made out by a nonresident to the order of the account holder, and with foreign bank notes declared to the Customs. The ac- counts may be debited at any time for the sale of foreign currency to the Central Bank, for transfers to any Foreign Account, for transfer abroad, or for delivery of foreign currency to the account holder or any other nonresident beneficiary. Capital Accounts may be opened in the name of a resident of any foreign country. The opening of a Capital Account by a nonresident of Tunisian nationality or his spouse must be authorized by the Central Bank. Foreign banks may hold global Capital Accounts for their nonresident customers. Subject to certain conditions, Capital Accounts may be credited, without prior ap- proval of the Central Bank, with the proceeds of the sale on the stock exchange, or of the contractual or advance redemption, of Tunisian securities, the sales proceeds of real estate or rights to real estate situated in Tunisia, and with funds from another Capital Account. Irrespective of the account holder's country of residence, Capital Accounts may be freely debited for living expenses in Tunisia of the account holder and his fam i ly, up to D 100 a person a week, provided that total withdrawals from one or more Capital Accounts in a calendar year do not exceed D 2,000 a family. In addition, a Capital Account holder traveling in Tunisia between November 1 and March 31 may withdraw from such an account an amount equal to the foreign exchange imported for the trip and surrendered to the Central Bank of Tunisia, an authorized intermediary, or a subagency, provided that total withdrawals for the living expenses of the account 493 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TUNISIA holder or his fam i ly do not exceed D 2,000 a year. Such accounts may also be debited, subject to certain condi- tions, for expenses connected w i th the management of Tun is ian securities, the maintenance, repair, and insur- ance of real estate and all taxes, and for transfer to the credit of another Capital Account. Subject to certain conditions, they may also be debited to assist the account holder's parents and offspring residing in Tunisia at a max imum rate of D 50 a person a month. These accounts may not be overdrawn. Balances held by physical persons of foreign nationality and not exceeding D 1,000 on December 31, 1973 or D 2,000 on May 31, 1975 are transferable abroad. Physical and juridical persons of French nationality holding Capital Accounts may trans- fer up to D 2,000 of balances belonging to them in each such account as of October 25, 1980. Furthermore, balances outstanding on October 31, 1980 can be used up to December 31, 1985 for the purchase of five-year government bonds, when the amount utilized is not greater than D 10,000, and seven-year government bonds with funds utilized over and above that amount. Interest payments and repayments on maturing bonds are trans- ferable through an authorized intermediary. Internal Nonresident Accounts are used by natural persons of foreign nationality staying temporarily in Tunisia and receiving income in dinars there; these accounts may be opened freely, but balances may be used only in Tunisia. Internal Nonresident Export Accounts may be credited with the salaries of nonresident foreign nationals em- ployed in enterprises authorized under Law No. 72—38 of April 27, 1972. Special Dinar Accounts. Nonresident foreign enter- prises holding contracts in Tunisia are authorized freely to open, for each contract, a single special account in dinars for deposit of the portion of the contract price payable in dinars to cover their local expenses. Such accounts may also be credited with funds from a Foreign Account in Convertible Dinars, the dinar equivalent of foreign currency drawn on a Foreign Account in Con- vertible Foreign Currency, the dinar equivalent of any transfer in convertible foreign currency from abroad, and interest accruing on funds deposited in the account. The account may be freely debited for the enterprise's contract-related expenses in Tunisia. Any transfer operations from such accounts must be authorized by the Central Bank of Tunisia. Suspense Accounts are used for crediting all proceeds accruing in Tunisia to nonresidents where such proceeds are awaiting utilization in Tunisia for specified purposes or central bank approval for transfer abroad or transfer to other nonresident accounts. Subject to certain condi- tions, Suspense Accounts may be debited, without the prior authorization of the Central Bank, in respect of purchases of Tunisian securities, subscriptions to issues of short-term debentures or bonds, portfolio manage- ment expenses in respect of certain securities, payments to the Tunisian Government or public institutions, and settlement of living expenses incurred in Tunisia by the 494 account holder or his fam i ly up to D 100 a person a week, provided that the total w i thdrawa ls in any calendar year from one or more accounts do not exceed D 2,000 a fam i ly. In addition, a Capital Account holder traveling in Tun is ia between November 1 and March 31 may w i th- draw from such an account an amount equal to the foreign exchange imported for the trip and surrendered to the Central Bank of Tun is ia, an authorized intermediary, or a subagency, provided that total w i thdrawa ls for the l iv ing expenses of the account holder or his fam i ly do not exceed D 2,000 a year. Physical persons of foreign nationality may transfer abroad assets that they hold if these did not exceed D 1,000 on December 31, 1973 or D 2,000 on May 31, 1975. Physical or juridical persons of French nationality holding Suspense Accounts may transfer up to D 2,000 of balances belonging to them in each such account as of October 25, 1980. All other debits to these accounts require the authorization of the Central Bank. Foreign Currency Savings Accounts may be main- tained with the Postal Administration in the names of Tunisian natural or juridical persons who are resident abroad. These accounts may be credited w i th the countervalue in dinars of convertible foreign currency transferred by the account holder by check or postal transfer. They may be debited freely. In addition, the balances of foreign Suspense Accounts closed out as of 10/31/80 which meet the conditions for being converted into Capital Accounts may be used un t il the end of 1985 to purchase 5-year government bonds if the funds used do not exceed D 10,000 and for the purchase of 7-year government bonds if the funds used should exceed this amount. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Israel and South Africa are pro- hibited. A system of import controls is applied under which there are different procedures for different oper- ators (manufacturers, traders, and state monopolies) and special procedures for specified categories of transac- tions (e.g., export firms, and imports without payment from official foreign exchange). All imports, other than specified items amounting to about one fourth of the total, require prior authorization. Imports not subject to prior authorization require import certificates, which are cleared through commercial banks upon presentation of a commercial contract and which are copied and sent to the Central Bank for monitoring purposes. The freely importable products are listed in Annex I of the Notice to Importers and Exporters, pub- lished in the Official Gazette No. 75 of November 27, 1981, with subsequent amendments. The list contains many spare parts importable by industries for their own use. In addition, the import certificate procedure may be used for the importation of capital goods authorized by either the Investment Promotion Agency or the Agricultural Investment Promotion Agency, even if the goods in question do not appear on the list of freely importable products. Imports of goods not classified as ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution freely importable require either an annual import authori- zation or a specific import license. The approval of applications for licenses is handled by the Commerce Directorate of the Ministry of National Economy, in consultation with the Central Bank and, if necessary, the appropriate technical ministry (Agriculture, Industry, etc.). An "annual import authorization" is available to industrialists and agencies reponsible for providing the country w i th certain staples or industrial products; approvals are not transferable between enterprises. Each industrialist must submit a detailed document, giving information on not only expected import requirements for the following year and the actual consumption of imported or domestically produced inputs in the previous year, but also information on sales, production, employ- ment, import prices, and the f i rm 's financial position. Annual import authorizations are given for a global l im i t, expressed in dinars; they are valid for one year with an automatic extension of the portion unused on December 31 of that year for an additional one-year period. Importers may make changes among the prod- ucts specified in their import authorizations, provided that such a change does not reduce their planned purchase of domestically produced inputs. For their requirements, traders must obtain import licenses that are valid for six months, but may be extended for a three-month period with approval of both the Commerce Directorate and the Central Bank. A subsection of the licensing system is in the form of "traders' quotas," applicable to some 35 commodity groups, with special emphasis on consumer durables. Quotas are allocated on a "points system," with the most important criteria relating to firm size (employment and turnover, the latter differentiating between sales from imports and those from domestically produced goods). Geographical location, the degree of specialization, and the age of the firm are also considered in the allocation process. To meet urgent needs for their exclusive use, import- ers in particular sectors of economic activity (mainly industry and agriculture) can obtain "importer's cards" to cover goods up to a limit of D 500 a year for each importer. The limit has not been raised for a number of years, and few importers currently use this option. State-trading organizations are the exclusive importers of about one fourth of the total value of imports, some 50 percent of which are in the form of energy products. Among the important public-trading agencies are the Commerce Office (for sugar, coffee, tea), the Cereal Office (grains), Ellouhoum (meat), and the Oil Office (vegetable oil). In addition, certain food items, bever- ages, tobacco, and medical products are imported exclu- sively by other state agencies. The state-trading commis- sions meet periodically to decide on the appropriateness and timing of imports of specified products. For items that are not on the free list, state-trading agencies are required to complete the same licensing formalities as those applicable to the private sector. Manufacturing industries producing exclusively for TUNISIA export and covered by Law No. 72-38 may import freely any goods required for their production process, subject only to customs declaration. In specified cases, imports destined for domestic investment projects are eligible for fu ll or partial exemption from import du ty. Importers must have received a customs code number as a prior condition for obtaining an import certificate, an import authorization, an import license, or an import- er's card. All import documents involving payments must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Foreign currency may be purchased from the Central Bank or a delegated commercial bank for all payments that have received prior authorization. Resident importers are authorized to buy forward foreign currencies required for future settlement of their merchandise imports, for a max imum term of six months, at rates established daily by the Central Bank. In addition to customs duties, a number of import taxes are applied, the most important being a 5 percent tax to cover customs formalities. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require the approval of the Central Bank; for some transactions this authority has been delegated to the authorized banks. Payments for a number of current invisibles are freely approved provided that they are properly documented. These include (1) various payments related to interna- tional trade (e .g ., port services, warehousing, commis- sions, and brokerage); (2) payments for processing, repair, assembly, royalties, patents and trademarks, taxes, fines, and court expenses; and (3) payment of in- terest and amortization arising from authorized contrac- tual obligations to nonresidents. Approval is also given freely for remittance of dividends due to nonresidents. In addition, exporters holding balances on EFAC accounts (see section on Exports and Export Proceeds, below) may use these freely for expenditures abroad in connection with participation in international trade fairs, and to pay customs duties and various other expenses related to exports. Exporters, hotel owners, travel agencies, and other external service industries may use EFAC balances freely for expenses related to publicity abroad, and up to fixed limits for certain other expenses. Nonresident enterprises producing for export within the framework of Law No. 72-38 may freely make all their payments abroad; amounts in convertible dinars credited to the Business Travel Accounts of resident firms covered by Law No. 72-38 may be freely transferred up to D 6,000 a year for business travel; amounts unused over two consecutive years may be carried over, provided that the total of such transfers does not exceed D 10,000 in any one year. A business travel allocation may be authorized by the Central Bank for industrialists and businessmen whose professional activity requires travel abroad and who are unable to open EFAC accounts or business travel accounts based on Law No. 72-38. The annual alloca- tion for each beneficiary is in i t ia l ly determined by the Central Bank at the time of approval, taking into account 495 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TUNISIA the applicant's import turnover. In the years thereafter, the annual amount of the allocation is determined by the authorized intermediary with which the authorization is domiciled, using the same criteria. Payments for certain other current invisibles are approved up to fixed limits. Residents traveling abroad as tourists are entitled once a year to an exchange allocation equivalent to D 100 a person (D 50 for children under ten); the allocations for two consecutive years may be cumulated. Residents are entitled to a tourist allocation of 1,000 Moroccan dirhams for travel to Morocco. The monthly foreign exchange allowance for educational expenses abroad is the equivalent of D 250 for those studying in Canada and the United States, D 200 for students in Western European coun- tries, and D 140 for those in other countries. A foreign national employed under contract may transfer up to 50 percent of his net wage or salary without limit if his family is not resident in Tunisia and subject to a maximum of D 150 a month if his family lives in Tunisia.3 Foreign experts employed by the public sector may transfer abroad their monthly salaries up to the limits specified in their contracts. Foreign salaried workers born in Tunisia may transfer 30 percent of their net basic salaries, up to D 80 a month. Regardless of nationality, residents traveling abroad by air or sea are subject to a travel tax of D 30 a trip. Nonresidents, diplomats, persons traveling under the "Agence de Cooperation Technique," emigrant workers, students, pilgrims to Mecca, and those traveling for medical reasons are exempted from the tax. The export of Tunisian dinar bank notes or coin is prohibited. Unless central bank permission is obtained, the reconversion of domestic bank notes by nonresident travelers is restricted to 30 percent of the amount of foreign currency previously sold, subject to a maximum of D 100, if the traveler's stay in Tunisia exceeds 24 hours; if it does not exceed 24 hours, there is no limitation on the reconversion. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Most exports are liberalized, but certain nonenergy exports (amounting to about 12.5 percent of the total in 1984) require export licenses issued by the Ministry of National Economy. The export of wine is the monopoly of the Office du Vin, the export of cereals that of the Office des Cer6ales, and the export of olive oil that of the Office National de 1'Huile. With the exceptions noted below, all export proceeds must be repatriated and surrendered, normally within 10 days from the date payment is due if no credit is extended or, unless special authorization from the Central Bank is obtained, within 100 days after shipment if the goods are sold on credit. Central bank approval for a surrender period of up to 180 days is freely obtainable. Resident exporters may 3 There are special regulations for those employed by nonresident manufacturing enterprises covered by Law No. 72-38. 496 sell forward for a maximum term of three months, through authorized intermediaries, foreign currencies representing the proceeds from their merchandise ex- ports. Exporters, hotel owners, travel agencies, and all providers of services abroad may arrange to credit part of their export proceeds to special EFAC (Exportations- Frais Accessories) accounts denominated in convertible dinars. For exporters the limits are 4 percent if export proceeds are repatriated more than 30 days after ship- ment of the merchandise, and 6 percent if repatriation occurs within 30 days following shipment. Hotel own- ers, travel agencies, and other external services indus- tries may credit to such accounts up to 4 percent of their foreign exchange proceeds. Authorized intermediaries may grant surety bonds and performance bonds to resident exporters and to resident exporting enterprises eligible under Law No. 72-38. Resident manufacturing industries that produce exclusively for export and are approved under the terms of Law No. 72-38 may arrange to credit 2 percent of their repatriated convertible currency export proceeds to Business Travel Accounts in Convertible Dinars. Under the provisions of Law No. 72-38, nonresident manufacturing enterprises (i.e., enterprises whose capi- tal is held by nonresidents and has been constituted to the extent of at least 66 percent through the import of convertible currencies) producing exclusively for export are exempt from the requirement of repatriation and surrender of export proceeds. Proceeds from Invisibles Residents must repatriate and surrender all amounts derived from services rendered to persons resident abroad and also all other income or proceeds from invisibles received from foreign countries. However, there are certain EFAC facilities for such proceeds (see section on Exports and Export Proceeds, above). Foreign bank notes and coin (except gold coin) may be brought in freely; nonresident travelers wishing to re-export the equivalent of over D 500 must make a currency declaration upon entry. The import of Tunisian dinar bank notes and coin is prohibited. Capital All nonresidents who wish to invest in Tunisia are required to obtain the prior approval of the Tunisian authorities in order to be able to transfer the principal of, and current earnings from, such investments. Foreign investment in Tunisia may obtain the benefits provided for by the Investment Code (Law No. 69-35), by Law No. 81-56 providing incentives for investment in manufacturing industry and for industrial decentraliza- tion, and by Law No. 82-67 of August 6, 1982 providing incentives for investment in the agricultural and fishery sectors. These include a number of tax facilities as well as a guarantee of the right to repatriate foreign exchange investment capital and the net proceeds from its sale or liquidation, even if these exceed the initial foreign exchange investment, plus the income ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution from its capital. Furthermore, Law No. 72—38 provides for various special benefits for nonresident manufactur- ing enterprises, including an exemption from the repatri- ation requirement in respect of export proceeds. Law No. 76-63 provides for the establishment in Tunisia, subject to prior approval by the Ministry of Planning and Finance and the Central Bank, of foreign financial and banking institutions conducting business with nonresi- dents. However, these institutions may also grant credits to residents or take up participations in the capital of resident companies upon authorization from the Central Bank. Such institutions are regarded as nonresident for exchange control purposes; they need not repatriate any of their funds or proceeds and may freely extend credit to nonresidents for the investment and working capital requirements of enterprises in Tunisia. Foreign nationals who have been residents of Tunisia and have left Tunisia permanently are entitled to the transfer of the following: 50 percent of their assets (subject to a ceiling of D 3,500) for those who left Tunisia before August 20, 1970;4 D 4,000 for those who left between August 20, 1970 and December 31, 1973; D 5,000 for those who left between January 1, 1974 and December 31, 1974; D 10,000 for those who left after December 31, 1974; D 15,000 for those leaving Tunisia after December 31, 1978, are over 60 years of age and are Tunisian nationals; and D 25,000 for those of French nationality residing and working in Tunisia as of October 25, 1980 and who subsequently retired and left Tunisia permanently after that date. Italian citizens who have left Tunisia and who hold Capital or Suspense Accounts are authorized to transfer their holdings up to the total amount specified under the Tunisian-Italian Agreement. All capital transfers by residents and all loans to nonresidents require the approval of the Central Bank. Donations or the proceeds from inheritances accruing to nonresidents are credited to Capital Accounts under 4 Such persons may transfer D 1,750 if the total amount of their assets does not exceed D 3,500.

Gold Five denominations of commemorative gold coin are legal tender but do not circulate. Residents may acquire and hold gold in any form in Tunisia. The Central Bank has a monopoly over the import and export of monetary gold. Other imports of gold require joint authorization by the Central Bank and the Ministry of National Economy. Only dentists and specified cooperatives of industrial users are eligible to purchase gold from the Central Bank. The export of gold is prohibited. Changes During 1984 Imports and Import Payments August 17. Restrictions were eased on the importation of cars by Tunisians resident abroad. Payments for Invisibles March 21. A new travel tax, amounting to D 30 a trip, was levied on all residents traveling abroad by sea or air. Nonresidents, diplomats, persons traveling under the auspices of the "Agence de Cooperation Technique," emigrant workers, students, pilgrims to Mecca, and those traveling for medical reasons were exempted from the tax. Proceeds from Invisibles February 17. Eligibility for the opening of Exporta- tions-Frais Accessoires (EFAC) accounts, under which part of the proceeds of exports could be deposited and used for expenditures abroad, was extended to travel agencies and all providers of services abroad. (Previous eligibility was limited to exporters of goods and hotel services.) In addition, the annual ceiling on payments for travel expenditures by means of debiting such account was raised from D 2,000 to D 4,000 a year, and provision was granted for cumulating annual allocations for two consecutive years. 497 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TURKEY (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Turkey is the Turkish Lira. The authorities of Turkey do not observe margins in respect of exchange transactions, and Turkey follows a flexible exchange rate policy under which exchange rates for the lira are adjusted from time to t ime .l On December 28, 1984 the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were LT 442.50 = US$1, and LT 446.97 = US$1, respectively. Administration of Control Exchange and trade controls are the responsibility of the Prime Ministry, to which the Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade is attached. Administration of exchange controls has been delegated to the Central Bank, which regulates all matters related to foreign exchange operations. Forty-four commercial banks have been authorized by the Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade to engage in foreign exchange operations on their own account, including allocating foreign exchange for imports not subject to prior permit. In the case of imports subject to prior permit, authorized commercial banks directly allocate foreign exchange and issue import licenses upon receiving the approved import permit from the Undersecretariat of Treasury and For- eign Trade. Export registration is carried out by profes- sional organizations, according to instructions from the Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade; the Undersecretariat also issues export licenses but may delegate this authority to the professional organizations. Prescription of Currency and Nonresident Accounts Settlements under bilateral payments agreements are made in U.S. dollars. Certain commercial transactions with Czechoslovakia, Iraq, Poland, Romania, Tunisia, and the U .S .S .R ., and with the other members of the Regional Cooperation for Development are made through special accounts denominated in U.S. dollars. Settlements with all other countries are made in convert- ible currencies. Nonresidents as well as residents may open accounts denominated in foreign exchange with commercial banks authorized to deal in foreign ex- change; such accounts are disposable at the discretion of the holders. Imports and Import Payments All goods are freely importable except those explicitly prohibited or subject to prior permit. The current import Commercial banks are free to establish their own exchange rates within a band of ± 6 percent around a "central rate" established daily by the Central Bank; the spread between the buying and selling rates of a commercial bank may not exceed 2 percent. For its own transactions with commercial banks and with the nonbank sector, the Central Bank sets up daily buying and selling rates which fall within the spread established by leading banks. A wider band of ± 8 percent is permitted for transactions in bank notes. 498 regime consists of three lists of goods: (1) the first list ("Negative" list) includes items under slightly over 200 tariff lines, whose importation is prohibited; the list is mostly composed of foodstuffs, leather and leather goods, textiles and clothing, and other finished products. Except for narcotics, weapons and ammunition, the importation of goods included in this list may be permitted on a case-by-case basis when used in produc- tion for export; (2) the second list contains articles under some 370 tariff lines which may be imported only with specific authorization (prior permit) from the Undersec- retariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade; it consists mainly of raw materials, spare parts, intermediate goods and tools for industry, and electrical equipment; and (3) the third list, or "Fund" list, includes items under more than 100 tariff lines which can be freely imported with payment of a special levy (in most cases specific) in addition to customs duties; this list is chiefly made up of luxury consumer goods. The importation of all goods not included in any of the above lists is freely permitted with payment of customs duties. However, imports of old, used and reconditioned, defective, substandard, soiled, or poor quality goods may only be made with special permission given on a project basis by the State Planning Organization. Imports from countries where foreign trade is nationalized may only be carried out by the public sector for its own needs, or by individual companies with annual earnings of at least US$50 million. All imports by the public sector have to be authorized by the Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade. All commercial imports require import licenses, which are valid for six months. The validity of an import license may be extended by an authorized commercial bank for up to 12 additional months and can be further extended by the Undersecretariat of Treasury and For- eign Trade. Import licenses are issued to registered importers, industrialists, state economic enterprises, and government departments. In the case of freely import- able items, including those in the "Fund" list, no special permit is required to apply for an import license to any authorized bank. In the case of imports subject to special permit, import licenses are issued by the Central Bank or any authorized bank upon approval granted by the Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade.2 The import license permits the necessary foreign ex- change payment to be made. Payments for imports may be made against letters of credit, documents, or goods (i.e., upon customs clearance), or by way of acceptance 2 The requirement under the previous regime of prior approval from other Ministries in the case of imports subject to special licensing has been eliminated, with the exception of imports of medicines, pes- ticides, or raw materials used in their production, which are subject to control by the Ministry of Health and Social Aid, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Rural Affa irs, respectively. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution credits; partial prepayments are authorized under certain conditions. Under the new import regime, restrictions concerning means of import payment have been reduced, the requirement to prepay in local currency the equiva- lent of the foreign exchange value of a letter of credit application has been eliminated, the obligation to deposit 20 percent of the local currency counterpart of the consignment at the time of applying for an import license in the case of payment against goods has been abolished, and restrictions previously imposed on import financing through acceptance credits has been eliminated. Guarantee deposits must be made by the importer before the import license is issued, and are refunded after the goods are cleared through customs and the foreign payment made; these deposits do not earn interest. Since early 1983, the general guarantee deposit rate stands at 15 percent of the foreign exchange requested, which is applicable to imports by commercial importers. A special rate of 7.5 percent is applicable to industrialists' own import requirements and to public sector imports; there is also a deposit rate of one percent applicable to imports of a number of specific goods, and, since 1984, to imports for the Izmir International Fair, and imports financed through acceptance credits. Exporters who made use of their own foreign exchange accounts to pay for imports not subject to prior authorization are ex- empted from placement of guarantee deposits; they are also exempted from this requirement for up to the equivalent of 20 percent of the foreign exchange held in such accounts in the case of imports subject to prior authorization. Regulations concerning imports without allocation of foreign exchange by the banking system mainly affect imports of goods for personal or professional use by travelers domiciled in Turkey, temporary imports by foreign contractors and diplomats, and imports by Turkish workers employed abroad and maintaining foreign exchange accounts with the Central Bank. Customs duties range mostly up to 15 percent in the case of raw materials, between 10 and 30 percent for intermediate and semifinished products, and between 30 and 40 percent for finished goods; higher rates apply to a number of luxury consumer goods. Imported goods are also subject to : (1) a municipal tax of 15 percent of the applicable customs duty; (2) a stamp duty of one percent of the declared value; (3) a quay duty of 5 percent on the sum of c .i .f. value, customs duty, municipal tax and customs clearance expense; and (4) a production tax of up to 75 percent, levied on the sum of c.i.f. value, customs duty, municipal tax, customs clearance ex- pense, and quay duty. In addition, goods under the Fund list are subject to special import levies set by the Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade; most of these levies are set on a specific basis. A 5 percent import surcharge is levied on certain iron, steel, and plastic products from the European Community. Payments for Invisibles Specific Central Bank authorization is required only for a limited type of operation; all other invisible TURKEY transactions are handled by commercial banks w i th in norms issued by the Central Bank. Foreign exchange is in general granted liberally, provided that requests are accompanied by specific documentation. The following operations are subject to specific licensing by the Central Bank: business expenses of Turkish firms abroad, transfers related to copyrights for scientific and artistic works (up to US$10,000 may be provided in advance by the Central Bank), proceeds of foreign air transportation companies, payments related to insurance, revenue of foreign consulates, and government expenses. The trans- fer of income related to foreign investment and the payment of interest on foreign credits are permitted freely within the terms of Foreign Capital Law No. 6224 and similar laws and regulations. All resident Turkish nationals may travel abroad without proof of exchange allocation by commercial banks. Banks are allowed to allocate up to US$1,000 per person per trip for tourist travel or US$500 per person per trip for travelers under 18 years of age. Foreign nationals domiciled in Turkey may purchase from banks foreign exchange for up to US$200 per trip. For business travel, the allowance is up to US$2,000 a person a trip. Special limits, as well as administrative norms, are in force for the purchase of foreign exchange for travel and other expenses related to medical treatment, study and other training, and assistance to conferences. Outbound travelers are subject to a tax equivalent to US$100, payable in Turkish liras, regardless of whether there are related purchases of foreign exchange; the tax is reduced by one half in the case of travelers 18 years of age or younger. Exempted from payment of this tax are: (i) all foreign nationals; (ii) participants in pilgrimages to Mecca; (iii) Turkish workers employed abroad and their families, crews of ships and planes, and truck drivers; (iv) those living in border areas and who may leave the country by Administrative Permits; and (v) those going abroad for medical treatment and their escorts. Travelers are permitted to take out up to the Turkish lira equivalent of US$1,000 in Turkish bank notes and coins. Nonresidents may take out without restriction the unspent portion of the foreign exchange which they brought in. Provided that the foreign exchange was declared at the time of entry, nonresident travelers can reconvert liras into foreign currency upon presentation of a document showing that foreign exchange had prev- iously been sold to an authorized dealer in Turkey; documentary evidence is not required for foreign ex- change not exceeding US$100. Persons domiciled abroad may freely take abroad with them foreign exchange in excess of US$3,000 or its equivalent, provided that such amounts were declared on arrival. Exports and Export Proceeds Commercial exports fall into the following categories: (1) exports subject to permission, including re-exports, transit trade, etc.; (2) exports subject to license, which apply to all items (rice, fodder, crude vegetable oils, oil- seeds, hides and furs, certain livestock, and a few other 499 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TURKEY items); (3) exports subject to registration, including exports on consignment or on joint account, exports on credit, and exports related to bilateral agreements; and (4) exports from free zones in or outside Turkey or from duty-free warehouses which are not subject to permis- sion, license, or registration. Barter trade is prohibited, except in permitted cases. Authorized public sector agencies and export companies with export earnings of at least US$50 million a calendar year may enter into barter trade. The surrender requirement for foreign exchange earn- ings in the case of merchandise exports is 80 percent. Foreign exchange not surrendered may be deposited in foreign exchange accounts with commercial banks, left abroad, or otherwise disposed of. The maximum period allowed for the surrender of at least 80 percent of export proceeds is three months from the date of export. Exporters receive a number of subsidies through credit and fiscal incentives. Domestic credit extended to exporters carries preferential interest rates. The rate of interest charged on such credits is 45 percent. Under an export tax rebate scheme, direct and indirect taxes paid are refunded in the case of industrial exports; the rates of rebate as of the end of 1984 ranged from 2.75 percent to 11 percent of export value. Proceeds from Invisibles The repatriation of foreign exchange accruing to residents for services rendered by them to nonresidents is mandatory. These foreign exchange earnings may be: (1) totally or partially sold to banks; (2) deposited in foreign exchange accounts with commercial banks; or (3) transferred to other parties in Turkey or abroad. Individuals residing in Turkey may accept foreign currency from nonresidents for transactions processed in Turkey. There are no limits on the importation of Turkish bank notes and coins. The importation of foreign currency is unrestricted. Capital Nonresident individuals and corporations wishing to invest in Turkey must import the required capital in the form of foreign exchange and must obtain a license from the Foreign Capital Department of the State Planning Organization. Exempt from the requirement to bring in capital in the form of foreign exchange are certain investments made in accordance with the provisions of the Law for the Encouragement of Foreign Investments or the Petroleum Law, or investments authorized to be made through the use of blocked funds by the Foreign Capital Department. Proceeds of sale and liquidation of foreign capital may be transferred out of the country on the approval of the Foreign Capital Department, which should inform the Central Bank of the amount to be transferred. Resident individuals or corporations may invest abroad up to the equivalent of US$3 million in cash or in kind with the authorization from the Undersec- retariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade; higher amounts 500 must be approved by the Council of Ministers unless the investment is financed by foreign currency obtained outside Turkey. Individuals or corporations authorized to invest and conduct commercial activities abroad must provide information of their activities to the Undersec- retariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade, including the submission of an annual report of activities at the end of the calendar year. Reasonable income from real estate and proceeds from real estate sales not exceeding the value of related foreign exchange inflow can be transferred abroad through the banks upon presentation of documents showing previous inflow equal to at least the initial property value. Income from real estate acquired without conversion of foreign exchange can be used in Turkey in the form of local currency but cannot be transferred abroad; such funds can be kept in blocked accounts at the Central Bank. Blocked funds are those accrued or accruing to nonresidents but not transferable under existing exchange control regulations. These funds may be used in Turkey for authorized investments, for living expenses of owners and relatives (up to certain ceilings), contributions to public organizations, etc. Commercial banks authorized to operate in foreign exchange on their own account may open "exchange accounts" or "convertible Turkish lira accounts" for individuals residing in Turkey or abroad. Funds in such accounts may be freely disposed of by the holders, and interest rates and other conditions on the above accounts are freely negotiable between the parties. Commercial banks are free to conduct foreign exchange transactions according to their needs. The minimum and maximum amount of foreign exchange that they can hold in their correspondent accounts depend on the levels of their short-term liabilities: the minimum retainable amount of foreign exchange is 20 percent of their foreign exchange assets; above this amount there is no requirement to surrender as long as gross holdings of foreign exchange do not exceed 40 percent of a bank's short-term foreign exchange liabilities. Any excess must be sold in the Interbank Market or surrendered to the Central Bank. Commercial banks approved by the Prime Ministry may obtain the following types of foreign loans: (a) term credit provided directly, within a maximum maturity of one year; and (b) intermediated prefinancing commodity and acceptance credits. The banks may also guarantee foreign borrowing operations by the nonbank private sector authorized by the State Planning Organization under the terms for approved investment projects. Large export companies may obtain directly foreign loans carrying maturities of up to two years with the authoriza- tion of the Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade. Under certain conditions, banks and nonbank residents may engage in foreign lending operations, in some cases with the prior approval of the Undersec- retariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade. There is a Foreign Exchange Risk Insurance Scheme (FERIS), designed to provide domestic borrowers with ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TURKEY an exchange rate guarantee for approved foreign borrow- ing. At present foreign borrowing under the scheme is on-lent in Turkish lira at a domestic interest rate below prevailing interest rates. The difference between the interest rate on the foreign borrowing and any bank commission and the domestic interest rate charged is credited to the scheme. The difference between the lira cost of the loan at the time it is contracted and the lira cost of repayments is covered from resources of the scheme. Gold The Central Bank of Turkey is authorized to carry out exports of unprocessed gold from Turkey and imports of gold to Turkey. Beginning from December 17, 1984, import and export of processed precious metals, stones, and goods for commercial purposes are subject to regulations within the export and import regime. Pur- chases and sales of gold are carried out by the Central Bank of Turkey. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement January 3. The wide-ranging changes in the exchange and trade system announced on December 29, 1983, came into effect. Capital April 14. A Foreign Exchange Risk Insurance Scheme was established, designed to provide domestic borrowers with an exchange rate guarantee for approved foreign borrowing. 501 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution UGANDA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Uganda is the Uganda Shilling. The official exchange rate of the Uganda shilling against the U .S. dollar is determined at weekly auctions held by the Bank of Uganda, taking into account private demand for foreign exchange in relation to available supply for current international transactions. The Bank of Uganda rarely deals in foreign currencies1 other than deutsche mark, pounds sterling, U .S. dollars, and Japanese yen. On December 31, 1984 the official buying and selling rates were U Sh 517.92 and U Sh 523.12, respectively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates for other currencies are determined on the basis of the cross rates for the U .S. dollar in the international market. Government ministries and departments are forbidden to bid at the foreign exchange auction; their quarterly access to sales of foreign exchange is subject to a limit of 22 percent of all sales of foreign exchange. In its foreign exchange dealings, the Bank of Uganda charges a commission of 0.4 percent buying and 0.6 percent selling. Authorized commercial banks in Uganda deal in all specified currencies2 at rates quoted by the Bank of Uganda or, for a currency not quoted, at rates calculated according to prevailing cross rates. Authorized banks may, subject to exchange control approval, deal forward with customers in sterling, U .S. dollars, and other currencies, provided that there is an underlying approved import or export contract. Authorized foreign exchange dealers impose a service charge of not more than 0.5 percent. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control The Bank of Uganda administers exchange control on behalf of the Minister of Finance. Import and export control is administered by the Ministry of Commerce. The Minister of Commerce has powers to prohibit imports and exports. Prescription of Currency The Bank of Uganda holds reciprocal accounts with the central banks of Kenya and Tanzania, which are settled in U .S. dollars. Authorized payments, including payments for imports, by residents of Uganda to resi- dents of foreign countries other than Israel and South Africa may be made in Uganda shillings to the credit of an External Account in Uganda, or in any other currency that is appropriate to the country of residence of the payee. Receipts from such countries may be obtained in 1 Foreign currencies are all currencies other than the Uganda shilling. 2 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish and Faeroese kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, U .S. dollars, and all currencies of the former Sterling Area other than the Uganda sh i l l ing. 502 Uganda shillings from an External Account in Uganda or in any convertible currency. Payments to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Certain settlements with Burund i, Rwanda, and Zaire are channeled through special accounts. External Accounts Accounts in Uganda shillings held by residents of foreign countries are designated External Accounts. They may be credited freely with authorized payments by residents of Uganda, with transfers from other External Accounts, and with the proceeds from sales of any foreign currency and gold by nonresidents of Uganda to authorized dealers. They may be debited freely for payments to nonresidents, for transfers to other External Accounts in Uganda, and for purchases of foreign currencies from authorized dealers. Nontransferable funds of persons not resident in Uganda are credited to Blocked Accounts maintained with commercial banks. Subject to prior approval, balances on Blocked Accounts may be used for the purchase in Uganda of specified bonds and shares issued in Uganda; the redemption proceeds of government bonds so acquired are transferable beginning five years from the date of purchase. Subject to individual permis- sion, such balances may also be used for payments to residents not related to export transactions. Convertible Currency Accounts Private Ugandan nationals or institutions with funds abroad may be authorized to operate Convertible Cur- rency Accounts with commercial banks in Uganda. Intending operators of such accounts are required to disclose the sources of the funds and to put up a minimum of the equivalent of US$5,000 to open the account. These accounts can be freely debited, and other governing regulations are similar to those for the regime of External Accounts (see above). The minimum balance in each such account must be at least US$3,000, below which the account is liable to closure by the Bank of Uganda. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Israel and South Africa are pro- hibited. Most imports are controlled through import licensing. Import licenses are issued by the Ugandan Advisory Board of Trade (UABT) under the Minister of Commerce; a commission of 0.5 percent of license value is levied by the UABT. These licenses are issued freely for all nonprohibited imports. With the exception of repeater and proprietary imports, anyone wishing to import goods valued in excess of US$20,000 is required to submit to the UABT pro forma invoices from three different suppliers. Imports normally must be pur- chased directly from the country of origin. Documentary ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution evidence showing that the goods have been imported into Uganda must be forwarded to the exchange control authorities within four months from the date of payment in the case of goods shipped by surface transportation, and within two months for goods brought into the country by air. A monthly foreign exchange budget is prepared by a Committee headed by the chairman of the Presidential Economic Advisory Committee, and is approved by the Minister of Finance. Subject to prior approval by the Bank, imports of specified types of capital goods are permitted on a consignment basis. All bids for foreign exchange at the auction must be accompanied by bank checks in Uganda shillings equiva- lent to the total bids at their respective rates. Bidders are reimbursed for the excess of their bids over their actual domestic currency payments as computed on the basis of the auction clearing rate. Successful bidders are required to buy Tax Deposit Receipts bearing market rates of interest, equivalent to the fu ll value of the applicable customs and sales taxes before receiving the corre- sponding foreign exchange. Foreign exchange alloca- tions to various ministries and departments must be backed by documents showing approval of the Central Tender Board, an original budget authorization, and the signature of the Secretary of the Treasury or a duly designated officer. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to all countries are subject to approval by the Bank of Uganda; payments to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. For business travel a daily allowance of US$150 a person is granted, up to an annual limit of US$2,000 a person. The maximum yearly travel allowance for purposes other than business is US$500 a person. Expatriates working in Uganda may obtain allocations for travel outside Uganda at the time of their overseas leave subject to the terms of the original contract. Foreign exchange is not normally released for nursery, primary, and secondary education abroad, except for post-secondary education. Allowances for post-secondary education abroad are based on estimates of tuition fees, board and lodging, and incidental expenses; foreign exchange is not normally provided when a comparable level of instruction is provided in Uganda. Facilities exist whereby salaried foreign nation- als may remit to their country of origin up to one third of their gross monthly earnings to cover family mainte- nance, savings, etc., provided that they are on a contract of employment which includes a firm commitment to leave Uganda upon expiry of the contract. At this time, they may also remit a further US$5,000. Allowances for medical and advertising expenses are considered on a case-by-case basis. Applications to remit profits, divi- dends, and interest payments are automatically ap- proved; however, some arrears incurred on profits and dividends prior to the opening of the dual market remain outstanding. Payments by the private nonbank sector for all other invisible transactions and for certain capital transfers are UGANDA subject to a combined limit specified below in the section on Capital. There are arrears in respect of the servicing of public external debt. The export of Uganda bank notes and coin by travelers is prohibited, except that travelers may take out U Sh 3,000 in Uganda currency. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Exports require licenses from the UABT and may be restricted to ensure sufficient supplies for consumption in Uganda. The Uganda Tea Authority has a monopoly over the export of tea, the Coffee Marketing Board over the export of coffee, and the Lint Marketing Board over the export of raw cotton. Export proceeds in specified currencies (see foot- note 2) must be collected within four months for goods shipped overseas and within two months for goods exported to neighboring countries or by air to any destination, and sold to an authorized bank for Uganda shillings. The authorized bank must in turn surrender these proceeds to the Bank of Uganda within three business days, failure of which entails payment of interest at a rate of 5 percent above the LIBOR. Coffee and cotton are subject to export duty. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in specified currencies (see footnote 2) must be sold to an authorized bank within 48 hours. The import of Uganda bank notes and coin by travelers is prohibited, except that returning residents may bring in U Sh 3,000 a person. Travelers may freely bring in bank notes denominated in specified currencies and foreign currency traveler's checks. Capital Capital transfers to all countries require individual exchange control approval and those to Israel and South Africa are prohibited. Foreign assets must be deposited with an authorized depository, except that residents of Uganda may be granted exemption in respect of specified former Sterling Area assets held prior to June 11, 1965. Residents of Uganda leaving perma- nently may normally transfer their assets up to the equivalent of US$10,000 a family unit from their declared assets. Amounts in excess of this are placed in a Blocked Account and invested in Government of Uganda securities. The principal is transferred after a period of five years; the accrued interest is also released but not remitted. Principal payments on nonguaranteed overseas borrowing by resident companies or individuals are transferable. There are no restrictions on nonguaranteed overseas borrowing by resident companies or individu- als. Foreign investment is permitted in Uganda with or without government participation. Certain industries, such as public utilities, transportation, telecommunica- tions, shipping, and the marketing of key commodities, are wholly reserved for government ownership. In other 503 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution UGANDA key industries, such as textiles, brewing, animal feed manufacture, the dairy industry, and tourism, the Gov- ernment may pre-empt a certain percentage of the ownership but does accept private investment from both domestic and foreign sources. To secure a guarantee of repatriation, it is necessary to obtain "approved status" for the investment in terms of the Foreign Investments (Protection) Act, 1964; in normal circumstances, ap- proved status is given freely. Foreign and domestic investment in specified types of production requires approval under the Licensing Act of 1969. All imports and exports of securities require approval. Approval is freely granted for the purchase by nonresi- dents of Ugandan securities, provided that payment is received in an appropriate manner. The income from such securities is remittable, and the proceeds on resale are normally remittable also. A resident of Uganda may not send money abroad, for whatever purpose, without specific exchange control approval. Prior exchange control approval is required for loans or overdraft facilities granted to a nonresident or to a corporate body resident in Uganda that is controlled, directly or indi- rectly, by persons resident outside Uganda. Payments by the private nonbank sector for all other capital transfers and all invisible payments not specified above are freely permitted up to an aggregate maximum allowance of US$500 a person a year, provided there is adequate evidence to support the application. Gold A commemorative gold coin with a face value of U Sh 500 is legal tender but in practice does not circulate. Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Uganda for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and autho- rized industrial and professional users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in Uganda in any form other than jewelry. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler require licenses issued by the Ministry of Finance. Export licenses are not normally granted except for exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. The import of the following from all sources is subject to individual licensing: jewelry of gold, silver, or platinum; goldsmiths' or silversmiths' wares, including set gems; bullion in the form of ingot, bar, or sheet; and gold coin. Import licenses for gold bullion, gold jewelry, and gold coin are issued restric- tively and only to goldsmiths. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement June 15. The exchange rate was unified at the weekly auction clearing rate, and it was announced that, in relevant cases, bidders would be reimbursed for the excess of their bids over their actual domestic currency payments, as computed on the basis of the auction clearing rate, by means of nonrediscountable 91-day treasury bills. November 9. The foreign exchange auction for the week ending November 16 was suspended, and upon its resumption in the following week, the auction started to be operated with a one-week lag in relation to the submission of the bids. Successful bidders were to receive foreign exchange only after purchasing Tax Deposit Receipts equivalent to the fu ll value of the applicable import duty and sales tax. In addition, the reimbursement of excess bids in the form of nonredis- countable treasury bills was suspended. Imports and Import Payments May 7. Subject to prior approval by the Bank of Uganda, authorization was granted for importers to import specified types of capital goods on a consignment basis. November 9. A regulation was introduced, specifying that anyone wishing to import goods with a value in excess of US$20,000 should submit to the Ugandan Advisory Board of Trade (UABT) pro forma invoices from three different suppliers before licenses could be granted. The requirement would be waived in the case of repeater and proprietary imports. (Repeater imports were defined as goods imported from the same supplier by the same importer, and proprietary imports as goods for which the supplier had a patent or monopoly franchise.) Payments for Invisibles February 15. It was announced that, pending a review of policy, banks should not accept applications from expatriates wishing to remit abroad up to the existing limit of one third of their salaries. (This change in regulation was rescinded on March 15, 1984.) Other May 7. Permission was granted for authorized dealers to issue (accept) East African traveler's checks to (from) residents traveling in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, at prevailing rates of exchange. 504 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution UNITED ARAB EMIRATES1 (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the United Arab Emirates is the U .A .E. Dirham, which is pegged to the SDR at Dh 4.76190 = SDR 1. The United Arab Emirates has established margins of 7.25 percent around the official rate; since November 1980, the U .A .E dirham has maintained an unchanged relationship with the U .S. dollar, involving wider margins. The U.S. dollar is the intervention currency, and the Central Bank publishes buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar only. On December 31, 1984 the official buying and selling rates were Dh 3.6690 and Dh 3.6730, respectively, per US$1. The Central Bank sets no limits on the amount of U .S. dollars that it is prepared to buy from or sell to any commercial bank. Commercial banks are free to enter into foreign exchange transactions at rates of their own choosing; the rates quoted by commercial banks for currencies other than the U.S. dollar are determined on the basis of international quotations. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. There is a swap facility at the Central Bank which the commercial banks may use to purchase dirhams spot and sell dirhams forward for periods of one week, one month, and three months. For each bank, maximum limits of US$20 million outstanding for one-month and three-month swaps and US$10 million outstanding for one-week swaps are in effect. There is also a limit of US$3 million in purchases a day for each bank for one- month and three-month swaps. Swap facilities are not available to banks having a short position in dirhams except for the covering of forward transactions for commercial purposes. The United Arab Emirates formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, on February 13, 1974. Administration of Control There is neither exchange control legislation nor an exchange control authority in the United Arab Emirates, and there are no registration requirements for inward or outward transfers. There is no regime of export and import licensing. Prescription of Currency All settlements with Israel and South Africa are prohibited. No other prescription of currency require- ments are in force. Nonresident Accounts No distinction is made between accounts held by residents and those held by nonresidents. 1 The seven federated states of the United Arab Emirates are Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm al Qaiwain, Ras al Kh a im ah, and Fujairah. Imports and Import Payments Imports from South Africa and Israel are prohibited, as are imports of products manufactured by foreign companies blacklisted by the Arab League. Imports of a few commodities are prohibited from all sources for health or security reasons. Virtually all other com- modities may be freely imported without an individual import permit, but only licensed parties can enter the import trade and an importer can import only the commodities specified in his license. There are no restrictions on the availability of foreign exchange for payments in respect of permitted imports. With the exception of specified items, imports into the United Arab Emirates are subject to a customs duty of 4 percent of the c .i .f. value. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports and re-exports to South Africa and Israel are prohibited. Virtually all commodities may be exported or re-exported freely and without an export license, to any destination, other than South Africa and Israel. Each Emirate establishes its own export regulations. The proceeds from exports need not be repatriated or surrendered and may be disposed of freely, regardless of the currency involved. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles All payments for current invisibles may be made freely, with the exception of payments to South Africa and Israel, which are prohibited. There are no require- ments governing receipts. Travelers may take out and bring in any amount in foreign or domestic bank notes. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or payments by residents or nonresidents. Not less than 70 percent of corporate shares of financial institutions (excluding banks) must be held by nationals or organizations of the United Arab Emirates; the chairman and two thirds of the board of directors must also be nationals of the United Arab Emirates. Profits on foreign capital invested in the United Arab Emirates may be remitted freely. Banks operating in the United Arab Emirates are required to maintain special deposits with the Central Bank equal to 30 percent of their placements with or lending to nonresident banks in dirhams with a remaining life of one year or less. In accordance with a prior central bank law still in effect, the profits of certain banks are subject to a fee levied by local authorities at an annual rate of 20 percent. Central Bank swap facilities are not made available to banks having a short position in dirhams, except for the covering of forward transactions for commercial purposes. 505 ©International Monetary Fund.

Not for Redistribution UNITED KINGDOM (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the United Kingdom is the Pound Sterling. The authorities of the United Kingdom do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions, and the exchange rate is determined largely by the balance of market forces. Whether the rate is rising or falling, intervention by the authorities is limited to smoothing operations to moderate excessive fluctuations and preserve orderly markets. The closing selling and buying rates in the foreign exchange market for the U.S. dollar on December 31, 1984 were US$1.1575 and US$1.1585, respectively, per £1. Banks are allowed to engage in spot and forward exchange transactions in any currency, and they may deal among themselves and with residents and nonresidents in foreign notes and coin at free market rates of exchange. The United Kingdom formally accepted the obliga- tions of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from February 15, 1961. Administration of Control Exchange controls have been abolished. The licensing of imports and exports is handled mostly by the Department of Trade and Industry, but other departments also issue licenses in specialized fields.

Banks may freely accept foreign currency deposits and employ them in their foreign currency business or convert them to sterling, subject to prudential guidelines issued by the Bank of England concerning the limitation of risks arising from their foreign exchange exposure. Net spot liabilities in foreign currencies (i.e., the net amount of foreign currency resources funding sterling assets) form part of a bank's eligible liabilities that are subject to a V* of 1 percent noninterest-bearing deposit requirement with the Bank of England and may also be subject to calls for special deposits to be placed with the Bank. There is currently no special deposit call. Gold Gold bullion and gold coin are not subject to control in the United Kingdom. Gold sovereigns are legal tender but do not circulate. Gold coins have also been issued in Jersey and the Isle of Man and are legal tender there. Except under license granted by the Treasury, it is an offense to melt down or break up any metal coin which is for the time being current in the United Kingdom or which, having been current there, has at any time after May 16, 1969 ceased to be so. The export of gold in manufactured form over 50 years old and valued at £8,000 and over for each item or matching set of items also requires a license from the Department of Trade and Industry. There is a free gold market in London in which gold bars are freely traded. The U .K. authorities do not intervene in the market as either buyers or sellers.

Not for Redistribution UNITED STATES (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the United States is the U .S. Dollar. The U .S. authorities do not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions, and spot and forward exchange rates are determined on the basis of demand and supply conditions in the exchange markets. However, the authorities intervene when necessary to counter disor- derly conditions in the exchange markets. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. The United States formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agree- ment, as from December 10, 1946. Administration of Control1 The Department of the Treasury administers licensing programs involving direct or indirect financial or com- mercial transactions with Cuba, Democratic Kampu- chea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Viet Nam or their nationals, as specified under the Foreign Assets Control Regulations and the Cuban Assets Control Regulations. It also has administrative re- sponsibility for blocked accounts of the above countries as well as accounts2 of Estonia, the German Democratic Republic, Latvia, and Lithuania, blocked since World War II under the Foreign Funds Control Regulations.3 The Customs Service of the Treasury Department administers import quotas; such quotas, however, are frequently established or allocated by other agencies. The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agree- ments, chaired by the Department of Commerce, with representatives from other agencies, decides when to request consultation with countries to limit imports on the basis of the guidelines of the Multifiber Arrangement and bilateral restraint agreements. Import quotas on specified dairy products are administered by the Depart- ment of Agriculture through the issuance of import licenses. Global quotas on sugar are set on a quarterly basis by the Secretary of Agriculture. For items subject to export control —other than crude petroleum and !On May 7, 1985, the United States imposed an embargo on trade w i th Nicaragua, along with restrictions on dealings with Nicaraguan air carriers and Nicaraguan-registered vessels. Payments related to pro- hibited transactions, inc lud ing payments for prohibited imports and exports, were prohibited under the Nicaraguan Trade Control Regula- tions, wh ich were issued in implementation of the embargo. 2Under the agreement on settlement of claims, concluded between the United States and Czechoslovakia in 1981, blocked accounts between the two countries were unblocked in March 1982. 3 Restrictions on payments to the Islamic Republic of Iran, except for payments from Iranian assets blocked as of January 19, 1981, were revoked on January 19, 1981, pursuant to Executive Orders and regulations issued thereunder. Iranian assets blocked as of January 19, 1981 have, w i th limited exceptions, been transferred to the Islamic Republic of Iran or to various escrow accounts as set forth in the January 19, 1981 agreements between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran. 510 petroleum products and munitions —the Department of Commerce is, in general, the responsible authority. There are no restrictions on foreign payments, except those imposed under Treasury Department regulations for security reasons on transactions involving the author- ities or nationals of Cuba, Democratic Kampuchea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Viet Nam and, to a very limited extent (see footnote 3), certain assets of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, its agencies, instrumentalities, and controlled entities. However, certain payments to the first four countries related to authorized travel there are permitted, as are certain payments in connection with travel to and in the United States by nationals of these countries. Limited remittances to the remitter's close relatives in Cuba and Viet Nam are also permitted. Imports and Import Payments Imports originating in Cuba, Democratic Kampuchea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Viet Nam are prohibited under treasury regulations, unless specifically authorized. Import quotas are in effect for (1) cotton, certain cotton waste and products, most dairy products, and peanuts; (2) certain fish and certain potatoes (tariff-rate quotas); (3) sugar and certain sugar products; and (4) certain specialty steel products. Moreover, quotas may be imposed by the President under specified conditions on certain types of meat. Among the quantita- tive import quotas, all except those for peanuts, certain cotton products, butter, oil, sugar and certain sugar products, and certain specialty steel products are on a country-of-production basis. Certain dairy products that are subject to quotas are also subject to import licensing. Imports of heavyweight motorcycles are subject to tariff quotas. The United States is a party to the GATT Multifiber Arrangement (MFA) and to 29 bilateral textile agree- ments negotiated in accordance w i th the Arrangement's provisions. These agreements control trading partners' exports of textiles and apparel to the United States, and provide for orderly expansion of trade without disrupting U .S. markets for these products. Imports from both agreement and nonagreement countries are monitored along with domestic industry performance to determine if market disruption exists. When necessary, consulta- tions are requested to establish quota limitations. Imports of textiles and textile products are subject to rules of origin issued by the U .S. Customs Service in the Department of the Treasury. Imports of crude petroleum and petroleum products originating in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya are prohibited.

The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) scheme went into operation in the United States in January 1976 and is scheduled to continue through Ju ly 4, 1993. Under a procedure referred to as "product graduation," eligibil- ity can be withdrawn from certain countries on a product-by-product basis. Cumulative treatment under the GSP scheme is extended to members of the Andean Group, of the ASEAN and of CARICOM: cumulation allows two or more member countries of an eligible association to contribute jointly to the requirement that at least 35 percent of the direct cost of producing a given product should originate in the beneficiary country. During the nine years ended in December 1984, du ty- free imports by the United States under the scheme have increased from US$3.2 billion to US$13 billion. Under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act, 20 coun- tries and entities4 have been designated to receive preferential tariff treatment on specified imports for the period through September 30, 1995. Exports and Export Proceeds Munitions may be exported only under license issued by the Office of Munitions Control in the Department of State. Licenses are required for exports of crime control and detection equipment, as well as instruments and related technical data, to all countries except other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Australia, Japan, and New Zealand. The Department of Commerce administers controls directly on exports from the United States and on re-exports of goods of U .S. origin from any area. (The Treasury Department administers controls on exports to certain areas of goods of foreign origin by foreign firms that are owned or controlled by U .S. nationals.) All exports to Cuba, Democratic Kampuchea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Viet Nam (w i th the exception of certain publicly available techn- ical data and educational materials, personal baggage, and limited gift parcels) are prohibited unless individu- ally licensed by the Department of Commerce. Exports to all other countries, except Canada, of designated strategic materials and equipment require individual validated licenses from the Department of Commerce. For many commodities, when exported to countries other than Afghanistan, member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), Cuba, Democratic Kampuchea, the Democratic People's Re- public of Korea, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamah ir iya, and Viet Nam, single distribution licenses may be obtained to cover a fu ll year's sh ipmen t. The licensing requirements UNITED STATES applicable to Yugoslavia are less restrictive than those applicable to other Eastern European countries. Under the Export Administration Act of 1979, which has expired but whose statutory and regulatory provi- sions remain in force by virtue of the President's invocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the President can suspend the export of goods for reasons of national security, foreign policy, or short supply in the domestic economy, although efforts are made to minimize the use of such authority. For agricultural commodities, such as wheat, corn, sorghum, soybeans, and soybean oil, exporting companies are required to participate in a reporting system that is designed to improve market information and to allow for more orderly exporting and, thereby, lessen substantially the need for government intervention. The proceeds of exports are not subject to exchange control. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments and transfers abroad may be made free ly, except for payments to or for the account of the authorities or nationals of Cuba, Democratic Kam- puchea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Viet Nam, which are permitted only under license.5 U .S. residents are allowed to remit up to US$500 a quarter to close relatives in Cuba and US$300 a quarter to close relatives in Viet Nam. In addition, remittances of up to US$500 to Cuba and US$750 to Viet Nam are allowed to aid in a relative's emigration from those countries. Receipts of funds from Cuba, Democratic Kampuchea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Viet Nam are generally prohibited, except as authorized. Certain transactions in connection w i th authorized travel in these countries are permitted. Indi- viduals leaving or entering the United States w i th more than US$5,000 in domestic or foreign currency, travel- er's checks, money orders, or bearer-form negotiable securities must declare these to the customs at the point of exit or entry. Capital Incoming or outgoing capital payments by residents or nonresidents are not subject to exchange control. In addition, inward and outward direct or portfolio invest- ment is generally free of any other form of approval requirement.

In addition, ownership of U .S. farmland by foreign nationals or by U .S. corporations of which 5 percent or more is foreign- owned must be reported to the U .S. Department of Agriculture. Certain states in the United States impose varying restrictions on purchases of land w i th in their borders by foreign nationals. Member banks are discouraged by the Federal Reserve Board from soliciting or encouraging placement of deposits by U .S. residents at their foreign branches, unless such deposits are placed to serve a definite, necessary purpose outside the United States. The foreign currency positions of banks, whether overall or with respect to individual currencies, are not subject to prudential limitations of a quantitative nature, but banks are expected to follow normal banking practices and not maintain imprudent positions. U .S. agencies and branches of foreign banks, as well as domestic banksr are subject to reserve requirements by the Federal Reserve system. Beginning December 3, 1981, U .S. chartered deposit- ory institutions, U .S. offices of Edge and Agreement Corporations,6 and U .S. branches and agencies of foreign banks may establish international banking facili- ties (IBFs) in the United States. IBFs may accept deposits only from foreign residents (including foreign offices of domestic banks), from other IBFs, or from the institution establishing the IBF. Such funds are exempt from reserve requirements of Regulation D and from interest rate limitations of Regulation Q. For nonbank foreign residents, the m in imum maturity or notice requirement is two business days, and the m in imum transaction amount is US$100,000. Funds raised by an IBF may be used only to extend credit to foreign residents (including foreign offices of domestic banks), to other IBFs, or to the entity establishing the IBF. Credit may be extended to nonbank foreign residents only if the proceeds are used to finance operations of the borrower or its affiliates outside the United States. Advances from an IBF to its establishing entity in the United States are subject to Eurocurrency requirements in the same manner as advances to the establishing entity from the en t i ty 's foreign offices. A number of individual states (but not the Federal Government) have granted favorable tax treatment under state or local law to IBF operations. In addition, federal legislation was enacted to exempt deposits at IBFs from Federal Deposit Insur- ance Corporation insurance coverage and assessments.

Gold may be freely imported except from the countries mentioned above and except counterfeit gold coins. U .S. gold coins are legal tender at their face value. Commercial imports of gold jewelry are free of quantitative restriction but are subject to import duty at a rate of approximately 12 percent. There is no du ty on gold ore, bullion, or coin. All forms of gold must be declared at the point of entry into the United States. Changes During 1984 Imports and Import Payments March 30. As a result of the 1983 Annual Product Review, import items totaling US$10.7 billion were excluded from the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) under the competitive need provisions of the pro- gram, while an additional list amounting to US$1.2 bil- lion of imports was excluded from the program under the product graduation policy. (Preferential treatment under the GSP was applied to US$10.8 billion, or 4»/2 percent of U .S. merchandise imports in 1983.) April 1. Voluntary export restraints by Japan on passenger car exports to the United States were extended for a fourth year (April 1, 1984-March 31, 1985), with a 10 percent increase in the ceiling to 1.85 million units. May 9. The Commerce Department ruled that the countervailing du ty law could not be applied to imports from nonmarket-economy countries. June 12. The United States International Trade Com- mission (USITC) determined that imports of specified carbon steel products were injuring domestic producers. (The Commission recommended to the President on July 11, 1984 that import relief be granted to the domestic steel industry under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974, in the form of higher tariffs and quotas for five years—see also entry for September 18, below.) June 13. The USITC determined that knives, forks, spoons, and ladles, w i th stainless steel handles, classi- fied under items 650.08, 650.09, 650.10, 650.12, 650.38, 650.39, 650.40, 650.42, 650.54, and 650.55, and (if included in sets) item 651.75, of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS), were not being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious in ju ry, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing articles like or directly competitive w i th the imported articles. Accordingly, the USITC did not recommend to the President that relief be granted under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974. June 27. The USITC determined that black copper, blister copper, anode copper, and unwrought copper, other than alloyed, were being imported into the United ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury to the domestic industry produc- ing articles like or directly competitive with the imported articles. The USITC therefore recommended to the President that the domestic industry be granted tempo- rary import relief under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974, but the President subsequently rejected the recom- mendation on the ground that it would not be in the national interest. July 9. The USITC determined that certain types of nonrubber footwear were not being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious in jury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing articles like or directly competitive with the imported articles. The investigation was instituted following a petition by certain U .S. firms and labor organizations for import relief under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974. July 25. The USITC determined that increased im- ports of certain canned tuna fish were not a substantial cause of serious injury to the domestic industry. The ruling was in response to a complaint filed by the domestic industry earlier in the year under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974. August 3. The President lifted some of the economic sanctions against Poland; the suspension of the most- favored-nation tariff status for Poland continued to apply. August 3. With effect from September 7, 1984, clari- fied rules of origin were introduced for imports of textiles and textile products into the United States in order to prevent "circumvention or frustration of multila- teral and bilateral agreements" and to "facilitate efficient and equitable administration" of the U.S. Textile Import Program. These were published as "Customs Service Regulations on Textiles and Textile Products (49 Federal Register 31248, August 3, 1984)." Under the clarified rules, an article's country of origin was determined (1) when it was wholly the growth, product, or manufac- ture of the concerned country, foreign territory or insular possession, or (2) when it consisted in whole or in part of material originating from another country, but had been made into a new and different article of commerce in the second country through substantial manufacturing or processing. The specific (and nonexhaustive) list of manufacturing or processing activities which were not considered per se to confer origin included (a) simple combining or packaging, (b) joining together by sewing, looping, linking, or other means of attaching otherwise completed articles, (c) cutting or separating materials already marked for a purpose, and (d) processing such as dyeing, printing, shower-proofing, superwashing, or other finishing operations. To determine whether sub- stantial manufacturing or processing has occurred, a comparison would be made between the article before and after such manufacturing or processing. The criteria for such comparison would include the extent of mate- rial, labor, and other direct processing or manufacturing costs; the time, complexity, and skill or technology UNITED STATES involved in the manufacturing or processing operation; and the physical change of the article at each stage. Criteria to determine whether a new or different article had been made would include change in commercial identity, essential character, and commercial use; such information should be provided in a declaration accom- panying the relevant shipment, so that U.S. Customs could make a determination on origin. September 18. The Administration announced the new steel policy, based on four main elements: (1) reaffirma- tion of the U .S. commitment to an open world trading system and a determination that protectionist relief for the steel industry under Section 201 of the U .S. Trade Act of 1974, as recommended by the USITC was not in the national economic interest; (2) vigorous and com- prehensive action against unfair trade practices by steel exporting countries; (3) negotiated "surge control" ar- rangements with countries whose exports had increased rapidly, excessively, and unfa ir ly, to the detriment of the U .S. economy; and (4) a steel import stabilization framework in which comprehensive action against unfair trade practices could be expected to result in a moderate and stable import share of the U .S. steel market and provide the domestic industry time to undertake adjust- ment, modernization, and strengthening of its competi- tive position. The specific actions under the new steel policy were based on the conviction that "unfair" trade practices were the preponderant source of the injury to the domestic steel industry. The actions included, inter alia, negotiation of bilateral arrangements with certain foreign suppliers, consultations with trading partners to eliminate trade-distorting practices, monitoring of efforts by the U .S. steel industry to adjust and modernize, and examination of domestic tax, regulatory, and other policies hindering such efforts. The Administration expected that implementation of the new steel policy would result in an import penetration ratio of approx- imately 18]/2 percent, excluding semifinished steel (see entry for December 19, below). October 30. The President signed into law the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 (hereinafter referred to as "the Act"), which was passed by the U .S. Congress on October 10, 1984. Title I of the Act provided amend- ments to tariff schedules, including 17 permanent and 53 temporary changes in tariff treatment. Title II contained a number of customs and miscellaneous provisions. Title III provided the President with authority to negoti- ate reductions in international barriers to trade in services and high-technology products as well as foreign invest- ment. The Act clarified the President's authority to retaliate against discriminatory foreign practices that affect U.S. trade in services, and expanded his authority to act against unfair foreign practices in the area of direct investment. Title IV provided the President with authority to negotiate bilateral trade agreements aimed at harmoniz- ing, reducing, or eliminating tariff and nontariff barriers; specific authority was granted for such negotiations with Israel and Canada. Requests for authority to negotiate 513 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution UNITED STATES with other countries would have to be approved by the Finance Committee of the Senate and the Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives; and any trade agreement negotiated under this authority would be subject to congressional approval. Title V renewed the GSP for eight and a half years, from January 3, 1985 to July 4, 1993, and specified that several additional factors be taken into account by the President in determining a country's eligibility for GSP benefits, including the patent, trademark, and copyright protection offered by a country to foreign nationals, the extent to which a country had taken steps to reduce trade- distorting investment barriers and barriers to trade in services, and the extent to which a country was accord- ing or taking steps to accord internationally recognized workers' rights to its labor force. Broader authority was provided to the President to increase or reduce the duty- free treatment of eligible countries. The Act also provided for the gradual phasing out of benefits over a two-year period when a country's annual gross national product (GNP) per capita reached US$8,500, indexed by 50 percent of the annual change in U.S. GNP. If, after any general product review, the President determined that a country had demonstrated a sufficient degree of competitiveness in a particular article, the competitive need limits on that article would be reduced from US$57 million (or 50 percent of GSP imports in that particular product) to US$25 million (25 percent). In addition, Hungary was deleted from the existing statu- tory list of countries excluded from GSP benefits, and the statutory list of products excluded from GSP treat- ment was broadened to cover the leather-related products sector, which includes footwear, handbags, luggage, work gloves, leather wearing apparel, and flat goods. Title VI dealt with trade law reform and provided amendments to the countervailing duty and antidumping trade laws. The major changes included the following provisions: (a) industries would be eligible for counter- vailing duty protection in cases where imports were manufactured from subsidized materials or parts (re- ferred to as "upstream subsidies"); (b) antidumping and countervailing duty laws were extended to cover sales that were "likely" to take place where actual injury was imminent, in contrast to previous laws which, in general, applied only to sales that had already taken place; (c) the definition of the domestic wine industry for purposes of filing antidumping and countervailing duty complaints was modified for a two-year period to include growers of wine grapes; (d) in determining material injury in cases involving dumping or subsidies, the USITC was required to assess the cumulative impact of imports of similar products from all countries under investigation, a provision designed to handle cases in which imports from individual countries account for only a small portion of total import penetration but could contribute to material injury to domestic industry when combined with similar imports from other countries under investigation; and (e) guidance was provided to the USITC in its investigation of "substantial injury" to domestic industry 514 by imports in escape clause cases. The USITC was instructed not to consider any one factor as overriding in determining whether to recommend import curbs; in particular, profitability of the domestic industry was not to be taken as precluding a finding of injury by imports. As for Title VII, it granted authorization for appropria- tion to customs and trade agencies. Under Title VIII, the President was given authority to enforce bilateral ar- rangements with foreign steel suppliers. The authority was granted for a maximum period of five years, renewable annually, on condition that the domestic steel industry reinvested profits in plant modernization and worker retraining. It was the "sense of the Congress" that implementation of the steel policy would result in a market share for steel imports in the 17-20 percent range. It was added that if the policy did not produce satisfactory results within a reasonable period, Congress would consider further legislative action. Title IX of the Act, relating to trade in wine, required the Office of the U .S. Trade Representative to identify tariff and nontariff barriers to U .S. wine exports and to consult with other countries with a view to reducing such barriers. It also empowered the President to retaliate against unfair foreign practices in wine. November 14. The Customs Service issued a directive to its ports to permit for 120 days exceptions to the country-of-origin marking requirements for imports of pipes and tubes contained in the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984. During the transition period, guidelines would be formulated to implement the marking requirements. November 29. Imports of steel pipes and tubes from the European Community (EC) were banned until De- cember 31, 1984. The action was taken in response to the increase in such imports beyond the level agreed in the understanding reached between the United States and the EC in 1982. December 14. The United States notified the Director- General of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) of its decision to withdraw from the Interna- tional Dairy Arrangement within 60 days. December 19. The Administration announced that, in accordance with the new steel policy, bilateral agree- ments on steel imports into the United States, covering a period of five years and restricting shares in the U .S. market to specified proportions, had been negoti- ated with seven countries: Australia (0.18 percent), Brazil (0.8 percent), Japan (5.8 percent), the Republic of Korea (1.9 percent), Mexico (0.3 percent), South Africa (0.42 percent), and Spain (0.67 percent). Imports of steel from other countries would be monitored, and the bilateral agreement on carbon steel imports from the EC negotiated in 1982 would continue to be operative. Negotiations with the EC on the latter's exports of pipes and tubes to the United States were to be continued. Existing antidumping and countervailing duty orders on specified steel imports from the countries with which bilateral agreements had been reached would be re- voked. At the same time, U .S. steel firms filed 28 anti- dumping and countervailing duty petitions against speci- ©International Monetary Fund.

Exports and Export Proceeds January 24. The United States and Japan agreed to extend the bilateral agreement on procurement of U .S .- made products and equipment by the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation of Japan for another period of three years. (The previous agreement had expired at the end of December 1983.) March 30. Licensing requirements were imposed, under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, on export and re-export of certain commodities to all destinations. The changes resulted from a review of strategic controls maintained by the United States and certain allied countries through the Coordinating Com- mittee. Licensing requirements were also imposed on the shipment of certain technical data to all destinations other than Canada. April 26. The Commerce Department abolished export controls for measuring instruments equipped with micro- processors, except for certain destinations (Cuba, Demo- cratic Kampuchea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, and Viet Nam). August 6. The Office of the U .S. Trade Representative announced that bilateral consultations with Taiwant had resulted in a decision by the latter to cut tariffs on 59 export items (including wood products, semiprocessed leather goods, chocolate confectionery, and selected agricultural goods) of interest to the United States. August 14. The United States and Japan entered into a four-year bilateral agreement under which Japan under- took to improve market access for U .S. exports of beef and citrus to Japan. September 11. The President announced that U .S. far- mers could ship additional grain to the U .S .S .R. in the second year of the five-year (1983-88) grain agreement between the two countries. September 11. The Commerce Department amended rules governing exports of high-technology goods to the U .S .S .R. The new rules increase reliance on "self- policing" by U .S. companies on such exports and establish an extensive prelicense review process. September 28. The Commerce Department expanded export controls applying to the Islamic Republic of Iran to include all aircraft, helicopters, and related parts and components.

Congress passed the Tax Reform tSee Explanatory Note on Coverage of Part Two, page 54. UNITED STATES Act of 1984, which included a provision to repeal the 30 percent withholding tax on interest paid to foreign investors in U .S. securities. Also, legislation governing Domestic International Sales Corporations (DISCs) was effectively replaced by new legislation, under which a U .S. exporter could obtain tax relief by establishing a Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) which would be re- quired to maintain an office overseas and practice arms- length pricing with its parent company. A portion of the foreign trade income earned from activities outside the United States would be exempt from U .S. taxation, rather than being eligible for tax deferral, as under the DISC program. Under the legislation, approximately US$24 billion of export income, earned in prior years, on which taxes had already been deferred under the DISC program, would not be subject to taxation. July 25. The U .S. Export-Import Bank guaranteed an export financing facility amounting to US$1.5 billion made available by U .S. banks for Brazil. July 28. A U.S.-Mozambique bilateral agreement was signed, activating Overseas Private Investment Corpora- tion programs in Mozambique. August 17. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) introduced temporary regulations to allow U .S. corpora- tions to issue bearer bonds to foreigners and to allow issuance of other U.S.-registered bonds to foreigners with some protection of identity. The regulations imple- mented the repeal of the 30 percent withholding tax on U.S.-source interest payments to foreigners and amended backup withholding tax rules. In a separate set of temporary regulations, the IRS amended 1983 rules that included guidelines for U .S. firms to ensure that their bearer obligations were not purchased by U .S. citizens. These amended rules provided, among other things, that the interest payments for the bonds be made outside the United States, and that, generally, the corporate bearer bonds would be sold and delivered outside the United States. The regulations put into effect plans announced by the Treasury on August 16, 1984 to allow corporations to take advantage of the withholding tax repeal by issuing bearer bonds targeted for foreign purchase. The Treasury would sell a special registered government bond designed to attract foreign investors by nondisclosure of the beneficial owners of the obligations. Financial institutions buy ing the targeted treasury bonds on behalf of an individual would have to certify to the United States that such a person was not a U .S. citizen or resident, but the identity of the beneficial owner of the new bonds would not have to be revealed. Under the new regulations, the IRS waived, for purposes of the new treasury obligations, certain requirements binding the sale or resale of corporate securities outside the United States, as long as the treasury obligations were offered for sale through a public auction. October 5. The IRS issued temporary regulations (T.D. 7983) giving guidance on electing status as a Foreign Sales Corporation. The rules, which replaced provisions relating to DISCs, implemented provisions of 515 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution UNITED STATES the Tax Reform Act of 1984 and were effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 1984. Under the new provisions, an FSC had to be a foreign corporation, and a portion of its income attributable to export profits but not export investment income is given tax exemp- tion. The rules stated that a DISC'S 1984 tax year would be deemed to terminate on December 31, 1984, and that the termination would be treated as a revocation of the DISC'S election. Thus, even if the DISC decided to continue as an interest-charge DISC, a new election would be needed. If the DISC'S termination resulted in a short taxable year, the gross export receipts for the current taxable year would have to be annualized for purposes of computing deemed distributions, under the temporary rules. Generally, all corporations qualifying as DISCs on December 31, 1984 were permitted to treat their ac- cumulated DISC income as previously taxed income for purposes of making tax-free distributions. As an FSC had to adopt the same taxable year as its principal shareholder, the temporary rules allowed taxpayers to make an election for tax years beginning after Decem- ber 31, 1984, and to conform the tax year to that of the principal shareholder. December 7. The IRS issued temporary regulations (T.D. 7993 and T.D. 7994) specifying the rules for establishing and operating Foreign Sales Corporations. The rules set out the foreign economic processes and foreign management requirements for FSCs, as well as the requirements to be met for companies to be consid- ered FSCs, including the definition of key items (such as investment income and carrying charges) that were not excluded from taxation. It was clarified that FSCs could be established in U.S. possessions, in countries that had tax information exchange agreements with the United States as part of the Caribbean Basin Initiative, and in 23 tax treaty partners specified by the Treasury Department as being qualified to host FSCs. 516 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution URUGUAY (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Uruguay is the Uruguayan New Peso. Until October 1978 Uruguay maintained a dual exchange market, the commercial market and the financial market, but the two markets were unified de facto in October 1978 when the Central Bank announced that it stood ready to buy and sell any amount of exchange at rates to be adjusted in variable amounts at frequent intervals. With effect from November 28, 1979 the commercial and financial markets were unified de jure. On Decem- ber 26, 1978 the Government announced that the new peso would be depreciated each month according to a preannounced peso-U.S. dollar relationship for a number of months. This preannounced exchange rate system was replaced on November 26, 1982 by a floating exchange rate system. Buying and selling interbank rates for the U .S. dollar, the intervention currency, on December 31, 1984, were NUr$74.50 and NUr$74.75, respectively, per US$1. Rates for other currencies are based on U .S. dollar rates in exchange markets abroad. For transactions settled in Uruguayan new pesos, a tax of 1 percent is levied on sales of foreign exchange in both the spot and forward exchange markets. Export proceeds are not required to be surrendered to the Central Bank. There are no limits on the amount of foreign exchange that the Central Bank may sell to or buy from the Bank of the Republic, the Mortgage Bank, commercial banks, banking and exchange houses, and savings and loan cooperatives. Uruguay formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from May 2, 1980. Administration of Control Exchange transactions are carried out through autho- rized banks, banking houses, savings and loan coopera- tives, and the Bank of the Republic. Any person or firm may conduct exchange transactions in the market. Exchange houses must be authorized by the Central Bank. Prescription of Currency Payments between Uruguay and the countries with which Uruguay has concluded reciprocal credit agree- ments may be made through accounts maintained with each other by the central banks, within the framework of the multilateral clearing system of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA); these countries are Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, and Venezuela. There are separate arrangements for trade in specified goods with Argentina and Brazil. All settlements are made in U .S. dollars or other convertible currencies. Imports and Import Payments All imports are subject to registration before the goods are shipped. The registrations are generally valid for 180 days, within which period goods must be cleared through customs. Most imports are subject to import surcharges. The surcharge rates are 10, 15, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50 percent and are payable to the Bank of the Republic at the time of registration. The Bank of the Republic also collects consular charges. Full or partial exemption from these surcharges is granted for imports from member countries of the LAI A, for imports of agricultural inputs, for imports by the public sector, for imports of capital goods, and for imports under the temporary admission scheme. Most imports are subject to a customs tariff (impuesto aduanero unico, IMADUNI) and a service charge (tasa de movilizacion de bultos, TMB), collected by the Customs Office. Tariff rates vary between 0 percent and 15 per- cent. The service charge is 1 percent of the c . i .f. import price for most imports. There are exemptions to the IMADUNI and the TMB. Most imports are subject to a 4 percent consular charge payable in new pesos and calculated on the f .o .b. value. Some products have officially assessed prices (precio de referenda or precio minimo de exportation) ex- pressed in U .S. dollars; in these cases, the import surcharge, customs tariff (IMADUNI) and service charge (TMB) are calculated either on the precio de referenda (or precio minimo de exportation) or on the actual c . i . f. value, whichever is higher, and in all other cases, on the latter. Payments for Invisibles There are no limitations on the export of foreign or domestic bank notes. Exports and Export Proceeds Foreign exchange proceeds from exports must be sold to the banks not later than 36 months after the expiration date of shipping documents. Exporters of nontraditional exports are eligible for rebates in respect of indirect taxes paid during the production process; such rebates, wh ich replaced the system of tax credit certificates with effect from January 1, 1983, averaged 6.2 percent of the f .o .b. value of nontraditional exports during 1983. Export of cattle on the hoof requires authorization from the Ministry of Agriculture. Exports of specified minerals (including iron, copper, zinc, a lum inum, and nickel) are prohibited. Traditional exports, such as beef, raw wool, and hides, are subject to an export tax at the rate of 5 percent. Proceeds from Invisibles There are no surrender requirements on the proceeds from invisibles, and there are no limitations on the import of foreign or domestic bank notes. 517 ©International Monetary Fund.

As a transitional arrangement, the Banque Indosuez Vanua tu, which is at present the Government's main depository, quotes daily the rates of the vatu against 11 currencies2 on the basis of their respective values in terms of the SDR. In its purchases and sales of vatu, the Banque Indosuez Vanuatu applies a margin of up to 1 percent over the international commercial buy ing and selling rates for the respective currencies in terms of the SDR. The overall size of the spread in the local market therefore reflects differences between buying and selling rates for foreign currencies in the international market and the Banque Indosuez Vanua tu 's margin of 1 percent. On December 29, 1984 the fixing buy ing and selling rates for the vatu (for telegraphic transfers) were VT 101.43 per US$1 and VT 103.65 per US$1, respec- tively. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Vanuatu formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from December 1, 1982. Prescription of Currency There are no prescription of currency requirements. Nonresident Accounts No distinction is made between accounts of residents and nonresidents. Debits and credits to all accounts may be made freely. Imports and Import Payments With the exception of specified minor quan t i ta t ive restrictions, all items may be freely imported. Imports of arms, ammunition, narcotic drugs, seeds, uncooked meat, and live animals are restricted and subject to authorization. For the island of Efate, potato imports are seasonally prohibited, usually lasting for six months from September to February; in addition, imports of frozen whole chickens and chicken pieces (other than wings) are prohibited. Import duties are levied mainly on an ad valorem basis (c . i .f .) on most imports. The customs import tariff is structured to charge duties and service taxes at importa- ^n April 1, 1985 the rate was changed to VT 110 = SDR 1, representing a devaluation of 8.5 percent. 2Australian dollar, French franc, CFP franc, Fiji dollar, deutsche mark, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen, New Zealand dollar, pound sterling, Singapore dollar, and U .S. dollar. tion.

Goods that are attractive to tourists, such as photographic equipment, watches, audio equ ipmen t, fu rs, sporting goods, e tc ., are taxed at the rate of 12 per- cent. Tobacco, wines, and spirits are subject to both specific and ad valorem duties as well as a service tax rate of 20 percent in preparation for a special duty-free shopping scheme. Imports of the central and local governments are exempted from import du t ies and the customs service tax. Payments for Invisibles There are no restrictions on payments for invisibles. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange proceeds from surrendered. invisibles need not be Exports and Export Proceeds With a few exceptions, no restrictions are applied on exports. Exports of trochus, green snails, beches de mer, and crustaceans3 are subject to authorization by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry. Copra and cocoa exports are channeled through the Vanua tu Commodities Marketing Board (VCMB), and exports of coffee are subject to authorization from the VCMB. Artifacts that are five years old or more are subject to authorization from the Cultural Centre. Most exports are subject to export duties, ma in ly on an ad valorem basis ( f .o .b . ); specific duties are levied on some minor exports, including scrap metal and timber. Export duties on copra are on a sliding-scale bas is, that is, higher rates for higher un it values. There are no surrender requirements for export proceeds.

Not for Redistribution VENEZUELA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Venezuela is the Venezuelan Bolivar. Venezuela maintains a four-tier exchange rate system under which three of the exchange rates are pegged to the U .S. dollar and the fourth is a fluctuating rate. In the first market, the Central Bank sells foreign exchange to the public in eligible cases at the rate of Bs 4.30 = US$1. The Central Bank may also sell foreign exchange at Bs 4.2925 = US$1 to banks, which may in turn sell to their customers at a rate of Bs 4.30 = US$1. Eligible payments at this preferential rate include those for (a) imports (including related freight and insurance) of foodstuffs and medicines defined as essential by the Government; (b) interest on private external debt authorized by the Differential Exchange System Office (RECADI) which fell due before December 31, 1983; (c) interest on foreign debt of public sector entities not directly serviced by the Central Government and which fell due before December 31, 1983; (d) amortization of foreign debt of public sector entities not directly serviced by the Central Government; (e) remittances abroad to students registered as such at RECADI as of February 24, 1984, up to specified monthly limits; and (f) amortiza- tion of authorized and registered private debt (defined as net liability position) under US$250,000, or, if higher, when rescheduled over seven years, with two years grace; in the case of payments for "essential" imports and student remittances, access to this market is sched- uled to be discontinued after December 31, 1985. In the second market, the Central Bank buys foreign exchange at the rate of Bs 5.9925 = US$1 from the national petroleum and iron ore companies, and sells foreign exchange to these companies at the rate of Bs 6.00 = US$1 for all their current and capital transactions. In the third market, the Central Bank buys foreign exchange at the rate of Bs 7.4925 = US$1 from the Venezuelan Investment Fund and from public entities which have obtained foreign exchange for reasons other than exports of goods and services; it sells foreign exchange in the same market to the public at the rate of Bs 7.50 = US$1, and to banks at the rate of Bs 7.4925 = US$1, when the banks act as inter- mediaries for the purpose of: (a) interest payments on external public and private sector debt registered at RECADI and falling due after December 31, 1983; (b) imports of goods and services other than "essential" foodstuffs and medicines (including related freight and insurance), for which the sale of foreign exchange has been authorized by RECADI; (c) public sector current payments abroad and payments related to international commitments of the Government of Venezuela; (d) in- terest and amortization payments on external debt con- tracted or serviced by the Central Government; (e) out- ward remittances to students receiving study grants; and (f) foreign exchange purchases by the Venezuelan 520 Investment Fund. All other transactions take place through the free market at a freely f luc tua t ing rate, except that, in the case of exports of goods and services containing imported inputs, foreign exchange equivalent to 50 percent of value of the portion of the foreign inputs in the f .o .b. value of the exported goods and services purchased at Bs 7.50 = US$1 should be sold to the Central Bank at the rate of Bs 7.50 = US$1. The Central Bank may buy and sell foreign exchange at the fluctuat- ing rate market which operates through financial inter- mediaries. The banks and exchange houses in this market may establish different exchange rates according to the instrument being transacted, but the spread between buy ing and selling rates for the same instrument may not exceed Bs 0.05 per US$1 in the case of banks and Bs 0.15 in the case of exchange houses. On December 31, 1984 the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar at the foreign exchange houses were Bs 12.65 = US$1 a n dBs 12.80 = US$1, respectively. Buying and selling rates for other officially quoted currencies1 are based, for each market, on the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar in major markets abroad. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. In the case of interbank transfers, domestic banks may charge only the cost of the transfer, including commission and other charges by the foreign banks. Venezuela formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4, of the Fund Agreement, on July 1, 1976. Administration of Control Foreign exchange policies are established by the Ministry of Finance, with the advice of the Differential Exchange System Advisory Committee. The committee is chaired by the Minister of Finance and includes the Minister of Development, the Minister of Agriculture and Livestock, the Minister of the Central Coordination and Planning Office, the President of the Central Bank of Venezuela, and the President of the Venezuelan Invest- ment Fund. The exchange control system is administered by the Central Bank and the RECADI, the head of which serves as secretary to the Differential Exchange System Advisory Committee. Import and export licenses are generally issued by the Ministry of Development or the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, depending on the commodity. Import quotas and prohibitions within the multiple exchange rate system are established by the Ministry of Finance. The Superintendency of Foreign Investments (SIEX) exercises supervision over foreign investment in Venezuela, over contracts for the importa- tion of foreign technology and the use of foreign patents and trademarks, and over borrowing abroad.

Imports and Import Payments Imports from South Africa are prohibited. In addition, importation of certain goods is either prohibited or reserved for the Government; these include iron and steel products, luxury food, apparel, and specified consumer durables. Certain other commodities also require import licenses. For protective purposes, quantitative restric- tions are maintained on some of these items, irrespective of origin, except in the case of Andean Pact and LAI A member countries. Licenses are valid for all countries except South Africa. Import licenses for some goods are issued on evidence that the importer has purchased domestic products equal to a prescribed percentage of the quantity to be imported. Payments for imports of foodstuffs and medicines listed by the Government as "essential" imports may be made at the preferential rate of Bs 4.30 = US$1.2 Payments for imports by the national petroleum and iron ore companies may be made at the rate of Bs 6.00 = US$1. All other goods which are not prohibited, re- served for the public sector, or subject to special regimes may be imported at the rate of Bs 7.50 = US$1 when authorized by RECADI, or at the free market rate. Imports into the free port of Margarita Island and those of a small list of products (alcoholic beverages) must be made at the free market rate. To have access to foreign exchange from the Central Bank for payment of imports, an importer must obtain an import license (Conformidad de Importation) from RECADI before the date of shipment of the goods; the license has a validity of 180 days, and may be renewed for up to 30 additional days only in specified cases. At the time the above license is granted, RECADI also issues an exchange authorization license (Autorizacion para la Obtencion de Divisas). RECADI is authorized to impose advance import deposits in domes- tic currency of up to 100 percent of the value of the foreign exchange application. Imports for the government sector are controlled by a commission established by Decree No. 2166 (May 26, 1977) that has the power of prior authorization over all public sector imports. This authorization is needed in order to obtain letters of credit, exemption from import duties, and, if necessary, financing. By Decree No. 2664 (April 28, 1978), the Foreign Trade Institute was ap- pointed as the technical coordinator of the commission. In accordance with the timetable issued by the Andean Pact Commission, contained in the Protocol of Lima, VENEZUELA Venezuela adopted the m in imum external tariff in 1978 (Decree No. 2772 of August 3, 1978). It has also agreed, in principle, to harmonize external tariffs and eliminate all import duties on trade w i th in the Andean subregion by December 31, 1983, in the prescribed annual stages. Payments for Invisibles Payments for the following categories of invisibles are allowed to be made through the preferential rate of Bs 4.30 = US$1: (a) freight and insurance associated with imports made at this rate; (b) interest payments on external debt of public entities not serviced by the Central Government and on external private debt autho- rized by RECADI falling due before December 31, 1983; and (c) expenses of Venezuelan students abroad regis- tered with RECADI as of February 24, 1984, up to specified monthly limits.3 Invisible payments by the national petroleum and iron ore companies are made at the rate of Bs 6.00 = US$1.

Other payments for invisibles can be made through the free market, without limit. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to South Africa are prohibited. Exports of certain furs and hides, scrap metal, and a few other commodities are prohibited. Licenses are required for the export of commodities subject to price controls or deemed to be in short supply domestically; for most commodities such licenses are issued by the Ministry of Development, but those for coffee, cacao, rice, and sugar are granted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock. The export of precious stones and gold requires an export license issued by the Ministry of Finance. In the case of private exporters, the authoriza- tion to export is contingent on agreement to sell export proceeds to authorized banks within 30 days of shipment in the case of cash exports, and within 10 days of the due payment date in the case of exports on credit. Export earnings by companies active in the extraction and marketing of hydrocarbons and the mining of iron ore must be surrendered to the Central Bank at the rate of Bs 5.9925 = US$1. All other export earnings may be sold in the freely fluctuating market; when sold to the Central Bank, the applicable exchange rate is the rate us'ed by the Central Bank for its operations in the free market.

Not for Redistribution VENEZUELA foreign exchange equivalent to one half of the imported component of the f .o .b. value of exports must be sold to the Central Bank at the rate of Bs 7.50 = US$1. Exporters of coffee and cacao may receive an export subsidy calculated to prevent the f .o .b. bolivar prices of these products in Venezuelan ports from falling below specified m in imum amounts regardless of external prices. In principle, the benefit of these arrangements may be extended to firms processing domestic coffee or cacao for export. The promotion of nontraditional exports in Venezuela takes two basic forms: first, the Export Financing Fund, established in September 1973, provides direct credit facilities at interest rates below those charged by other lenders, and it also lends in conjunction with commercial banks; second, the Export Incentive Law (September 1973) assists nontraditional exports through fiscal subsidies in the form of tax credit certificates. Under the Export Incentive Law, negotiable tax credit certificates with a two-year maturity are granted to exporters of nontraditional products ( i .e ., exports other than petroleum, iron ore, coffee, and cacao) that have a domestic value added greater than 30 percent. These certificates can be held to maturity and used to meet government tax liabilities, or can be traded in the local market at a discount. For the purpose of calculating the amount of the export subsidy, the domestic currency equivalent of the export value is calculated at the rate of Bs 7.50 = US$1. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles are freely dispos- able, except for those of the Venezuelan Investment Fund, the national and local governments (which must be surrendered at the rate of Bs 7.4925 = US$1), and petroleum and iron ore companies (which must be surrendered at Bs 6.00 = US$1). Travelers may freely import domestic and foreign currency, with the excep- tion that the Currency Law prohibits the importation for commercial purposes of foreign coin other than gold coin. Capital The national and local governments, autonomous agencies, and state enterprises (other than petroleum and iron ore companies) are required to surrender to the Central Bank at the rate of Bs 7.4925 = US$1 all exchange proceeds from foreign borrowing; principal repayments on external debt of public sector entities are effected at the rate of Bs 4.30 = US$1, while principal repayments on the external debt contracted or serviced by the Central Government are effected at the rate of Bs 7.50 = US$1. Foreign exchange receipts from capital transactions by the national petroleum and iron ore companies are required to be surrendered to the Central Bank at the rate of Bs 5.9925 = US$1, and payments on capital transactions by these companies are effected at the rate of Bs 6.00 = US$1. All foreign exchange brought into Venezuela by the Venezuelan 522 Investment Fund is subject to conversion at the rate of Bs 7.4925 = US$1. Principal repayments on external private sector debt registered with RECADI can also be effected at the rate of Bs 4.30 = US$1 as long as the debt is rescheduled over seven years with two years of grace or if the amount is less than US$250,000. Eligible debt for this purpose is defined as the net liability position in foreign exchange as of February 18, 1983 of (1) banking, financial, and insurance companies, and (2) nonfinancial enterprises of mixed or Venezuelan ownership in the areas of manufacturing (if the debt was contracted for the acquisition of capital goods for use within the country), transportation and public services (if the debt was for the acquisition of equipment), and construction (if the debt was incurred for public sector works or works guaranteed by the public sector for social housing projects). All other inward and outward capital transfers for or by residents are permitted without restriction in the freely fluctuating exchange market. However, brokerage activity in Venezuela in shares or units of foreign investment trusts or mutual funds is prohibited. Foreign capital imported for investment purposes and all foreign credits must be registered with SIEX. Foreign direct investment is governed by Andean Pact regulations. Natural gas and iron mining operations are reserved for the State, and foreign investment in the petroleum sector is prohibited. The Central Bank regu- lates bank credit to nonresidents and companies whose capital is more than 50 percent owned by physical persons or companies that are resident or domiciled abroad. The General Banking Law authorizes the Gov- ernment to regulate bank credit to companies whose capital is more than 40 percent owned by nonresident or foreign physical persons or companies. This law also regulates the activities of foreign banks operating in Venezuela. Interest earnings on loans extended by foreign financial institutions are exempt from income tax. Gold Venezuelan gold coins are legal tender but do not circulate. Residents may hold, acquire, and sell gold coins in Venezuela for numismatic and investment purposes. The Central Bank does not deal in gold with the public, but gold coin, medallions, and bars are freely negotiated among authorized importers and exchange houses and the public. Commercial banks may freely negotiate gold coin among themselves and with other residents but do not normally deal in gold with the public. Imports and exports of monetary gold are reserved for the Central Bank, as is the import of gold coins that are legal tender in Venezuela. Imports and exports of nonmonetary gold (other than jewelry for personal use) and of gold coins eligible as legal tender in Venezuela or abroad are subject to prior authorization by the Central Bank. In addition, imports require licenses from the Ministry of Finance and in certain cases also from the Ministry of Development, while exports are licensed by the Ministry of Finance only. The ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution law prescribes a license for all imports and exports of gold by anyone not registered at the Ministry of Development as an industrial user. Imports of gold are subject to duty at varying rates. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement February 24. In a modification of the existing three- tier exchange system, a fourth exchange rate equivalent to Bs 7.50 = US$1 was introduced, and exchange settlement for most transactions was shifted from the rate of Bs 4.30 = US$1 to the rates of Bs 6.00 and Bs 7.50 per US$1. Foreign exchange transactions of national petroleum and iron ore companies, which were prev- iously effected at the rates of Bs 4.2925 = US$1 (buying) and Bs 4.30 = US$1 (selling), became subject to the rates Bs 5.9925 and Bs 6.00 per US$1, respec- tively. In addition, foreign exchange inflows by the Venezuelan Investment Fund and other public sector entities, other than export earnings of autonomous institutions, which had hitherto been converted at the rate of Bs 4.2925 = US$1, were to be converted at the rate of Bs 7.4925 = US$1, and conversion of export proceeds of public entities other than petroleum and iron ore companies was shifted from the rate of Bs 6.00 = US$1 to the free market. Settlement of payments for permitted merchandise imports not classified as essential or subject to special regimes was also shifted from the rate of Bs 6.00 = US$1 to that of Bs 7.50 = US$1, and government payments abroad, as well as part of autho- rized student remittances and debt payments were moved from the rate of Bs 4.30 = US$1 to that of Bs 7.50 = US$1. Imports and Import Payments February 24. Within the newly established four-tier exchange rate system, access to the preferential rate of Bs 4.30 = US$1 was limited to a list of foodstuffs and medicines deemed by the Government as essential, and it was announced that access to this rate would be discontinued after December 31, 1985. Payments for imports by the national petroleum and iron ore compa- nies, previously effected at the rate of Bs 4.30 = US$1, would henceforth be effected at the rate of Bs 6.00 = US$1. Access for other imports to the rate of Bs 6.00 = US$1 was terminated; and all permitted imports not considered essential or not subject to special regimes were made eligible for the rate of Bs 7.50 = US$1. June 11. Some 200 import items were transferred from the list of "essential" imports to that of imports eligible for the Bs 7.50 = US$1 rate. (Additional such transfers continued to be made during the second half of 1984.) Payments for Invisibles February 24. As part of the regulations establishing a four-tier exchange rate system, eligibility for the prefer- ential rate of Bs 4.30 per US$1 was limited to the VENEZUELA fo l low ing invisible payments: (a) freight and insurance associated with imports effected at this rate; (b) interest payments on the external debt of pub l ic entities not serviced by the Central Government, as well as private external debt registered by RECADI and fa l l ing due before December 31, 1983; and (c) remittances abroad to students registered w i th RECADI as of February 24, 1984, up to specified monthly l im i ts; in cases (a) and (c) access to this rate would be discontinued after the end of 1985. Authorized invisible payments by petroleum and iron ore companies, previously effected at the rate of Bs 4.30 = US$1, were to be made at the rate of Bs 6.00 .= US$1. In addition, the following invisible payments were made eligible for the rate of Bs 7.50 per US$1: (a) freight and insurance costs associated with imports effected at the same rate; (b) public sector current payments abroad; (c) remittances abroad to students under study grants; (d) interest on the external debt of the Central Govern- ment or serviced by the Central Government; and (e) in- terest on the registered external debt of the private sector and the external debt of public entities not serviced by the Central Government, falling due after December 31, 1983, April 27. Authorization was granted for interest payments at the preferential exchange rate (Bs 4.30 and Bs 7.50 per US$1) on private external debt still in the process of registration with RECADI, provided that the applicant presented a bank guarantee for payment of the difference in the value of the debt as calculated using the free market exchange rate, which would have to be applied in the event of rejection of the debt for registration (Decree 96). November 22. A limit equivalent to LIBOR plus 1 !/4 percent was imposed by the Central Bank on interest payments at the preferential exchange rate in respect of private external debt that was either registered or in the process of registration. The l im i t, which could be changed once a year, would apply to interest payments accrued after May 22, 1984. Exports and Export' Proceeds February 24. As part of the regulations establishing a four-tier exchange rate system, export proceeds of the national petroleum and iron ore companies, which previously had been sold to the Central Bank at the rate of Bs 4.2925 = US$1, were to be sold to the Central Bank at the rate of Bs 5.9925 = US$1, while export proceeds of other public entities of state enterprises, which had been converted previously at the rate of Bs 6.00 = US$1, were shifted to the free market. In addition, authorization for the private sector to export became subject to agreement to sell such export proceeds to authorized banks w i th in 30 days of shipment in the case of cash exports, and w i th in 10 days of payment date in the case of exports on credit. For exports w i th imported components, an amount of foreign exchange equivalent to one half of the proportion of the imported component in the total f .o .b. value of export was 523 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution VENEZUELA required to be sold to the Central Bank at the rate of Bs 7.50 = US$1. Capital February 24. Within the newly established four-tier exchange rate system, the conversion exchange rate for capital receipts and payments of petroleum and iron ore companies was changed from Bs 4.30 to Bs 6.00 per US$1, while that for all exchange proceeds from official foreign borrowing and funds brought into Venezuela by the Venezuelan Investment Fund was modified from Bs 4.2925 to Bs 7.4925 per US$1. Principal repayments on external debt of public sector entities would continue to be effected at the rate of Bs 4.30 = US$1, but those on the external debt of the Central Government or serviced by the Central Government were to be effected at the rate of Bs 7.50 = US$1. In addition, principal repayments on external private sector debt registered by RECADI would continue to be effected at the rate of Bs 4.30 = US$1, provided that the debt was registered with RECADI and rescheduled over seven years w i th two years of grace, or if such debt was less than US$100,000. December 4. The l im it on registered private external debt not subject to seven-year rescheduling was raised from US$100,000 to US$250,000. Gold January 10. Imports and exports of nonmonetary gold (other than jewelry for personal use) and of gold coins eligible as legal tender in Venezuela or abroad were made subject to prior authorization by the Central Bank. 524 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution VIET NAM (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement On May 3, 1978 the North Vietnamese dong and the South Vietnamese dong were withdrawn from circu- lation and a new currency, the Vietnamese Dong, was introduced, with an official exchange rate of D 2.66358 = SDR 1, equivalent to D 2.17 = US$1. On December 31, 1984, the official exchange rate was D 10.356 = SDR 1. In practice, the official exchange rate between the dong and the U.S. dollar has been maintained within relatively narrow margins. Viet Nam began to participate in the transferable values system on January 1, 1981; the exchange rate for the transferable ruble (TR) has been fixed at D 16.235 = TR 1 since October 1, 1981. Exchange rates of the dong for certain foreign currencies are quoted by the State Bank of Viet Nam on the basis of the cross rates of these currencies against the U .S. dollar. Since October 1981, a premium rate of D 12 = US$1 has been applied to export proceeds of local corporations; receipts in convertible currencies from tourists are eligible for a fixed premium of 20 percent; and a preferential rate of D 20 = US$1 is applied to inward remittances from Vietnamese workers in the nonconvertible area. A preferential exchange rate of D 60 = US$1 is applied for inward remittances and transfers from the convertible currency area, replacing the premium of 30-^K) percent in effect since 1981. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the State Bank. Foreign trade is administered by the Ministry of Foreign Trade, which authorizes the foreign trade transactions carried out by specialized state import-export corpora- tions or, in certain cases, cooperatives or state enter- prises. Import and export licenses are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Trade; approval is given for imports in excess of the Plan on the merit of each application. Most foreign exchange transactions are effected by the Bank for Foreign Trade. Most of the foreign exchange transactions related to foreign technical assistance are monitored by the Aid Reception Commission, which is an agency directly attached to the Cabinet of the Prime Minister. Prescription of Currency Trade transactions with member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), Albania, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are settled either under the CMEA transferable ruble settlement system (Czechoslovakia, Cuba, Hungary, Mongolia, and the U .S .S .R .) or through individual bilateral clearing ac- counts. Nontrade transactions with countries with which Viet Nam has bilateral payments agreements{ take place at exchange rates specified in these agreements. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents are permitted to ma in ta in nonresident accounts either in foreign currencies or in dong. Nonresi- dents can freely reconvert into foreign currency and transfer abroad unused balances in Vietnamese currency that have been acquired against foreign currency. Imports and Exports An import plan and an export plan are drawn up annually on the basis of the overall annual plan and quotas agreed upon under bilateral trade arrangements. In principle, import and export transactions are carried out by about 20 central import-export corporations and 12 local corporations. Local corporations must obtain specific approval from the Ministry of Foreign Trade to import and export. Some of these corporations have their own producing units, while others contract with supply- ing enterprises. All payments for external trade transac- tions need the authorization of the State Bank and are made through the Bank for Foreign Trade. Export receipts are normally channeled through the Bank for Foreign Trade, and any other receipts from foreign trade have to be surrendered to the State Bank. Administrative procedures were changed in August 1982 when exportation of 25 items became the mono- poly of the central export-import corporations. All foreign exchange proceeds were required to accrue directly to the Central Government and the local trading companies in Ho Chi Minh City came under the supervision of a new state-owned organization (IMEXCO) that coordinates all foreign trading activity and arranges for related financing. Local corporations may procure and export these 25 exportable commodities only after the centrally set targets have been achieved. Other commodities can be exported by local corporations subject to approval from the Ministry of Foreign Trade. Local corporations may import only commodities on a list approved by the Ministry of Foreign Trade. As a general rule, items importable by these corporations are limited to those needed in their regions, and they may export only those commodities originating from their region. An export bonus system has been in operation since 1980 to provide additional incentives for export produc- tion. By fu lf i l l ing Plan targets, exporters earn a bonus of ' At the end of 1984 Viet Nam had bilateral payments agreements w i th eight countries that were not members of the IMF —Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Repub l ic, Mon- golia, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Poland, and the U .S .S .R ., and w i th six IMF members —Bangladesh, the People's Republic of China, the Lao People's Democratic Repub l ic, Ma l i, Romania, and the Syrian Arab Republic. 525 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution VIET NAM 2 percent to 10 percent of the value of planned exports, depending on the qua l i ty and kind of product; another bonus of 3-5 percent is earned on exports in excess of targets. State enterprises whose export earnings exceed Plan targets can freely import required inputs and certain consumer goods up to the value of such excess. Under an export earnings retention scheme, the regional governments are entitled to obtain from the State Bank at the official exchange rate 30 percent of the foreign exchange earnings from exports of their region and 90 percent of foreign exchange earnings from that part of the exports that exceeds their export quotas. As an export incentive, the regional governments guarantee to the export companies a premium rate of D 12 = US$1 for the conversion of their export proceeds. Additional incentives are provided for certain exporters in the form of a right to use for imports a portion of the net earnings (defined as export receipts less the cost of imported goods and interest cost of borrowed foreign exchange) ranging from 30 percent to 90 percent depending on the quality and type of product. Deposits in foreign currency are held at the Bank for Foreign Trade in the names of exporters, that is, the state-trading companies, or the regional trading companies, or the specialized (j°mt) state-private agencies. These deposits can be used to finance domestic purchases, in which case they are transferred to the name of the seller, and to finance certain nonluxury imports. State enterprises have three export plans (primary, secondary, and tertiary). Primary export plans are formulated by the Government against deliveries of key inputs by the Government; secondary plans are set by the Government but without sufficient supply of inputs (e.g., fuel) by the Government, thus leaving the task of procuring the needed inputs to the enterprises; tertiary plans are set freely by the producing units, which utilize discarded materials. For imports from the nonconvertible area, annual credits in foreign exchange are allocated to importers on the basis of actual production capacity; in principle, such credits cannot be carried over from one year to another. For imports from the convertible area, although a similar foreign exchange allocation system exists in principle, it is not in use, as decisions to allocate foreign exchange are taken by the Prime Minister's Cabinet on a case-by- case basis, upon recommendations from the State Plan- ning Commission, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and specified Vice-Premiers. For transactions under the local production plans, local authorities are authorized to decide on foreign exchange allocation, provided that the resources are derived from their export earnings. Payments for Invisibles All transactions in invisibles require individual authorization by the State Bank. Foreign exchange is made available upon authorization of the transaction. All travel abroad needs individual authorization, from the Prime Minister's Cabinet, and, at present, is limited to official business for which all foreign exchange expenses are covered. Students abroad in nonsocialist countries who had left the country before April 1975 may receive foreign exchange allocations as determined by the State Bank for each individual case. Receipts from transac- tions in invisibles have to be surrendered to the State Bank within seven days. The export and import of Vietnamese currency and of securities denominated in Vietnamese currency need the special permission of the State Bank. The circulation of foreign currency in the domestic market is prohibited. Legal holders of foreign exchange are authorized to buy foreign and local consumer goods in special government shops. Capital The Foreign Investment Law provides for three forms of foreign investment: (1) investment in the production of goods intended solely for export; (2) joint ventures between a foreign investor and a Vietnamese state economic organization; and (3) production-sharing part- nerships for the exploitation of natural resources. The share of foreign capital that is permitted ranges from 30 percent to 49 percent for joint ventures and up to 100 percent for enterprises specializing in production for export. There are guarantees of repatriation of pro- fits and of proper compensation in the event of nationalization. Gold The State Bank alone has the authority to purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad. Physical persons are permitted to own jewelry and artistic and cultural objects of gold for domestic and personal use. Changes During 1984 No significant changes occurred in the exchange and trade system. 526 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution WESTERN SAMOA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement1 The currency of Western Samoa is the Western Samoa Tala. Since July 6, 1979 the value of the tala in terms of the New Zealand dollar is determined by reference to a basket of currencies and to other factors that are considered important in determining that external value. Exchange rates for other currencies are established on the basis of their daily rates against the New Zealand dollar. There is an exchange levy of 1 percent on gross sales of foreign exchange, giving rise to spreads in excess of 2 percent in exchange transactions. Administration of Control Overall responsibility for the administration of ex- change control rests with the Treasury and the Central Bank of Samoa. The daily administration of exchange controls is handled by the Central Bank of Samoa, which may delegate part of its powers to authorized banks. In principle, all payments to nonresidents of Western Samoa require the approval of the Central Bank of Samoa; the Bank of Western Samoa and the Pacific Commercial Bank —the only authorized banks—are em- powered to approve certain payments up to any amount, and certain other payments up to specified amounts. Prescription of Currency There are no prescriptions as to the currencies in which payments to or from nonresidents of Western Samoa must be made or received. Nonresident Accounts No distinction is made between the accounts of residents and nonresidents of Western Samoa. Imports and Import Payments The import of a few commodities is prohibited for reasons of security or health. Other commodities may be imported from any source without restriction, with the exception of motor vehicles, capital equipment in excess of dutiable values of WS$ 10,000, and a few items for which there are domestically manufactured substitutes.2 Import transactions other than for petroleum products and exceeding US$10,000 in each case are required to be made under letters of credit. Special approval is required for imports of the latter group of commodities. 'On March 1, 1985, the Western Samoan authorities discontinued the fixed link between the Western Samoan tala and the New Zealand dollar, and introduced a system under which the exchange rate of the tala would be determined in terms of a peg to a basket of currencies of five countries with the largest shares in its foreign trade or constituting major sources of private inward transfers. In addition, the U .S. dollar replaced the New Zealand dollar as the intervention currency. 2Beer, cigarettes, timber, veneer, matches, and cigarette lighters. Payments for Invisibles Payments for certain invisibles may be approved by the authorized banks up to specified limits. Payments in excess of these limits, as well as payments for all other invisibles, require the prior approval of the Central Bank. Remittances for study abroad are normally autho- rized. Approval of the Central Bank of Samoa is required in respect of all transfers of local earnings from divi- dends, interest, and pensions of overseas residents. Residents and expatriates traveling overseas for private purposes are entitled to a foreign currency allowance equivalent to WS$100 a person a day, subject to a limit of WS$2,000 a person a year; in the case of travel for business purposes, the daily allowance is WS$200 within a limit of US$4,000 a trip. The Central Bank of Samoa grants supplementary allocations against evi- dence of genuine need. As part of their foreign currency allowance, resident travelers may take out foreign bank notes equivalent to WS$500 a person. Travelers may not take out any domestic currency. A 15 percent withhold- ing tax is levied on remittances of dividends at the source and interest payments on overseas loans. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports require export licenses issued by the Customs Department. Exports may be prohibited by the Director of Agriculture and the Produce Marketing Division on grounds of low quality, or by order of the Head of State to alleviate domestic shortages. Exports of cocoa are controlled by the Cocoa Board. An export levy of 7 percent is imposed on the f .o .b. value of cocoa.3 Export proceeds must be surrendered to the authorized banks within a reasonable time after shipment. Proceeds from Invisibles All foreign currencies earned by residents in perform- ing services for nonresidents must be surrendered to the authorized banks. Resident travelers must on return sell to the banks all unused foreign currency brought in. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount in foreign bank notes, but may not bring in any domestic bank notes. Capital All outward capital transfers by residents require the specific approval of the Central Bank of Samoa. Inward capital remittances do not normally require approval, but borrowing abroad by nonbank residents does require approval. The authorized banks approve transfers of gifts to relatives and dependents, either for special family occasions or by way of maintenance, up to WS$250 a year a person. Foreign investments in specified activities 3The export levy on cocoa is activated at a price of WS$800 a ton. 527 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution WESTERN SAMOA in Western Samoa are encouraged. The Enterprises Incentive Act provides for the granting of certain relief of income tax and business license fees to persons engaged in approved enterprises. Both the repatriation of capital and profit remittances on foreign capital are subject to approval by the Central Bank of Samoa; such approval is normally granted. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form. There are no restrictions on imports or exports of gold. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement May 7. The midpoint exchange rate of the Western Samoa tala against the New Zealand dollar was changed from WS$ 1.0600 = $NZ 1 to WS$ 1.1071 = $NZ 1, representing a depreciation of 4.25 percent. May 31.

Administration of Control May 1. The Central Bank of Samoa began operation. Imports and Import Payments July 1. The foreign exchange allocation system for private imports was abolished, except for motor vehi- cles, durable capital equipment valued in excess of WS$ 10,000, beer, cigarettes, timber, veneer, matches, and cigarette lighters, which would continue to require specific Central Bank permission prior to importation. In addition, all imports in excess of WS$10,000 other than those of petroleum products, were required to be made under letters of credit. Payments for Invisibles December 3. The foreign exchange allowance for foreign travel was modified from a daily limit of WS$50 for residents, within a yearly ceiling of WS$2,000 to (a) a daily limit of WS$100 (within an unchanged yearly ceiling) for private travel by residents and expatriates, and (b) a daily ceiling of WS$200 (within a yearly ceiling of WS$4,000) for business travel. In addition, the amount of foreign bank notes that resident travelers could take out as part of their overall travel allowance was set at the equivalent of WS$500. Capital December 3.

On December 31, 1984 the official buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were YRls 5.85 and YRls 5.87, respectively, per US$1. Buying and selling rates for certain other currencies1 are fixed daily by the Central Bank of Yemen on the basis of rates for the U.S. dollar in markets abroad. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control All imports require a license issued by the Ministry of Economy and Industry or the Ministry of Commerce and Supply. The Ministry of Economy and Industry issues licenses for raw materials, machinery, equipment and spare parts for industry, and the Ministry of Commerce and Supply issues import licenses for all other items. Transactions in invisibles are supervised by the Central Bank. All commercial banks and exchange dealers operate in foreign exchange. Prescription of Currency There are no prescription of currency requirements. Settlements may be made in any currency. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Israel are prohibited. Importation of certain items of used machinery for purposes of resale is also prohibited. All other imports require licenses and must be processed through local commercial banks. In addition, the importation of certain commodities requires the permission of certain government agencies. Insur- ance for all imports must be purchased locally. With specified exceptions, importers who hold an import license must obtain the necessary foreign exchange from local banks. Margin deposits are prescribed against letters of credit opened for imports at the rates of 20 per- cent for foodstuffs and fue l, 25 percent for raw mate- rials, and 40 percent for all other commodities. In addition to the applicable customs du ty, imports are subject to a defense tax of 5 percent, a statistical tax of 2 percent, and a tax of 1 percent for reconstruction related to earthquake damage. Imports shipped without licenses are subject to double customs duty. Payments for Invisibles Payments for current invisibles may be made freely.

Not for Redistribution PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen is the Yemeni Dinar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at YD 1 = US$2.89524. Buying and selling rates for the pound sterling are also officially quoted by the National Bank of Yemen (the sole commercial bank and authorized dealer), with daily quotations based on the buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar in markets abroad. On December 31, 1984 the National Bank of Yemen's buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were YD 0.343 and YD 0.350, respectively, per US$1. Rates for all other prescribed currencies are quoted weekly; additional adjustments are made when there are major changes in the market rates for these currencies in London and New York the previous day. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Administration of Control The administration of exchange control is carried out by the General Department for Exchange Control of the Bank of Yemen (the central bank) through the Foreign Exchange Committee, which has delegated certain pow- ers to the Director of Exchange Control, a member of that Committee. The Ministry of Trade and Supply issues import and export licenses; those for gold and other precious metals require the prior approval of the Director of Exchange Control. Exchange transactions must be carried out through the National Bank of Yemen. Other dealers in foreign exchange, who may deal only in traveler's checks and bank notes, are classified into ordinary money changers and secondary dealers. Ordi- nary money changers, whose principal business is to sell and purchase foreign exchange for their own account or for the account of the National Bank, are permitted to deal in specified currencies. Secondary dealers, such as hotels, travel bureaus, and retail stores selling tourist goods, are permitted to accept payment in foreign exchange only from their customers and are required to surrender the receipts in foreign exchange to the National Bank not later than the following business day. While the authorized bank and money changers are allowed to charge a commission for the purchase and sale of foreign exchange as specified by the Committee, secondary dealers may not do so. Except for payments for imports against letters of credit or documents, which may be approved by the authorized dealer, all payments for imports (including those of precious metals) require the prior approval of the Director of Exchange Control. Certain public cor- porations are engaged in foreign trade (see section on Imports and Import Payments, below). Prescription of Currency Exchange transactions must be carried out through the authorized dealer in accordance with prescription of currency regulations. All payments to Israel are pro- hibited. Export proceeds and certain receipts from invisibles must be received in convertible currencies and surrendered to the authorized dealer; proceeds from exports or re-exports to specified neighboring countries may be surrendered in the currencies of such countries. Payments for imports must be made in prescribed currencies. Nonresident Accounts External Accounts in Yemeni dinars may be credited with proceeds from convertible foreign currency trans- ferred from abroad, with bank interest payable on such accounts, and with balances from other External Ac- counts. Transfers from abroad must be in the form of bank drafts; the accounts may not be credited with payments in the form of foreign bank notes (unless they have been declared to the customs on entry), or with locally raised or locally earned funds (except in certain specified cases). External Accounts may be debited for any payments to residents, for transfers to other External Accounts, and for payments abroad in any convertible currency. Transfers abroad from External Accounts in Yemeni dinars require the prior approval of the Ex- change Control Department. The Foreign Exchange Committee may direct any payment to a nonresident to a Blocked Account. Except with the Committee's prior approval, Blocked Accounts may be debited only for purchases of specified securities. Yemeni nationals working abroad may establish non- resident accounts in foreign currencies; balances in these accounts earn interest and are convertible into foreign currency on demand. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Israel are prohibited. Imports of cars other than those needed for development projects are also prohibited. All imports require individual licenses. Goods originating in the Yemen Arab Republic are exempt from the licensing requirements. There is an annual import program. Importers may import certain goods with their own exchange; such imports require prior approval by the Ministry of Trade and Supply. Payments for imports on a c. & f. basis against letters of credit or documentary drafts can be made by authorized dealers without the prior approval of the Director of Exchange Control; most other forms of payment for imports require approval. Insurance on imports must be effected locally. The National Company for Foreign Trade has a monopoly over imports of all consumer goods, with the 531 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN exception of medical supplies and hospital equipment, which are handled by the National Company for Drugs. It is also the sole importer of automobiles and other vehicles, of all government requirements, and of most requirements of the public hospitals, as well as other specified items. Imports into and exports from the free port zones within the port of Aden are free of exchange and trade controls (except in respect of transactions between these zones and the rest of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen) and are exempt from customs duties, except that the proceeds of exports and re-exports financed originally by the authorized bank are subject to the surrender requirement (see section on Prescription of Currency, above). In all cases, exporters from the free zones are required to undertake to repatriate in convertible currencies commissions, profits, and other expenses relating to the processing of goods in the zones and to surrender the currencies to the autho- rized bank. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require prior approval by the Director of Exchange Control. The "Inducement to Invest Law" divides foreign investments into two categories: (1) projects which realize self-sufficiency in their requirements for foreign currency; these may remit net annual profits due on invested capital within the limit of the credit of their exports; and (2) projects of primary importance for the national economy; these may remit the whole of the annual net profits due on capital invested. Projects that were set up prior to 1971 may remit all of their net profit. The basic exchange allow- ance for tourism is the equivalent of YD 125 a person a trip to all destinations (50 percent of this amount for children aged between two and ten years). Allowances for medical treatment abroad are normally granted in accordance with the amount estimated by the Ministry of Health. Allowances for other types of travel are granted on the merits of the application. Foreign employees of approved enterprises are allowed to remit abroad be- tween 50 percent and 100 percent of their total earnings (net of taxes) according to the terms of the contract; other foreign employees, if receiving their salaries from abroad, are allowed to remit 70 percent of their total earnings. Nonnationals doing business in the country can remit abroad up to YD 50 a month for family mainte- nance. All insurance is nationalized; existing policies have been transferred to the National Insurance and Reinsurance Company, and payments abroad in respect of premiums are not permitted. Travelers may take out the equivalent of YD 5 in domestic bank notes and up to the equivalent of YD 125 in traveler's checks, foreign bank notes, or other foreign means of payment. Nonresi- dents may take out any foreign exchange declared upon entry. Exports and Export Proceeds Most exports are subject to individual licensing. All exports to Israel are prohibited. Except for exports to 532 neighboring countries specified by the Foreign Exchange Committee, export proceeds must be received in con- vertible currencies within six months of shipment and must be sold to authorized dealers upon receipt. Pro- ceeds of exports or re-exports to neighboring countries may be surrendered in the national currency of the importing country. Proceeds from Invisibles All claims of residents for services rendered to nonresidents must be collected in foreign currency (or received from an External Account) and surrendered to the authorized dealer. Travelers may freely bring in foreign bank notes; imports of more than YD 5 in domestic currency are subject to a tax of 50 percent. Tourists are required to spend in foreign exchange an amount equivalent to YD 50 a month or US$10 a day if the duration of their stay is less than one month. Capital Virtually all capital payments and transactions require prior approval. Expatriates are normally permitted upon departure to remit their entire savings to their country of permanent residence. Foreign investments that have been approved under the Inducement to Invest Law (enacted in 1981) may be granted exemptions from import duty and various other tax facilities. Five years after investment, the net value of the enterprise (cal- culated on the basis of assignment, actual liquidation, or book value, whichever is less) is transferable at the rate of 25 percent a year; if, however, the owner of the Yemeni, Arab, or foreign capital encounters operational difficulties, his capital may, upon approval, be retrans- ferred to its place of origin one year after entry. This provision also applies to the reinvested part of such capital. Interest due on any loans obtained abroad after the firm concerned has been established may also be remitted, provided that all duties, taxes, and other government dues have been paid. Projects authorized under this law are exempt from income tax for up to five years from the commencement of production and may carry losses forward. Gold Only the monetary authorities and authorized dealers may purchase, hold, or sell gold bullion. Licensed goldsmiths may purchase, hold, and sell other unworked gold and gold coin and ornaments. Other residents may hold gold in the form of ornaments or numismatic coins. Exports and imports of gold by registered goldsmiths require licenses issued by the Ministry of Trade and Supply (General Department for Foreign Trade); in certain cases, the consent of the Foreign Exchange Committee must also be obtained. Departing female residents may take out gold ornaments not exceeding 20 to las1, subject to registration in their passports. Arriving female nationals may bring in gold ornaments 'One tola is equal to 180 grains troy or 0.4114 ounce. ©International Monetary Fund.

Not for Redistribution YUGOSLAVIA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Yugoslavia is the Yugoslav Dinar. The authorities do not maintain the exchange rate of the dinar within announced margins. All transactions, other than those effected under the procedures set forth for certain countries with which Yugoslavia has bilateral payments agreements (see section on Prescription of Currency, below), take place at an exchange rate adjusted from time to time by the authorities. The buy ing and selling rates for the U .S. dollar in the foreign exchange market in Belgrade on December 31, 1984 were Din 211.4313 and Din 212.0665, respectively, per US$1; on the same date, the exchange rate in terms of the U .S. dollar for transactions on bilateral accounts was Din 190.7475 per US$1. Rates are also quoted for certain other currencies.l Administration of Control* The Federal Assembly formulates the decision on foreign exchange policy of the country for each year; the projections of the balance of payments and the foreign exchange balance of Yugoslavia are component parts of this decision. The Federal Executive Council (FEC) prescribes the general provisions in respect of foreign trade and exchange operations. The Federal Secretariat for Foreign Trade makes decisions governing certain foreign trade transactions and issues import and export licenses and instructions when required. It is also charged with securing balanced trade with payments agreement countries. The Federal Secretariat for Fi- nance, the National Bank of Yugoslavia, and the Nation- al Banks of the republics and autonomous provinces ad- minister the exchange controls. The National Bank of Yugoslavia prescribes the methods of payment to and from foreign countries. The Yugoslav Community of Interest for Foreign Economic Relations (CIFER), in co- operation with the Yugoslav Chamber of the Economy, prescribes uniform criteria on the basis of which enter- prises conclude internal self-management agreements on the allocation of foreign exchange within the framework of either: (1) one or more of the 22 general associations within the Yugoslav Chamber of the Economy; or (2) 12 special forms of associations approved by the Yugoslav CIFER (mainly large business conglomerates). Foreign exchange transactions must be carried out through an authorized bank, of which there are two types: (1) fully authorized banks, which are permitted to engage in transactions with foreign countries and may engage in all foreign exchange transactions in Yugo- slavia and abroad, as well as in foreign credit operations (including the granting of guarantees); (2) banks wh ich are authorized to conduct foreign exchange operations in Yugoslavia only; they may neither keep foreign ex- change accounts abroad nor engage in foreign credit operations, except through banks authorized to engage in foreign exchange transactions abroad. Authorized ex- change offices may only purchase foreign bank notes and traveler's checks; this status is open to all commercial and savings banks. In addition, hotels and tourist agencies, if specifically authorized, may also purchase foreign bank notes and traveler's checks. Commercial exports and imports may be effected by all economic organizations (both producing and trading undertakings) registered for this purpose. Economic organizations that are not registered to conduct foreign trade channel their imports and exports through eco- nomic organizations that are authorized to engage in foreign trade transactions. Resident physical persons may not engage in foreign trade. Prescription of Currency Payments to and from countries with which Yugos- lavia has bilateral payments agreements are made in the currencies, and according to the procedures, set forth in those agreements. Yugoslavia has payments agreements requiring denomination of transactions in clearing U .S. dollars with Albania, Czechoslovakia, the German Dem-: ocratic Republic, Mongolia, and the U .S .S .R. Nonresident Accounts Foreign juridical and physical persons may maintain accounts denominated in foreign exchange and in dinars in Yugoslavia according to the following rules: for- eigners resident outside Yugoslavia may freely open accounts in convertible currencies or in dinars with fully authorized banks in Yugoslavia; foreign missions and foreigners resident in Yugoslavia may freely open accounts expressed in foreign currencies or dinars with any authorized bank. Foreign exchange accounts in convertible currencies of nonresident juridical and physical persons are kept in the currency deposited.2 Balances held in these accounts may be used for all payments in Yugoslavia, in dinars or in the currency concerned, and abroad, in any convert- ible currency. Transfers from these accounts are free if made in the currency in which the account is kept; outward transfers in other convertible currencies are subject to the bank holding the account being prepared to make the necessary conversion.

Not for Redistribution Nonresident foreign exchange accounts in bilateral currencies may be opened only for certain foreign juridical and physical persons resident in Yugoslavia. Balances may be used only for dinar payments in Yugoslavia or for retransfer to the country to which the bilateral account is related. Foreign juridical and physical persons may in certain cases and under specified conditions open nonresident accounts in dinars with authorized banks. Such accounts can be credited freely with amounts whose transfer in convertible currency has been authorized. The possibil- ity of use of dinars from such accounts in Yugoslavia and the degree of transferability of the funds depend on the origin of the dinar deposits. Nonresident juridical and physical persons may also open other dinar accounts with authorized banks. These other accounts may be credited with dinars acquired in Yugoslavia in accordance with the existing regulations. Balances are, in principle, nontransferable and may be spent in Yugoslavia only for noncommercial payments by the account holder or by members of his immediate family, or by the owner and staff of foreign firms if the account holder is a foreign juridical person. If balances on these accounts derive from copyright royalties, from work performed in Yugoslavia by foreigners, from pensions, disability allowances, compensations to per- sons decorated with the Order of the National Hero, or from alimony payments, transfers may be effected under specified conditions. Resident nationals may maintain foreign exchange accounts or foreign exchange savings deposits in con- vertible currencies with any authorized bank. These accounts are kept in the deposited foreign currency and bear interest paid in dinars, or in dinars or foreign exchange for foreign exchange accounts of Yugoslavs temporarily working abroad. Foreign exchange accounts may be retained indefinitely and, although cash with- drawals from most banks are limited to US$250 a month on the basis of self-management agreements, other payments in Yugoslavia and abroad on behalf of the account holder or members of his immediate family can be made freely; balances are not transferable to other persons or accounts (see section on Proceeds from Invisibles, below). Yugoslav nationals residing abroad and former emigrants returning to Yugoslavia may also open foreign exchange accounts in Yugoslavia, subject to the same limitations. Imports and Import Payments Commercial imports may be effected only by eco- nomic organizations registered as participating in foreign trade. Most major industrial producers are so registered, in addition to economic organizations that specialize in foreign trade. For import of certain basic foodstuffs, such as hard wheat, rice, butter, and special kinds of edi- ble oil, quotas are fixed by the Federal Executive Coun- cil; importation of such goods is carried out either by particular economic organizations or through the Federal Office for Food Reserves, on the basis of public bids. YUGOSLAVIA For most commodities, import licenses are not re- quired. All commodities included in the foreign trade nomenclature are classified in three categories: LB— liberalized goods; RK and DK—goods subject to quan- tity or value quotas; D —imports subject to ad hoc licensing. Goods in the LB category are mainly raw materials, foodstuffs, and spare parts, but also some consumer goods. Protective equipment for workers and all other goods not specifically included in the RK, DK, or D lists are also liberalized and free from any quantitative restriction. Foreign exchange for payments for imports from the convertible currency area is taken out of an enterprise's retained foreign exchange earnings provided on the basis of self-management agreements concluded within the above-mentioned associations in any convert- ible currency appropriate to the exporting country. Payments for imports from payments agreement coun- tries must be made in the manner prescribed in the relevant agreement and may be restricted according to the availability of funds in the appropriate clearing account. Imports under commodity quotas (RK list or DK list) are raw materials, manufacturing components, equip- ment, and consumer goods; limits are established for certain other goods. The quotas are established either in quantities (RK) or in dinars (DK). The allocation among importers of goods subject to quota is decided by agreement among the economic organizations within the Chamber of Economy of Yugoslavia.3 Additional quotas may be allocated during the year if the enterprise to which the quota is allocated undertakes to increase exports. Goods in list D comprise gunpowder, firearms and ammun i t ion, petroleum, certain types of lubricants, drugs, and natural gas. Import licenses are required only for list D commodities. For certain goods there is an additional requirement of a special import license ("accordance") issued by the Federal Secretariat for Foreign Trade. At the end of 1984 goods subject to this requirement comprised 71 LB items, 13 RK items, and 2 DK items. The items include a wide range of tropical foodstuffs and fru i ts, raw materials, cocoa butter, fats and oils, raw cotton, textiles, and tin; the Secretariat may also prescribe direct importation from the country of origin. Private persons who are Yugoslav nationals and hold foreign exchange accounts with Yugoslav banks may use these funds freely to import goods for their own use or for the use of close relatives residing with them and for purchases of certain domestically produced goods with dinars obtained by selling foreign exchange held in these accounts. 3In principle, any such allocation among importers must be agreed on among economic organizations w i t h in the Chamber of Economy according to projections of material balances for each commodity, wh ich are based on the projected growth rates of production. If the importers are unab le to agree among themselves or if the allocation decided upon does not correspond to established principles, the Fed- eral Secretariat for Foreign Trade is authorized to decide on the d is tr ibu t ion. 535 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution YUGOSLAVIA Yugoslav nationals who have worked at least two years abroad continuously may import capital equipment necessary for performance of a legally permitted profes- sional activity, provided that such equipment is imported within a three-year period from the date of return and that the value of each shipment is below Din 3,500,000. They may also freely import spare parts for maintenance of capital equipment. In addition, self-employed Yugo- slav nationals may import intermediate goods necessary for performance of a legally permitted professional activity, up to the value of Din 500,000 a year; this amount may be increased if the Yugoslav national in question employs other people. Yugoslav nationals may import motor vehicles through consignments if payment is made through a foreign exchange account held at a Yugoslav bank; they may also import motor vehicles directly from abroad if they have spent at least four years abroad or have worked at least two years abroad since November 28, 1984, provided that they return for permanent residence in Yugoslavia. In addition, they may import motor vehicles inherited abroad, and (up to November 1984) they could import motor vehicles purchased out of an insurance indemnity received for motor vehicles that have been destroyed and had origin- ally been paid for in foreign currency. Imports of motor vehicles are also permissible for those who are military invalids or foreign nationals asking for permanent residence in Yugoslavia. A 1 percent tax for customs evidence and a 6 percent tax-equalization charge are payable on all commodities not exempt from customs duty. Many agricultural commodities are subject to variable import levies. Returning resident travelers may bring in duty-free imports up to Din 200 a person. There are special facilities for full or partial exemption for payment of customs duties on certain imports by Yugoslav workers returning from abroad. Payments for Invisibles Foreign exchange to cover expenses abroad for export promotion is made freely available to exporters. Pay- ments for other invisibles in relation to reproduction needs may be made from the remitter's own foreign exchange funds or from the foreign exchange accounts of organizations of associated labor on the basis of self- management agreements at the overall national level and in a small amount within the self-management com- munities of interest of the republics and autonomous provinces. Purchases of services abroad, as well as spare parts, fue l, etc., by Yugoslav enterprises involved in international freight and passenger transportation are liberalized. There is no exchange allowance for tourist travel abroad. However, Yugoslav citizens are allowed to use balances from their foreign exchange accounts for tourist travel abroad. Under specified conditions, the following transfers may be effected abroad: payments for improving labor relationships, pensions, disability allowances, and pay 536 ments to recipients of an Order of the National Hero; alimony payments, payments for court-ordered compen- sations or indemnities, the profits of foreign contractors performing capital construction work in Yugoslavia; and 10 percent of the proceeds from cultural, entertainment, sport, and other performances given by foreign groups or individuals. In addition, copyright royalties are transfer- able abroad if such transfers are based on reciprocity and if foreign exchange resources have been provided. Payments in respect of royalties and alimony granted by court order are fu l ly transferable, but if a payment is to be made to a country with which Yugoslavia maintains a bilateral payments arrangement, then such payment may be made only if the agreement in question provides for reciprocity. Transfers to convertible currency countries of funds realized by nonresidents from selling property inherited in Yugoslavia can be effected on the basis of the approval of the Federal Secretariat for Finance under conditions of reciprocity in inheritances and in transfers. Authorized banks may sell foreign currency to resi- dents for payment of medical treatment abroad, for remittances for court and other fees abroad, and for specified personal expenses on the basis of approval from the appropriate authorities in the republics and autonomous provinces. Not more than Din 2,500 in domestic currency, in denominations of Din 1,000 or less, may be taken out (or brought in) by travelers on the first trip during the year, and Din 500 a person can be taken out (or brought in) on subsequent trips during the same year. Foreign travelers may bring in and take out any amount in foreign exchange without declaring it. Exports and Export Proceeds Foreign exchange earned through exports of goods and services and other forms of economic cooperation with foreign countries, as well as through purchases on the foreign exchange market, belongs to the particular organizations of associated labor that have taken part in its realization. An organization of associated labor may keep earned foreign exchange in the foreign exchange account, may sell it to an authorized bank, or may use it for its own payments abroad in accordance with the existing regulations. Exporters are required to surrender 44.1 percent of foreign exchange earnings to the National Bank of Yugoslavia and 10 percent of such earnings to the account of the republic or province in which they are situated. If the foreign exchange needs of an exporter, determined within the appropriate association as a percentage of projected exports, is less than 45.9 per- cent, the difference is to be sold to the banking system within two days of receipt. Any portion of an exporter's earned foreign exchange which can be retained to satisfy its foreign exchange need but is not used within 15 days is also required to be sold to the banking system. In principle, exports are free of control. Certain raw materials that are in short supply in the domestic market (including petroleum and petroleum derivatives, certain livestock, vegetable oils) and certain other materials ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution such as gunpowder, weapons, and narcotic drugs require licenses. Unless specifically exempted, proceeds from exports must be repatriated within 90 days from the date of exportation, or within 180 days under specified conditions. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles must be repatriated within 90 days from the date on which the claim is payable. The performance of construction and engineering services is subject to approval ("accordance") by the Federal Com- mittee for Energy and Industry. Exchange proceeds may be used for payments abroad connected with the activi- ties of the economic organization concerned, including payments for purchases of equipment and other material for capital construction work abroad. The exchange proceeds are transferable to Yugoslavia within 30 days from work completion and belong to the economic organizations that have earned them, or they can be sold to authorized banks. With specified exceptions, proceeds from services are subject to the same surrender require- ments and procedures as are proceeds from exports of goods. Residents who, while employed abroad, deposited their savings in foreign savings banks and obtained a "bilingual savings book," issued under specific ar- rangements between Yugoslavia and foreign banks, may withdraw their balances in the form of foreign exchange when in Yugoslavia. Residents may hold interest- bearing foreign currency accounts in Yugoslavia. The accounts may be credited with the fu ll amount of a person's savings in foreign exchange. These accounts may be used for the personal needs of the account holder and of his immediate family; cash withdrawals are limited to US$250 a month and they are not transferable to other persons or accounts and may be retained indefinitely. Not more than Din 2,500 in Yugoslav bank notes, in denominations of Din 100 or less, may be brought in by travelers on the first trip during the year, and not more than Din 500 on subsequent trips during the same year. Capital The organizations of associated labor and other social legal persons may borrow abroad in accordance with the general legislation established by the FEC and the unified criteria established by CIFER. All borrowing is subject to approval by the National Bank. Foreigners may invest in Yugoslav economic organ- izations but only through joint ventures. There is no limit on the share of foreign investment in the organization's capital. Profit transfers are permitted in proportion to the share of the foreign partner's contributions to the income generated on the basis of the resources invested and up to the amount of foreign currency earned by the joint venture from exports of goods and services. If the law governing joint ventures were to be amended, the legal provisions in force on the date of registration of a joint YUGOSLAVIA venture would continue to be applied during the entire life of the investment contract, if the foreign investor so desires, or, at the latter's option, any more favorable provisions of the amended legislation could be applied. Foreign firms are permitted to establish representational offices in Yugoslavia. The investment income earned abroad by Yugoslav economic organizations must be repatriated within 90 days. Residents are obliged to repatriate foreign ex- change held or accruing abroad on capital account. Economic organizations wishing to participate in foreign enterprises may be allowed to export the neces- sary capital under special conditions set by federal law; such capital should be registered with the Federal Secretariat for Foreign Trade. Enterprises are in principle expected to settle external debt-service obligations on the basis of earned foreign exchange. However, if an enterprise is unable to do so, it is permitted by law to draw progressively on the foreign exchange resources of its associated group of enter- prises, on its own bank, on all banks in the republic or province of residence, or on a pool established at the National Bank of Yugoslavia on the basis of part of the 44.1 percent surrendered by all enterprises. Gold In 1968 the National Bank issued certain commemora- tive gold coins, which are legal tender. Foreign travelers are freely permitted to import and export these coins, subject to customs declaration, and for exports, subject to proof that they have been purchased in Yugoslavia. Residents who are private persons may hold gold coin in Yugoslavia but cannot export them except with the approval of the National Bank of Yugoslavia. Such gold coin may be sold to any authorized bank, and they may freely hold, purchase, and sell gold jewelry and other articles of gold in accordance with the existing regula- tions on trade in goods and on control of articles made from precious metals. Domestic economic organizations that have been registered as traders in gold may import gold jewelry under the DK import regime; they may freely export gold jewelry and other articles of gold. Authorized banks may freely export gold coin. Producers may export newly mined gold or sell it to specified users at home at the average price on the international gold market. Domestic sales of newly mined gold by the producers may be made at a price which equals the average quotation in free gold markets abroad. Domestic economic organizations using gold for their normal activities may purchase gold from domestic producers or abroad on the basis of quotas allocated to each such organization ind iv idua l ly. Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement The buy ing and selling rates of the Yugoslav dinar were changed on numerous occasions during 1984, involving a depreciation from Din 127.2445 and Din 127.6268 = US$1, respectively, on December 31, 537 ©International Monetary Fund.

A law amending and supplementing the existing Law on Foreign Exchange Operations and Credit Relations with Foreign Countries came into effect, changing the surrender requirements to the National Bank of Yugoslavia and the accounts of republics and provinces. The Law also specified rules on the basis of which organizations of associated labor (enterprises) were to allocate earned foreign exchange for various purposes according to self-management agreements (see below "Exports and Export Proceeds"). As in previous amendments to the law, priority was to be given to the settlement of debt-service obligations. January 1. The Decision on Common Yugoslav Foreign Exchange Policy passed by the Federal Assem- bly went into effect, according to which specified amounts of foreign exchange surrendered to the National Bank of Yugoslavia were allocated for imports of specific products and raw materials. The decision also laid down certain general rules to be applied in the case of imports of equipment: equipment was expected to be imported on credit and on the condition that such equipment could not be procured in Yugoslavia under approximately the same terms and conditions. Foreign borrowing for the importation of capital goods should respond to the general objective of increasing the future net foreign exchange inflow and the development of the less advanced regions. January 13. Unified criteria were adopted by the Yugoslav CIFER, on the basis of which enterprises were to allocate foreign exchange earnings (see below "Ex- ports and Export Proceeds"). The unified criteria deter- mined that only 10 percent of an enterprise's allocation of foreign exchange could be used as a downpayment on imports of equipment or for payments for spare parts. Exports and Export Proceeds January 1. A law amending and supplementing the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations and Credit Rela- tions with Foreign Countries came into effect, according to which certain surrender requirements were changed and rules were specified by which organizations of associated labor (enterprises) were to allocate the re- maining foreign exchange on the basis of self-manage- ment agreements. The portion of foreign exchange to be channeled to the National Bank of Yugoslavia was established at 44.1 percent of export earnings in a separate decision of the Federal Assembly. In the same decision of the Federal Assembly, it was determined that the portion of earned foreign exchange to be surrendered to the account of the republic or province in which an enterprise was situated should be established in a fixed amount not to exceed 10 percent of projected foreign exchange earnings; any excess over the fixed amount was to be sold to the banking system. The remaining portion of foreign exchange (45.9 percent) was to be allocated among enterprises on the basis of self-manage- ment agreements. Organizations of associated labor (enterprises) were to determine their foreign exchange needs either within one or more of the general associa- tions of the Yugoslav Chamber of the Economy or within approved special associations which constituted large production associations at the Yugoslav national level. The foreign exchange needs were to be determined on the basis of unified criteria to be adopted by the Yugoslav CIFER in cooperation with the Yugoslav Chamber of the Economy. January 13. The Yugoslav CIFER adopted unified criteria on the basis of which enterprises were to allocate foreign exchange earnings. Retention rates for the repay- ment of foreign financial obligations were set at the ratio of estimated obligations in 1984 to total export receipts in 1983. Basic retention rates for production needs were fixed at 90 percent of the ratio of such needs (excluding capital goods) to exports during 1982-83. The retention rates were made subject to revision, should they prove inconsistent with balance of payments developments. Payments for Invisibles October 20. The amount of dinars that could be taken out on a traveler's first trip during the year was increased from Din 1,500 to Din 2,500, and the amount for each subsequent trip was increased from Din 200 to Din 500. December 23. The official limit on the repatriation of profits by a foreign partner in a joint venture was raised from the equivalent of one half to the total of a joint venture's foreign exchange earnings from exports of goods and services. Capital February 2. Unified criteria were adopted, setting down conditions under which raw materials, semi- manufactures, spare parts, and equipment could be imported on credit terms. November 27. A new law on joint ventures was adopted, eliminating existing restrictions on the shares a foreign partner could hold in joint ventures. In addition, the new law made it possible for a foreign partner to play a significantly larger role in the management of a joint venture. 538 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ZAIRE (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Zaire is the Zaire. Following the exchange reform of September 12, 1983, a temporary dual exchange rate arrangement was introduced, consist- ing of an official market restricted to the operations of the Bank of Zaire (the central bank) and a free market covering the transactions of the rest of the banking system. The arrangement called for the Bank of Zaire to fix the official rate on the basis of the prevailing free market exchange rate, the latter being determined by the interplay of supply and demand in the interbank market. Initially the official rate was kept within a margin of 10 percent of the free market rate; the margin was reduced progressively to 5 percent on October 15, 1983, to 2.5 percent on December 29, 1983, and on Feb- ruary 28, 1984 the two rates were unified. A weekly fixing is conducted every Friday, under which the fixing rate is set at a level which allows the largest buying bid to be transacted; bids without limits are effected first, and to the extent possible those for specified amounts could be effected on a split basis. Whatever is the weekly fixing rate, commercial banks are free to negotiate the rates in their daily transactions among themselves, as well as with their clients. The exchange rates for the zaire against 19 currenciesl in which authorized banks (and other intermediaries) are permitted to deal are published daily by the Bank of Zaire; the rates for the zaire against these currencies, other than the U.S. dollar, are fixed daily by the Bank of Zaire on the basis of the SDR rates for these currencies. Forward exchange transactions are authorized under specified conditions. In addition to a commission charge of not more than 1 percent, foreign exchange transac- tions between the authorized commercial banks and nonbank customers are subject to an exchange control fee of 3 per mil, payable to the Bank of Zaire. There are no commission charges or exchange fees on foreign exchange transactions in the interbank market. Administration of Control The Bank of Zaire has regulatory authority over all foreign trade and payments, including discretionary power to authorize residents to hold foreign exchange abroad and to use it to pay for certain goods and services. The Public Debt Management Office (OGEDEP), oper- ating under the aegis of the Department of Finance and Budget, manages the medium- and long-term external public and publicly guaranteed debt, is responsible for its servicing, and advises the Executive Council on external debt policy, including guarantees extended by the Gov- 1 Belgian francs, Burundi francs, Canadian dollars, CFA francs, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Kenya shillings, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portu- guese escudos, pounds sterling, Rwanda francs, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U .S. dollars. ernment on loans contracted by public, semipublic, and private enterprises. In principle, no new external bor- rowing may be contracted or guaranteed by the Gov- ernment without the prior advice of OGEDEP and the Bank of Zaire. Prescription of Currency Payments from nonresidents must be received in the listed convertible currencies quoted by the Bank of Zaire (see footnote 1). Special authorization for the acceptance of any other currency may be given only in respect of currencies that can be exchanged freely without a discount. Except for working balances, all currencies received must be converted into a convertible currency. Payments to nonresidents must be made in one of the listed convertible currencies; certain settlements with Angola, Burund i, and Rwanda are made through special accounts established under arrangements concluded by the Bank of Zaire with the central banks of the countries concerned. Balances on these special accounts are settled on a quarterly basis in convertible currencies. Virtually all settlements (other than for re-exports) with the member countries of the Banque des Etats de TAfrique Centrale (BEAC)2 are effected through the Central African Clearing House (Chambre de Compensation de TAfrique Centrale). Nonresident Accounts There are four categories of nonresident accounts: Nonresident Foreign Currency Accounts, Nonresident Convertible Accounts (comptes etrangers convertibles), Nonresident Ordinary Accounts (comptes etrangers or- dinaires), and Nonresident Special Accounts (comptes etrangers indisponibles). All nonresident accounts are noninterest-bearing sight deposits, and no overdraft is permitted. Nonresident Foreign Currency Accounts, as well as nonresident convertible and special accounts, can be opened without the prior authorization of the Bank of Zaire at any authorized commercial bank. With a few exceptions, the opening of nonresident ordinary accounts requires the prior authorization of the Bank of Zaire; such authorization is not required when accounts are opened for embassies and other diplomatic missions (including those representing international and official multinational organizations), official civil and military missions, representative offices in Zaire of foreign transportation companies, and nonresidents entitled to receive payments in zaires for services rendered in Zaire under agreements with or approved by the Executive Council or the Bank of Zaire. 2Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Congo, and Gabon. 539 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ZAIRE Nonresident foreign currency accounts may be cred- ited for foreign currency payments by residents in the following cases: (a) payments authorized by the Bank of Zaire', (b) transfers of foreign currencies from nonresi- dent convertible accounts; (c) foreign exchange proceeds resulting directly from arbitrage transactions; (d) inward transfers in foreign currencies from nonresidents and from foreign exchange accounts held abroad; (e) pay- ments in foreign currencies made by nonresidents; and (f) transfers in foreign currencies from other nonresident foreign currency accounts. Nonresident foreign currency accounts may be debited for payments in foreign currency to residents in the following cases: (a) pay- ments authorized by the Bank of Zaire; (b) sales of foreign currency to any authorized commercial bank against zai'res with proceeds to be transferred to nonresi- dent convertible accounts; (c) foreign exchange proceeds from arbitrage transactions in foreign currencies; (d) outward transfers in foreign currencies; (e) transfers to other nonresident foreign currency accounts; (f) with- drawals of bank notes or traveler's checks by the holder of such accounts; and (g) banking commissions and fees. Nonresident Convertible Accounts may be credited for (a) spot purchases of domestic currency against foreign currencies on the interbank market; (b) transfers from other nonresident convertible accounts as well as from nonresident foreign currency accounts; and (c) payments by authorized commercial banks for services rendered in Zaire and authorized for settlement in either domestic or foreign currency by the Bank of Zaire. They may be debited for (a) payments (with the prior authorization of the Bank of Zaire) to residents for services rendered in Zaire (excluding exports of goods and services), (b) pur- chases on the interbank market of foreign currencies and of any forms of payments for travel expenses abroad, (c) transfers to other nonresident convertible accounts and purchases of bank notes or any other form of payment in zai'res at any authorized commercial bank, and (d) banking commissions and fees. Nonresident Ordinary Accounts may be credited with (a) sales of foreign exchange against zai'res, received as down payments or transferred from abroad; (b) transfers in zaires from nonresident convertible accounts; and (c) receipts in zai'res from residents on account of services rendered in Zaire, rental of real estate properties and working equipment and facilities, transportation fares, consular and chancery fees, and other services as specified by the Bank of Zaire at the time of opening such accounts. Nonresident ordinary accounts may be debited with (a) payments in zai'res to residents on account of local purchases of goods and services, dues, taxes, and banking commissions and fees; (b) transfers to other nonresident ordinary accounts of the same holder; and (c) withdrawals of bank notes or any other means of payment in zaires. In addition, assets held in nonresident ordinary accounts are not transferable abroad, nor can they be transferred to nonresident convertible accounts. Nonresident Special Accounts can be opened for nonresidents entitled to receive specified payments on 540 account of (a) sale or rent from real estate properties and other fixed capital located in Zaire and owned by nonresidents; and (b) sale of businesses and goodwills, as well as shares in agricultural, commercial, industrial, and service companies located in Zaire and owned by nonresidents. In addition, all assets denominated in zaires and owned by non-Zairian residents finally depart- ing from Zaire must be deposited in or transferred to a nonresident special account opened on behalf of or under the name of the respective persons, as are proceeds from sale of real estate or the renting of fixed capital owned by non-Zairian residents who subsequently become nonresi- dents. Accounts under this category can be debited only for (a) travel expenses incurred by the holders of such accounts up to a maximum of SDR 150 a day (for a maximum period of two months); (b) transportation fares (excluding airline tickets) incurred by the holders when traveling within Zaire; (c) transfers to religious organiza- tions or any nonprofit cultural, philanthropic, or social organizations (up to a maximum of SDR 10,000 a year); (d) banking commissions and fees; (e) state and local taxes due in Zaire; (f) medical fees; (g) insurance and maintenance fees of fixed capital (including real estate properties); and (h) any other payment authorized by the Bank of Zaire. Imports and Import Payments Importation of a number of goods consisting mainly of arms, explosives and ammunition, narcotics, materials contrary to public morals, certain alcoholic beverages, and equipment for aerial and maritime navigation is prohibited (or requires a special authorization from the Executive Council) on grounds of public policy. Impor- tation of secondhand utility vehicles for agriculture and forestry requires a prior authorization from the Ministry of National Economy, Industry, and Foreign Trade. Imports of a number of items classified as nonessential imports (namely, crude petroleum oils, petroleum or mineral oils, petroleum gas, inorganic or organic compo- nents of radioactive elements, rare earth metals and isotopes, powders and explosives, pyrotechnical prod- ucts, matches, pyrophoric alloys, and combustible mate- rials) require prior approval by the Bank of Zaire. All other imports are subject only to an import declaration at the authorized banks. Applications for import licenses for nonessential imports are submitted through authorized banks, which, after certification, forward them to the Bank of Zaire for approval. The import license application is returned to the authorized bank for prior approval (visa); approval is generally granted within two days upon verification that the fiscal requirements and authorizations from the respective ministries are obtained. Import licenses vali- dated by the authorized banks and import declarations registered by them remain valid for customs clearance for six months, but the validity may be extended if shipment has begun. Extension of the validity period requires authorization from the Bank of Zaire. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Payments for imports may be made either upon arrival or upon shipment (including payments up to 30 days from date of shipment). Payments upon shipment are authorized provided that the importer obtains a 6 percent rebate on the f.o.b. value. Means of payment must be indicated on all import declaration forms. Interest pay- ments on foreign financing for imports are authorized only if the importer has obtained a supplier's credit or other form of foreign financing with a maturity of at least 90 days, and provided that no advance deposit in foreign currency with the foreign correspondent of the autho- rized bank involved has been made. To open an uncovered letter of credit, an importer is required to make a deposit in zai'res equivalent to 50 percent of the total amount, calculated at the prevailing exchange rate. A detailed record of all financing charges is required to be submitted by the foreign correspondent to the domes- tic authorized bank and is used as a basic document to justify any payments of import financing charges. Financing charges are treated as invisible payments associated with the import transaction involved and in accordance with the provisions of Article 10 of Circular No. 199 regarding the foreign exchange allocation sys- tem for commercial banks. Authorized banks are allowed to pay transportation costs and shipping insur- ance in foreign currency only for import payments made on an f .o .b. basis. In principle, the amount, the invoice price, and the quality of all imports must be verified and found acceptable by the foreign agents of the Office Zairois de Controle (OzAC), but importers are not required to submit to their banks the verification certifi- cates delivered by OZAC (or any of its agents abroad) with respect to preshipment controls for imports paid upon delivery in Zaire with a value ( f .o .b .) of less than SDR 1,000. Prior approval of the Bank of Zaire is required for (a) imports transported by air carriers other than Air Zaire with charges payable in foreign currency to foreign airline companies, or transported by air with charges payable in foreign currency to resident airline compa- nies, if the transportation costs exceed the f .o .b. value by 20 percent; (b) imports in the form of foreign grants to residents other than the state and subordinate authorities, whenever the value exceeds SDR 1,000; (c) imports with a value in excess of SDR 1,000 in the form of foreign contributions to capital; (d) imports financed with sup- pliers' credits or other forms of foreign financing with a maturity exceeding one year, other than those contracted or guaranteed by the Government and which carry interest charges; (e) imports requiring a down payment in foreign currency prior to shipment; and (f) all imports financed with means of payment other than foreign exchange purchases from authorized commercial banks in Zaire, proceeds from foreign accounts held abroad with the authorization of the Bank of Zaire, foreign grants, foreign contributions to capital, and customary short-term foreign trade financing. Prior approval of the Bank of Zaire is not required for (a) imports in the form of foreign grants to the state and ZAIRE subordinate authorities or financed through suppliers' credits or other forms of foreign credit with a maturity of more than one year contracted or guaranteed by the Government; (b) imports for use in the operations of foreign transportation companies represented in Zaire; (c) diplomatic imports; (d) imports in the form of foreign grants in kind with a value of up to SDR 1,000 (up to unlimited amounts for imports in the form of foreign grants to recognized religious, philanthropic, scientific, or cultural organizations); (e) commercial samples with- out market value; (f) imports in the form of foreign contributions to physical capital with a value of up to SDR 1,000; (g) goods for personal use imported into Zaire in connection with relocation; (h) baggage and personal objects of travelers; (i) imports of journals, periodicals, and newspapers for personal use as well as for domestic sale, as permitted by the Executive Council; (j) imports in the form of foreign contributions to capital under the Investment Code or the ZOFI regime; (k) imports of up to SDR 200 transported by Air Zaire and with freight payable in foreign currency; (1) emer- gency imports of spare parts, Pharmaceuticals, and precision instruments with a value of up to SDR 1,000; and (m) imports of data processing equipment, provided a prior authorization has been granted by SPIZ. Imports effected under bilateral aid arrangements between Zaire and specified countries (Belgium, Can- ada, the People's Republic of China, the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States) are governed by separate provisions. Certain import payments have been delayed. These arrears have largely been centralized at the Bank of Zaire, which is in the process of settling them in accordance with due dates and the availability of foreign exchange. Arrears on payments due to official creditors and to some commercial banks have been the subject of rescheduling or refinancing agreements. Payments for Invisibles In principle, all payments for invisibles are subject to authorization by the Bank of Zaire. The Bank of Zaire will not authorize the payment in foreign exchange of commissions in favor of shippers or purchasing agents. Imports and exports between Zaire and ports in Belgium, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Netherlands, and the Scandinavian countries must be shipped in vessels participating in the conference of the Associated Central West Africa Lines. Banks are not authorized to pay in foreign currency the maritime freight on shipments that do not meet these regulations, unless an immediate discount is obtained on the invoice. For other items, declarations of foreign exchange commitment are subject to prior approval by the Bank of Zaire. Banks may effect maritime freight payments in foreign currency at the time of shipment only for imports payable upon shipment; they may also effect maritime freight payments in foreign currency at the time of shipment for imports payable upon arrival, provided that the payment is made directly to the carrier. Maritime freight charges may be 541 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ZAIRE paid in Zaire in local currency when goods are trans- ported entirely by the Compagnie Maritime Zai'roise. Other payments relating to services performed by nonresidents are, in principle, permitted. However, outward remittances of remunerations by expatriate employees during the year are limited to the levels authorized during 1981; the transfer abroad of salaries of newly hired expatriates is limited to 50 percent of salary, provided that the nontransferable amount is sufficient to meet local needs. Medical and pharmaceutical expenses incurred by expatriate personnel on leave are no longer reimbursable. Transfers pertaining to certain administra- tive expenses that firms incur abroad, interest on private loans, and payment of certain portions of insurance premiums are generally permitted. Transfers of net profits of firms with foreign participation have been suspended, except where the transfer of such profits is expressly guaranteed by the Investment Code or by bilateral agreements. Transfers of nonresidents' rental income are suspended. Payments for commissions, management and miscellaneous fees, and royalties may be authorized in some cases. Tickets for travel abroad may be purchased in Zaire for trips starting in Zaire. However, residents of Zairian nationality may travel by a foreign airline only with the permission of the Department of Transportation and Communication. Zairian nationals traveling abroad on official missions may buy foreign exchange in amounts that depend on the duration of the journey and the status of the traveler. Residents in Zaire are allowed to purchase foreign exchange at the authorized commercial banks to cover the following expenditures: travel ex- penses, medical expenses, and students' tuition and living costs, as well as training expenses incurred abroad. For trips to Burundi and Rwanda, tourists and households residing in the border area are entitled once a month to purchase the equivalent of SDR 100 in Burundi or Rwanda francs. The import (or export) of Zairian notes and coin as well as of other Zairian means of payments by both residents and nonresidents is prohibited. However, the import of such means of payment by travelers from Burundi and Rwanda remains authorized. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports not covered by general declarations re- quire individual declarations. Banks are normally autho- rized to approve such declarations. The declaration must specify the nature of the merchandise to be exported, the price, and the currency in which payment is to be received. Declarations of foreign exchange commitment are normally valid for 45 days; within this period, the proceeds must be received and surrendered. However, receipts from agricultural exports can be repatriated within three months of validation. Coffee may be exported only by recognized coffee exporters; such exports are subject to quality control. Special provisions apply to mineral production of the Generate des Car- rieres et des Mines du Zaire (GECAMINES), which is 542 authorized to retain 45 percent of its export proceeds, or 1.2 billion Belgian francs a month, whichever is greater, with banks abroad or in Zaire, for meeting its own payments abroad, and must surrender the remainder of its proceeds as well as any end-of-month balances on retained earnings in excess of BF 800 million to the Bank of Zaire. Partial nonrepatriation and retention abroad are also permitted for a limited number of other enterprises, including the Societe de Developpement Industriel et Minier du Zaire (SODIMIZA—75 percent) and the Societe Miniere de Bakwanga (MiBA—20 percent), while fu ll retention of export receipts in accounts abroad is per- mitted in some other cases, notably the oil corporations. The trade of artisanal gold and diamonds is in principle free, with exports being channeled through authorized marketing agencies (comptoirs agrees). Industrial dia- monds are sold through the De Beers Group. M in imum export prices have been established for coffee, cocoa, tea, ivory, papain, rauwolfia, and cinchona. The export of Zairian notes and coin, as well as other Zairian means of payment, is prohibited. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles may be retained by the authorized banks. Provided that they make the necessary declaration, nonresident travelers may bring in any amount in foreign means of payment and may take out on departure the amount declared on entry less the equivalent of the expenses incurred during their stay in Zaire. Capital The repatriation of foreign capital brought in under the provisions of the Investment Code is guaranteed, as is the transfer of profits and dividends on such capital. With minor exceptions, transfers abroad of capital owned by residents or nonresidents are not authorized. Gratuitous transfers of ownership of real estate are subject to approval by departmental ordinance. The net foreign currency asset position of authorized banks is not permitted to exceed 75 percent of their own resources. Certain capital repayments have been delayed. Arrears on principal repayable to official creditors and some commercial banks are the subject of consolidation agreements. Gold Residents other than the monetary authorities and producers of gold are not allowed to purchase, hold, or sell gold in any form. With the exception of jewelry, imports and exports of gold require prior authorization from the Bank of Zaire. Gold produced by mining companies is purchased by the Bank of Zaire under agreed terms. The Bank of Zaire may authorize part of the gold produced by these companies to be sold to residents for their industrial activities. There is free trade in domestic gold mined by small-scale producers. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ZAIRE Changes During 1984 Exchange Arrangement March 1.

Not for Redistribution ZAMBIA (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Zambia is the Zambian Kwacha, for which the intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. Be- ginning Ju ly 6, 1983, the kwacha is pegged to a basket of currencies based on Zambia's trade with its major trading partners. Zambia avails itself of margins of 2.5 percent around the fixed relationship with the currency basket. The Bank of Zambia deals with the Government and with authorized banks in U .S. dollars and pounds sterling. Authorized banks are free to deal in other currencies at rates based on daily rates provided by the Bank of Zambia, or on the basis of cross rates with the U .S. dollar prevailing in international foreign ex- change markets. In its dealings with the commercial banks the Bank of Zambia applies a margin of 0.25 percent for purchases of foreign exchange and 0.50 percent for sales. On December 31, 1984, the Bank of Zambia's buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar were K 2.1953 = US$1 and K 2.2118 = US$1, respectively. Authorized banks are permitted to charge an additional 1 percent on either side for sales and purchases of U .S. dollars, and 1.50 percent for sales and purchases of other currencies, when quoting their rates to customers. A levy of 10 percent is imposed on sales of foreign exchange for overseas travel. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Bank of Zambia under powers delegated to it by the Minister of Finance. Much of the authority for approving normal current payments is in turn delegated to commercial banks authorized to deal in foreign exchange. The control of trade is the responsibility of the Ministry of Commerce, which also issues import and export li- censes. Overall import policy is determined by the Ministerial Committee on Foreign Exchange. Prescription of Currency Authorized payments, including payments for im- ports, by residents of Zambia to residents of other countries may be made in any foreign currency. Pay- ments from residents of other countries may be received in sterling or in Zambian currency from an External Account, or in any foreign currency freely exchangeable for U .S. dollars or sterling. All permitted commercial transactions with residents of Zimbabwe are subject to the same exchange control provisions as are applied to any External Account country. Nonresident Accounts Accounts in Zambian currency held w i th authorized banks by residents of other countries are designated 544 External Accoun ts .* These accounts may be credited with authorized payments from residents of Zambia, with transfers from other External Accounts, and with the proceeds from sales of any foreign currency by nonresidents to authorized banks. They may be debited for payments for any purpose to residents of Zambia, for transfers to other External Accounts, and for purchases of any foreign currency from authorized banks. Blocked Accounts in Zambian currency held with authorized banks by residents of any country other than Zambia are credited with nontransferable capital sums in Zambian currency. All debits and credits to such accounts require the prior approval of the exchange control authorities, except that the accounts of emigrants may be debited each year for the permitted anniversary allowance for a remittance to the country of residence of the account holder. Normally, approval is given for the investment of balances on Blocked Accounts in Zambian securities, provided that these are held in Zambia to the order of an authorized dealer. The interest on Blocked Account balances is freely transferable to the account holder's country of residence. Imports and Import Payments The import from all countries of certain specified commodities is prohibited for reasons of health, safety, or public policy. Personal and household effects, sam- ples, diplomatic shipments, and means of transportation entering Zambia temporarily do not require individual import licenses, nor do any other goods for personal use and consumption, provided that the person importing them does not import more than K 50 worth of such goods in any period of 90 days. However, no payment may be made for goods not licensed, even where the value is less than K 50. The import of goods up to a value of K 500 that does not involve a remittance of foreign exchange is also exempt from a licensing requirement. The Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines and the Ministry of Health are granted priority for bona fide requirements. The Controller of Customs is autho- rized to admit emergency goods imported without prior reference to the Ministry of Commerce. All other imports require individual import licenses. Import licensing aims at containing imports within a quarterly exchange allocation established by the Ministe- rial Committee on Foreign Exchange, in consultation with the Bank of Zambia. However, subject to approval, imports may be licensed without allocation of exchange. All imports under individual licensing are divided into three-digit groups following the Standard International Trade Classification system and into end-use groupings. 'Au thor ized banks are required to obtain prior permission of the exchange control authorities before designating any new External Account except where the account is to be opened for a temporary visitor. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Exchange allocations are specified for each of these categories. Normally, raw materials, intermediate goods for further processing in Zambia, Pharmaceuticals, and fuel and electricity are licensed liberally; alcoholic beverages, tobacco, durable consumer goods, and other consumer goods are licensed restrictively. No licenses are being issued for items that are also produced locally. In principle, foreign exchange for import payments is automatically made available once an import license has been obtained, subject to presentation of the relevant documents to an authorized bank, including a clean report of findings issued by the Societe Generate de Surveillance (SGS) of Geneva, which verifies the price, quality, and quantity in the country of origin or ship- ment. In practice, foreign exchange can be obtained only if the authorized bank has such resources at its disposal. Importers must obtain the approval of the Bank of Zambia before letters of credit can be opened by the commercial banks, and all financial arrangements be- tween importers and foreign suppliers for the supply of goods on credit must be approved by the Bank of Zambia. All imports except those financed by suppliers' credits must be financed by letters of credit with minimum terms of 90 days. The commercial banks are notified every six months about the maximum amount of letters of credit that each bank may open. Importers intending to import goods not involving use of official foreign exchange must obtain the prior approval of the Bank of Zambia before applying to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry for a "no funds" import license. Importers must have the import license approved by the Ministerial Committee on Foreign Exchange before presenting it for approval by the Bank of Zambia and subsequently to the commercial banks for the issuance of letters of credit. The commercial banks are required to submit to the Bank of Zambia a weekly return on letters of credit opened, giving specified information. Most imported goods are subject to a sales tax of 12.50 percent of taxable value, which is calculated as the sum of (1) 120 percent of the customs value; (2) the applicable customs duty; and (3) 25 percent of the sum of (1) and (2). Certain import payments are in arrears; these arrears have been centralized, and the Bank of Zambia is settling them in accordance with certain priorities. Payments for Invisibles Payments in foreign exchange for freight and other charges on imports require the prior approval of the Bank of Zambia. The basic exchange allowance for business travel is K 150 a person a day for up to 12 days a calendar year and is limited to two trips a year; exchange for this purpose must have the prior approval of the exchange control authorities. Applications for remittance abroad of part or all of payments for advertising, management, accounting, administrative, engineering, and consulting services rendered to residents by nonresidents are subject to individual approval by the Bank of Zambia, which generally grants the required permission, provided that ZAMBIA the fees charged are reasonable, that they relate to existing contracts, and that these services cannot be provided domestically.2 Profits and dividends of sub- sidiaries and branches of companies whose head offices are situated outside Zambia may be transferred abroad up to 15 percent of the nonresident share of the equity capital, or 50 percent of net profits accruing to the nonresident owners of incorporated companies, which- ever is smaller.3 Expatriate farmers are permitted to remit 12.5 percent of their after-tax profits including profits earned from a partnership or private limited company engaged in farming. A further 10 percent may be held to their credit every year for eventual remittance when they leave Zambia. Such remittances are allowed once a year after the end of the accounting year. The remittance of depreciation allowances is not permitted. Any airline not landing and picking up passengers in Zambia is not allowed to remit funds abroad except for those funds already accumulated in Zambia. Foreign nationals employed in Zambia on a contract made after December 4, 1971 are allowed to remit one third of their annual earnings (subject to a maximum of K 7,000) to the country nominated when the contract was registered with the exchange control authorities. Foreign nationals availing themselves of these arrange- ments are not entitled to the regular allowances for travel, education, maintenance, etc.; their leave salary, gratuity, and other terminal benefits are transferable only on completion of the contract period and are subject to a ceiling of K 8,000 on departure, or on completion of contract. Remittances of up to K 20 a year are normally approved by the exchange control authorities for family maintenance. Travelers leaving Zambia may take out a maximum of K 10 in Zambian currency. Certain current payments for invisibles are in arrears. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports valued at over K 50 require a license, except those covered by an open general license; minerals are exported under general agreements with the mining companies. The export of certain metals is reserved, in principle, for an official agency, the Metal Marketing Corporation. Certain commodities are subject to licensing mainly to ensure domestic supplies of needed goods and of certain strategic materials, such as implements of war, lead in any form, certain minerals, petroleum products, certain rough and uncut precious stones, scrap and old metals, and jute bags. For most goods, however, export licenses are issued freely. Export proceeds in foreign currency appropriate to the country of destination must be offered for sale to an authorized bank within six months of the date of shipment; the Zambian Corporation for Copper Mining 2 Services rendered by a parent company abroad to its branch or wholly owned subsidiary in Zambia are not generally approved. 3An auditor's certificate must be submitted to the effect that the amount to be transferred represents bona fide realized profits derived from the year's operations after fu ll provision has been made for local taxation. The profit and loss account and balance sheet for the year in respect of which application is being made must also be submitted. 545 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ZAMBIA may retain up to 35 percent of its export proceeds to meet its own needs, but the balance must be credited to a Bank of Zambia account in London upon receipt. All exports must be financed through irrevocable letters of credit and be registered with the Bank of Zambia. As an incentive, up to 50 percent of export proceeds is allowed to be retained for a specified time period by the exporter on application to the Bank of Zambia. Unless evidence of conversion of at least an equivalent amount in exchange can be provided, hotel bills payable by nonresidents must be settled in foreign exchange. Nonnational agricultural producers are eligible for certain incentives in the form of foreign exchange, on the basis of every standard bag of maize, wheat, soybeans, or tobacco sold by them in excess of the prescribed number of bags. Corresponding foreign exchange incen- tives for national agricultural producers are made avail- able on application to the exchange control authorities. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in any currency must be offered for sale to an authorized bank. There is no limitation on the amount of foreign currency notes that may be imported by travelers, except that travelers from Zaire are allowed to import only up to the equivalent of K 20. Travelers arriving in Zambia may bring in a maximum of K 10 in Zambian currency. Capital Inward transfers of capital are not restricted, but with the exception of overseas short-term financing of imports other than certain capital goods, all borrowing outside Zambia requires the approval of the exchange control authorities. Outward transfers of capital are controlled, but nonresidents are normally permitted to repatriate their investments when they have satisfied the authorities that the original investment was made with funds brought into the country from sources outside Zambia. The repatriation is generally spread over a period longer than three years. Local borrowing by companies con- trolled either directly or indirectly from outside Zambia is restricted to a debt-equity ratio of 1 to 3. However, the Bank of Zambia permits borrowings in excess of this limit for certain priority sectors of the economy, pro- vided that the borrowings secure higher employment opportunities or savings of foreign exchange. In general, residents are not permitted to transfer capital abroad and, w i th certain exceptions, are required to offer for sale to an authorized bank any foreign exchange which accrues to them. As a special measure, however, residents may purchase Zambian securities quoted on recognized stock exchanges abroad, provided that the securities so acquired are registered in the names of specified nominees and tha t, in the event of subse- quent disposal of these securities, the sales proceeds will be repatriated. All income earned from these investments must be repatriated. Emigrants are granted exchange as follows: (1) Per- sons 50 years of age and over are allowed K 8,000 on departure, and subsequent annual transfers of K 5,000. (2) Married persons under 50 are allowed K 4,000 on departure, together with K 250 for each child, up to a maximum of K 5,000 for a family un i t. Thereafter, annual transfers of K 3,000, together with K 250 for each child, up to a max imum of K 4,000 for a family unit are permitted. (3) Unmarried persons under 50 are allowed K 2,000 on departure, and subsequent annual transfers of K 1,500. In addition to their emigration allowance, emigrants may remit gratuities, compensa- tion payments, up to one third of leave pay, and terminal benefits up to a maximum of K 8,000 on departure, or on completion of contract. In addition, there are special facilities for expatriate farmers for the transfer of profits up to certain limits (see section on Payments for Invisibles, above). Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Zambia for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require exchange control approval as well as import or export licenses issued by the Minister of Commerce; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. Gold-bearing sludge is exported by copper companies for refining and sale abroad. Foreign exchange for imports of gold may be provided with the permission of the Bank of Zambia. Changes During 1984 Exports and Export Proceeds January 27. The proportion of export receipts that the Zambian Corporation for Copper Mining could retain for its own use was raised from 25 percent to 35 percent. In addition, authorization was granted for nonmineral ex- porters, under specified conditions, to retain up to 50 percent of export proceeds for their importation of essential inputs. 546 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ZIMBABWE (Position on December 31, 1984) Exchange Arrangement The currency of Zimbabwe is the Zimbabwe Dollar. The exchange rate of the Zimbabwe dollar is determined on the basis of a fixed relationship to a trade-weighted basket of currencies. The U .S. dollar is the intervention currency. The spread applied by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe between the buying and selling rates is 0.8 percent for major currencies and 1.0 percent for other currencies. An additional 0.25 percent on either side of the quoted rates of major currencies may be charged by authorized dealers (authorized commercial and merchant banks). The authorized dealers base their rates for other currencies on current international market rates. On December 31, 1984 the official buying and selling rates for the U .S. dollar quoted by the Reserve Bank in its dealings with authorized dealers were US$0.6700 and US$0.6612, respectively, per Z$ l. Forward exchange contracts are permitted only for trade transactions. There is no limit on the amount of such contracts, but these must be limited to periods of three to six months. The Reserve Bank is prepared to cover forward transactions and, at present, quotes fixed dis- count or premium rates for major currencies. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Reserve Bank, under powers delegated to it by the Minister of Finance, Economic Planning and Development, in terms of the Exchange Control Act, Chapter 170, and the Exchange Control Regulations of 1977. Authorized dealers have been empowered to approve certain foreign exchange transactions in accordance with Exchange Control Instructions Issued to Authorized Dealers (July 1, 1981, as amended) and Exchange Control Circulars issued periodically. Import and export controls are administered in accordance with the Control of Goods (Import and Export) (Agriculture) Regulations of 1965, as amended, the Control of Goods (Import and Export) (Commerce) Regulations of 1974, as amended, the Control of Goods (Export of Minerals and Metals) Order, 1979, the Control of Goods (Open General Import License) Notice of 1979, and the Control of Goods (Open General Export License) Notice, 1977. Prescription of Currency All payments by nonresidents to residents must be effected in denominated currencies,l with the exception of payments otherwise specified or effected through nonresident accounts. Under the Clearing House ar- 1 There are 17 denominated currencies which are freely convertible through authorized dealers: Austrian sch i l l ings, Belgian francs, Cana- dian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, South African rand, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. rangement which went into effect on February 1, 1984, w i th in the Preferential Trade Area for Eastern and Southern African States (PTA), member countries can use national currencies in the settlement of payments during a transaction period of two calendar months; net balances at the end of this period require settlement in convertible currencies. Nonresident Accounts Nonresident accounts may be opened w i th the ap- proval of the exchange control authorities by persons who have never been residents of Zimbabwe. Nonresi- dent accounts may be credited with foreign currencies, with payments from other nonresident accounts, or with payments by residents that would be eligible for transfer outside Zimbabwe. Nonresident accounts may be deb- ited for payments to residents, for payments to other nonresident accounts, or for payments abroad. Only former residents now residing outside of Zimbabwe may maintain emigrants' accounts in Zimbabwe. Cash assets held in Zimbabwe in the names of emigrants must be blocked in these accounts, and all payments to and from these accounts are strictly subject to various exchange restrictions. Imports and Import Payments With the exception of products covered by the Open General Import License (OGIL), all imports are subject to licensing requirements. (At present the OGIL covers very few items.) Import licenses are issued only against a certificate of foreign exchange allocation. Global foreign exchange allocations are decided by an Interministerial Committee, chaired by the Ministry of Finance, Eco- nomic Planning and Development, and are made avail- able through the Ministry of Trade and Commerce and the Ministry of Industry and Technology. The Ministry of Trade and Commerce basically handles allocations for goods in the commercial category, while those in the industrial category are handled by the Ministry of Industry and Technology. Imports in the commercial category include imports by merchants of raw materials, machinery, and spare parts for resale to manufacturers and the public sector, as well as consumer goods; those in the industrial category consist of direct importation by industrialists of raw materials, machinery, and spare parts. For purposes of allocating commercial imports, ind iv idual products are classified into five categories in accordance w i th the degree of essentiality. (In the manufac tur ing sector, because of employment conside- rations, similar priority ratings are not so strictly ap- p l ied .) Foreign exchange is allocated to individual commercial importers for single tariff items (w i th facili- ties for a limited degree of transferability between items), whereas foreign exchange allocated to manufac- turers is for a group of tariff items appropriate to the 547 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ZIMBABWE industrial division concerned. Manufacturers receive through the Ministry of Industry and Technology sepa- rate allocations for raw materials required for production for the local and export markets; the former is assessed on the basis of priority and foreign exchange availability, while the latter is in the form of initial allocations based on past performance, with possible additional allocation from an export revolving fund against proof of exports. Import licenses have to be drawn against foreign exchange allocation certificates at the time orders are placed. The normal validity of import licenses is six months from the end of the month of issue, but the validity period can be extended in certain circumstances. Import licenses are normally issued without geographical restriction and importers are free to choose the country of supply. Licenses are issued on an f.o.b. basis and do not, therefore, cover the invisibles element of the transactions. Imports of certain goods (mostly agricultural and processed food products) require a special permit issued by the Ministry of Agriculture. Certain agricultural products (coffee, maize, sorghum, soybeans, and wheat) may be imported only by the Grain Marketing and Cotton Marketing Boards or by others with the permis- sion of the Boards. No quotas are in force, but seasonal restrictions are applied in the case of certain agricultural products. Authorized dealers may approve applications to effect payments for authorized imports, provided necessary documentation (including the details of import licenses or open general licenses) is submitted. Payments for imports into Zimbabwe from all countries may be made in Zimbabwean currency to a local nonresident account or in any foreign currency. The customs duty regime consists mainly of ad valorem duties, which range up to 40 percent, and speci- fic duties on a number of products. Generally, imports are subject to an additional tax of 18 percent or 23 per- cent, which is the countervailing levy to the sales tax imposed at the same rates on goods sold domestically. Most imports are subject to a surtax of 20 percent. Payments for Invisibles Foreign exchange to pay for invisibles related to imports and, within certain limits, for other purposes is provided by commercial banks under delegated author- ity. Applications for foreign exchange exceeding the limit established for commercial banks are approved by the Reserve Bank, which deals with each case on its merits. The basic foreign exchange allowance for holiday travel is Z$60 a day up to a maximum of Z$360 for a 12-month period. The allowance may be accumulated up to three years but it is not granted in advance. (Children under ten are entitled to one half of these amounts.) A fee of 20 percent is applied on sales of foreign exchange for purposes of holiday travel. The basic foreign ex- change allowance for import-related business travel is Z$100 a day up to a max imum of Z$l ,500 a trip, with an 548 overall annual maximum of Z$3,000; for export-related business travel, the exchange allowance is Z$125 a day for a maximum of Z$2,000 a trip and an annual limit of Z$4,000. Applications for business travel allowance exceeding the specified limits are subject to the approval of the Reserve Bank. Foreign exchange is provided for education abroad beyond the secondary school level, within the following limits: Z$2,750 a year for education at universities other than those in the United States and the United Kingdom, and Z$6,000 a year for education at specified universities in the United States and the United Kingdom. For medical treatment, foreign ex- change is provided up to Z$20 a day for a maximum period of 30 days for the patient and any necessary accompanying companion. Remittances of up to Z$40 for subscriptions to religious and educational societies, and Z$20 for other societies are allowed; the limit for an initial membership fee is Z$50. Remittances to close relatives permanently resident outside Zimbabwe, not exceeding Z$30 a month for each individual beneficiary and Z$60 a month for each family un i t, are permitted with the approval of the Reserve Bank. Outward remit- tances in respect of fees for technical, administrative, management, and consultancy services or to defray external expenses of local branches are subject to a tax of 20 percent. Beginning from March 27, 1984, all remittances of dividends, branch and partnership profits, rent and other income from nonresident equity holdings are suspended, with the exception of dividends and profit remittances on venture capital that came in after September 1, 1979. Suspended remittances may be lodged in deposit ac- counts at an annual interest rate of 2 percent with designated banks, for fu ture release. Beginning also from March 27, 1984, remittances of incomes from blocked funds (blocked dividends, interest, and other incomes, including 50 percent of after-tax profits) are suspended. Holders of blocked funds are allowed to invest these funds in Government of Zimbabwe external bonds: for individuals, in the form of 12-year, 4 percent interest external bonds, on which only interest is remitta- ble during the first six years, and the capital could be redeemed in equal installments from the seventh to the twelfth year, with interest accruing on the reducing balance; for corporate bodies, blocked funds in the form of 20-year, 4 percent interest external bonds, on which only interest is remittable during the first 10 years, and the capital could be redeemed in equal installments from the eleventh to the twentieth year, with interest accruing on the declining capital balance. (Prior to these changes, income from blocked funds was not freely remittable, except for a portion of the funds invested in government external bonds with a maturity of six years and an annual interest rate of 4 percent.) Outward transfers of interest earnings are subject to a tax of 10 percent. Applications for emigrant status must be submitted to the Reserve Bank. Beginning from March 27, 1984, the settling-in allowance that can be remitted abroad by ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution emigrants is limited to Z$ 1,000 per family un i t. In exceptional and deserving cases, the exchange control authorities will consider applications exceeding this maximum. Before these changes, transferable allow- ances at the time of emigration were as follows: (1) single persons under the age of 40 years, Z$500; (2) single persons aged 40-59 years, Z$l ,000; (3) family units and single persons with dependents (under 60 years of age), Z$ 1,000; (4) family units (husband over 60 years of age) and single persons over 60, Z$7,000; (5) persons over 80 years of age, Z$l0,000; (6) widows (no age restriction), Z$ 10,000; and (7) handicapped or disabled persons, Z$l0,000. A further release of capital is made as an annual allowance on the anniversary date of the emigrant's departure, as follows: persons over 65 years of age, Z$2,000 and persons over 70 years of age, Z$3,000. Beginning from April 1, 1984, all those applying for emigrant status are required to take steps to liquidate their assets within a period of six months and to invest the total proceeds, less any settling-in allowance granted, in Government of Zimbabwe external bonds. In exceptional cases of emigrants unable to comply with the six-month limit, the matter could be referred to the Reserve Bank. A traveler leaving Zimbabwe may take out, as part of the travel allowance, not more than Z$20 in Zimbab- wean currency, together with a maximum of the equiva- lent of Z$20 in foreign bank notes. Nonresident travelers may take out traveler's checks they imported, less the amount sold to authorized dealers. Upon departure from Zimbabwe, nonresident travelers may reconvert unspent Zimbabwean currency into foreign currencies against presentation of exchange certificates. Exports and Export Proceeds Licenses are required to export certain products which are not covered by the OGIL; these include (1) any ore, concentrate, or other manufactured product of chrome, copper, l i th ium, nickel, t in, or tungsten; (2) petroleum products; (3) ju te and hessian bags; (4) road or rail tankers for carrying liquids or semiliquids; (5) b i tumen, asphalt, and tar; (6) wild animals and wild animal products; (7) certain wood products; (8) ammonium nitrate; and (9) implements of war. In addition to security and social reasons, export licensing require- ments are intended to ensure adequate domestic supply of essential products. Goods may not be exported without permission, unless the customs authorities are satisfied that payment has been made in an approved manner or will be so made within three months from the date of shipment or such longer period as may be permitted by the Reserve Bank. Payments for exports must be received within 90 days in the following manner: (1) in a denominated currency; (2) in Zimbabwean currency from a nonresident account; and (3) in the case of Malawi and Botswana, by checks drawn in Malawi kwacha or Botswana pu la, respec- tively. Under the PTA arrangement (see above under Prescription of Currency) member countries can use ZIMBABWE national currencies in the settlement of payments during a transaction period of two months, with net balances at the end of this period to be settled in convertible currencies. Exports to some 50 countries are approved only upon advance payment of export proceeds or if payment is covered by an irrevocable letter of credit issued or confirmed prior to export by a reputable overseas bank. Export receipts must be sold to autho- rized dealers. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles are required to be sold to authorized banks within a reasonable period of time. Residents performing professional services abroad are not permitted to retain any part of their foreign exchange earnings, and such earnings are required to be sold to an authorized bank. Foreign currency and traveler's checks may be imported without restrictions but must be sold or exchanged in Zimbabwe only through authorized deal- ers. A traveler may bring in Zimbabwean currency up to a maximum of Z$20. Capital Inward transfers of capital through normal banking channels are not restricted. Outward transfers of capital are controlled, but all foreign investments, irrespective of their source, which are undertaken through normal banking channels since September 1, 1979 may be considered for repatriation after two years, subject to the requirement that the amount to be repatriated will be reduced by any profits remitted in the interim. Where such authority is granted, the balance may be transferred only through the estab- lished medium of external government bonds bearing interest at the rate of 4 percent a year. The repatriation of capital invested before Septem- ber 1, 1979 is prohibited; however, shareholders are allowed within limits to apply to the Reserve Bank for the remittance of such capital upon the sale of shares to local residents, and if such application is approved, the capital is invested in external government bonds bearing interest at the rate of 4 percent a year. Beginning from March 27, 1984, former residents holding blocked assets, and new emigrants, are allowed to invest their funds in Government of Zimbabwe external bonds with a maturity of 12 years and an annual interest rate of 4 percent. The remittability of the Zimbabwean pension of a former resident is guaranteed under the Constitution. All other outward transfers of capital are subject to approval by the Reserve Bank, as are dealings in external securities. Gold The export of gold in unmanufac tured form is con- trolled and licensed under the Control of Goods (Export of Minerals and Metals) Order, 1979. The administration of the Order is the responsibility of the Ministry of Mines. No person may export any precious metal and certain other specified metals and minerals unless he 549 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ZIMBABWE holds an export license; no such licenses for gold are issued. These controls do not, however, apply to the Reserve Bank. The import of gold is controlled by the Gold Trade Act. The Act provides for certain require- ments to be met when a person intends to import gold into Zimbabwe. No person, either as principal or agent, is entitled to deal in or possess gold unless (1) he is the holder of a license or permit; or (2) he is the holder or distributor of a registered mining location from which gold is being produced; or (3) he is the employee or agent of any of the persons mentioned in (1) and (2) above, and is autho- rized by his employer or principal to deal in or possess gold in the lawful possession of such employer or principal. A m in ing commissioner may issue to any person a permit authorizing him to acquire or to be in possession of or to dispose of any gold, provided the quantity does not exceed one troy ounce. In all other cases, permission can only be issued by the Secretary for Mines. Three types of licenses may be issued under the terms of the Gold Trade Act: a gold dealing license, a gold recovery works license, and a gold assaying license. Barclays Bank International Ltd. is the only authorized dealer under the terms of the Act, and each holder or distributor of a registered mining location is required to lodge with this bank all gold acquired by him in the course of his operations by the tenth day of the month following that in which the gold was produced. When a person intends to smelt any gold or any article containing gold, he must first obtain a license issued by a district commissioner under the terms of the Second Hand Goods Act authorizing him to be in possession of smelting equipment. Changes During 1984 Prescription of Currency February 1. The Clearing House Arrangement under the Preferential Trade Area for Eastern and Southern African States (PTA) entered into operation, and the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe was chosen to manage the functions of the arrangement during the first two years. Imports and Import Payments July 27. The du ty on motor spirit was increased from Z$0.55 per liter to Z$0.625 per liter. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles March 27. Regulations on invisible transactions were modified as follows: (a) all remittances of dividends, branch and partnership profits were suspended, but remittances of dividends and profit on venture capital that came in after September 1, 1979 were allowed under the old rules; (b) all remittances of rent and other incomes from nonresident equity holdings were sus- pended; (c) the max imum settling-in allowance remitta- ble abroad by emigrants was reduced to Z$ 1,000 a fam i ly un i t, with a provision that in exceptional and deserving cases, applications for amounts beyond this limit would be considered by the exchange control authorities; (d) the Government announced its decision to acquire the foreign-currency-denominated securities held by nominee companies on behalf of residents and nonresidents, in exchange for local currency holdings; (e) remittances of income from blocked funds of compa- nies and ind iv idua ls were suspended, and it was an- nounced that holders of blocked funds could invest them in Government of Zimbabwe external bonds; and (f) a regulation was introduced, requiring those applying for emigrant status to take steps to liquidate their assets within a period of six months and to invest the total proceeds, less any settling-in allowance granted, in Government of Zimbabwe external bonds. July 27. A fee of 20 percent was introduced on sales of foreign exchange for purposes of holiday travel, and a nonresidents' tax of 20 percent was introduced on royalties. 550 ©International Monetary Fund.
