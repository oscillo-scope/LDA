Introduction 1 The course of the world economy d u r i ng 1973 and ear ly 1974 was ma rked by a succession of d rama t ic deve lopmen t s. Among these were the crest of a m a jor boom in world p roduc t ion and trade, an e x t r a o r d i n a ry upsurge in p r im a ry com- mod i ty prices, the most severe i n f l a t i on s ince World War II in the i n d u s t r i al coun t r ies, unp rece- dented increases in the costs of f u e l, and w ide swings in m a rk et exchange rates for most of the leading cu r r en c i es and in the pr ice of gold. In v o l ume te rm s, world t rade rose by some 13 per cent in 1973, compared w i th an average a n n u al ga in of about 8 per cent over the p r ev ious decade. Because of h igh rates of i n f l a t i on in the i n d u s t r i al coun t r ies in p a r t i c u l ar and the ve ry sharp rise in p r im a ry c omm o d i ty pr ices, an excep- tional increase in export and impo rt u n it va lues also con t r ibu t ed to a steep rise in t r ade va lues. Measured in t e rms of the U.S. do l lar ( and t h us re f lec t ing — in add i t ion to the fac to rs ju st men- t ioned — the e f fec t ive dep rec ia t ion of t h at cu r rency f rom 1972 to 1973), the increase in the average u n it v a lue of goods mov ing in world t rade was on the order of 20 per cen t, and the increase in aggre- gate do l l ar va lue was well over 35 per cen t. As a resu lt of the sharp upwa rd movement of commod i ty prices, the t e rms of t rade of develop- ing coun t r ies imp roved sub s t an t i a l ly in 1973, despite the rise in costs of impo r ts of m a n u f a c- tured goods. The imp rovement in the te rms of trade was espec ia l ly no tab le in the case of the o il expo r t ing coun t r ies, but was qu i te m a rk ed even f or m a ny o t h er le ss d e v e l o p ed c o u n t r i e s. A l though, as a group, the nono il expo r t ing less developed coun t r ies were able to en large the ir net impo r ts in real t e rms because of the be t ter te rms of t rade in 1973, the ex te rnal position of a sub s t an t i al n um b er of these coun t r ies imp roved l i t t le, if at a l l. W i th in f lows of cap i tal show ing some f u r t h er expan s ion, the combined overall balance of p a ym e n ts surp lus of the deve lop ing coun tr ies rema ined h igh. The un se t t led cond i t ions of world exchange ma rke ts of recent years con t inued in 1973 and early 1974. Some of the sa l ient deve lopmen ts in the ear ly pa rt of 1973 were the in t roduc t ion of a dual exchange m a rk et by I ta ly w i th e f fect f rom 1 The period u n d er rev iew in th is R epo rt covers 1973 and the ea r ly p a rt of 1974.

As no ted in the p rev ious Report, on Ma rch 12, 1973 the Counc il of M in is ters of the European Economic C omm u n i ty (EEC) 2 issued a state- m e nt reco rd ing dec is ions t h at inc luded the fol- low ing: ( 1) t he m a x im um ma rg in between t he Be lg ian f r a n c, the Dan ish k rone, the deu tsche m a r k, the French f r a n c, the Lux embou rg f r a n c, and the N e t h e r l a n ds gu i lder would be ma in ta ined at 21A per cen t; in the case of member states op e r a t ing a two- t ier exchange m a rk et th is under- s t and ing wou ld app ly on ly to the regulated mar- ke t; and (2) the cen tral b anks would no longer be obliged to in t e rv ene to m a in t a in the marg ins p rev ious ly observed for the U.S. do l lar. Ge rmany, in concert w i th t h is ac t ion, apprec ia ted the deu t- sche m a rk in t e rms of special d raw ing r igh ts (SDRs) by 3 per cen t. On March 16, a f t er a M in is te r ial Meeting of the G roup of Ten 3 and the EEC, a s t a t em ent was issued in wh ich, in ter alia, the M in is te rs and Governors ( 1) took note of the decisions of the membe rs of the EEC announced on March 12; 2 M emb er c o u n t r i es of the EEC are B e l g i um, Den- m a r k, France, G e rm a n y, I r e l and, I t a l y, Lux embou rg, N e t h e r l a n d s, and U n i t ed K ingdom. 3 The G r o up of Ten are c o u n t r i es t h at p a r t i c ip a te in the G en e r al A r r a n g em e n ts to Borrow, viz., Be lg ium, Canada, France, G e rm a n y, I ta ly, Japan, Ne the r land s, Sweden, U n i t ed K ingdom, and Un i ted States.

From the start Norway and Sweden became par- ticipants in the EEC's 21A per cent marg ins a r rangemen ts. At the same t ime Be lg ium, France, the Ne ther lands, and Sweden announced addi- tional measures designed to prevent undes ired capital inf lows. W i th in the EEC's 21A per cent marg ins ar- rangemen ts the currencies moved considerably and the a r rangement came und er strong pressure at t imes. In June the deutsche ma rk was appre- ciated by 5.5 per cent, in September the Ne ther- lands gu i lder was appreciated by 5 per cen t, and in November the Norwegian krone was appreciated by 5 per cent, all in terms of SDKs. At va r ious t imes du r ing 1973 the French f r a nc came und er pressure, pa r t icu la r ly in September fo l low ing the revaluation of the gu i lder. On J a n u a ry 19, 1974 France advised the Fund tha t, d u r i ng the next six mon ths and on a provisional basis, the ex- change rates between the French f ranc and cer ta in other currenc ies in the off ic ial m a rk et would not necessarily be confined w i th in the ma rg ins h i th e r to observed; the dual exchange ma rket was not e l im ina ted u n t il March 21, 1974. The Opera- tions Account c o u n t r i e s4 followed France in these actions. On the fo l low ing day, I ta ly elimi- nated its dual exchange ma rke t. The U.S. do l lar and the pound sterling, wh ich serve as in te rven t ion currencies for a large num- ber of developing and p r im a ry p roduc ing coun- tries, were weak in te rms of the cu r renc ies of countries par t ic ipa t ing in the EEC's 21A per cent m a rg ins a r rangemen ts du r ing a large part of 1973. The U.S. dollar, for examp le, at mid-year had depreciated by as much as 9-15 per cent in te rms of these var ious currenc ies since Ma rch; late in the year and in J a n u a ry 1974 it appreciated by near ly a s im i lar amoun t. The weakness of these two in te rven t ion currenc ies, together with the balance of p aym en ts strength o r ig ina t ing in the p r im a ry p roduc ts boom, prec ip i ta ted nume rous 4 Coun tr ies whose i n s t i t u t es of issue m a i n t a in an Opera t ions Account w i th the French T rea su ry; they are Cameroon, Cen t ral A f r i c an Repub l ic, Chad, People's Republic of the Congo, Dahomey, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Ma l i, N iger, Senegal, Togo, and Upper Volta. 4 exchange rate actions. Thus, Australia declared a new par value, reva lu ing its currency by 5 per cent in te rms of gold in September 1973; Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda established new central rates in June 1973, when they appreciated the ir currenc ies by 3.5 per cent, only to depreciate th e ir currencies by a s im i lar amount when they established new cen tral rates in Janua ry 1974 fo l low ing the s treng then ing of the U.S. dollar; The Gamb ia appreciated its currency by 25 per cent in terms of sterling in March 1973; South A f r ica, together w i th Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaz i land, appreciated the va lue of the rand by 4.8 per cent in relation to the U.S. dollar when, w i thout announc ing any new marg ins, it quoted new b u y i ng and selling rates for the rand in te rms of the U.S. dollar in J u ne 1973. A considerable n um b er of coun t r ies adopted independent ex- change rate policies when they in fo rmed the Fund t h at announced marg ins on the ir in te rven t ion currenc ies would not necessarily be ma in ta ined. These included Au s t r ia and Portugal (March 1973 ); Morocco (May 1973 ); Finland, Iceland, Ma lays ia, and Singapore ( J u ne 1973); Cyprus, N ew Z e a l a n d, a nd Y u g o s l a v ia ( J u ly 1 9 7 3 ); Greece (October 1973 ); Malawi (November 1 9 7 3 ); Sp a in ( J a n u a ry 1 9 7 4 ); a nd T u n i s ia (F eb ru a ry 1974 ). Most of the coun tr ies ( i n c l u d i ng most of the deve lop ing coun tr ies not men t ioned above) that use the French f ranc, pound s ter l ing, or the U.S. do l lar as t h e ir in t e rv en t ion cu r rency con t inue to do so w i th no change in the re la t ionsh ip between th e ir own cu r rency and the in te rven t ion cu r rency invo lved. However, some coun tr ies, e.g., Jama ica, repegged f rom s ter l ing to the U.S. dollar. In November the Execu t ive Directors of the Fund amended the decision on "Central Rates and W ider Marg ins: A Temporary Reg ime ."5 This decision was adopted by the Executive Directors in December 1971 in order to indicate practices th at membe rs m ight wish to follow in the then p reva i l ing c ircums tances consistently with A r t ic le IV, Section 4 ( #) and the Board of Gov- ernors Resolution No. 26-9, wh ich called on all membe rs to collaborate w i th the Fund and with each o ther in order to m a i n t a in a satisfactory s t ruc tu re of exchange rates w i t h in appropr ia te marg ins.

The e f fect of the am e n dm e nt was to b r ing the decision more in con fo rm i ty w i th present realities. Ma in ly, the changes in the decision accommoda te adher- ence to par va lues w i th ma rg ins m a i n t a i n ed on ly in relation to an in te rven t ion cu r rency or to cen- tral rates in te rms of an in te rven t ion cu r rency inc lud ing a floating cu r rency, and recognize the poss ib i l i ty of us ing mo re t h an one in te rven t ion cu r rency. In add i t ion, the am e n dm e nt revised the ear l ier decision w i th regard to mu l t ip le cu r rency practices and d i s c r im in a to ry cu r rency arrange- men ts by s t i p u l a t i ng t h at no m emb er sha ll pe rm i t, except as approved or au tho r ized u n d er A r t i- cle V I I I, Section 3, or A r t ic le XIV, Section 2, a d i f fe rence in excess of 2 per cent between any two buy ing or any two selling rates for spot exchange t ran sac t ions between i ts cu r rency and the currencies of other membe r s; or a spread in excess of 2 per cent be tween a buy ing and a selling ra te for spot exchange transac t ions be- tween its cu r r en cy and the cu r rency of ano ther member. Despite the flexible exchange ra te regime oper- ating in relation to the m a jor cu r renc ies, meas- ures to curb cap i tal inf lows, p a r t i cu l a r ly those on short-term f u n ds taken in 1971 and s t reng thened the rea f te r, were not relaxed in general u n t il a f t er m id-1973. The first re laxa t ion came a f ter a s t reng then ing of the U.S. do l lar against the ma jor European cu r renc ies in the th i rd qua r ter of the year. Then in late 1973 the rise in petroleum prices b rought the prospect of a drastic alteration of established global balance of paymen ts pat- terns. As a direct result of the rise in pe tro leum prices most if not all the indus t r ial coun tr ies were expected to incur substantial cu r rent account deficits in 1974. In late 1973 and ear ly 1974 there was a ma jor reversal in the application of measures to control capital flows. Whereas the Un i ted States elimi- nated its controls against capital outflows, most EEC countries and Japan d isman t led m any of the controls over inflows and in some coun tr ies borrowing abroad was encouraged. There was also in this period some t igh ten ing of the controls over capital outflows, especially by France, Italy, and Japan. In 1973 when subs tan t ial growth in the vo lume of world trade coincided w i th con t inu ing inf la- tionary pressures, many countries eased quan t i- tative and ta r i ff and other cost restrictions on impor ts. At the same time, instances mu l t ip l ied of indu s t r ial and p r ima ry producing countries reso r t ing to export taxa t ion and quota l im i ta t ion or ou t r ight proh ib i t ion of commod i ty exports in order to ensure su f f ic ient domestic supplies at reasonable prices. The changed expec ta t ions regard ing global bal- ance of paymen ts pa t te rns and the e f fect that the sha rp increase in pe t ro leum prices might have on world t r ade and p aym en ts cons t i tu ted a ma jor topic of discussion by the Comm i t tee of the Board of Governors of the In te rna t ional Mone ta ry Fund on R e fo rm of the In t e rn a t ion al Mone ta ry System and Re la ted Issues ( the Comm i t tee of Twen ty) wh i ch he ld its fifth mee t ing in Rome on Janu- ary 17 and 18, 1974. Following th at discussion the Execu t ive Board of the Fund adopted a deci- sion on J a n u a ry 24, 1974 th at reflects many of the concerns raised at the mee t ing of the Com- m i t t ee of Twen ty. This decision s ta ted: 1.

Acco rd ing ly, the Comm i t tee stressed the impor- tance of avo id ing compe t i t ive deprec ia t ion and the esca la t ion of res t r ic t ions on t rade and paymen t s; and emphas ized the impo r tance of p u r s u i ng policies that wou ld su s t a in app rop r ia te levels of economic ac t iv i ty and emp loymen t, wh i le m i n im i z i ng in f l a t ion. It was also recognized th at recent deve lopmen ts wou ld create serious p a ym e n ts d i f f i c u l t i es for many deve lop ing coun tr ies. The Comm i t tee agreed that there should be the closest i n t e r n a t i o n al cooperation and consulta- t ion in pu r su it of these objectives. 2.

Du r ing the period under review the Bahamas became a member of the Fund, raising total membe rsh ip to 126 coun tr ies.

This Report, and in par t icu lar the following sections, centers on exchange restrictions, but it also covers other measures and intergovernmental arrangements that may have direct balance of paymen ts implications. 5 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution R E PORT ON EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS II. Main Developments in Restrictive Practices 1. Trade and Paymen ts Res tr ic t ions In the period u n d er review, m a ny coun t r ies eased q u a n t i t a t i ve and cost res tr ic t ions on im- ports. At the same t ime, i n d u s t r i al and p r im a ry produc ing coun tr ies increas ing ly resorted to taxa- tion and quo ta l im i t a t ion or ou t r ight p roh ib i t ion of commod i ty expor ts in order to ensu re su f f i c i ent domestic supplies at reasonable prices. The most impo r t ant deve lopment of 1973 was the produc- tion cu tbacks and d i sc r im ina to ry export embar- goes imposed by most M idd le Eas tern oil pro- duc ing coun tr ies in October 1973. From 1972 to 1973, world p roduc t ion of c rude oil increased by an e s t ima ted 8 per cen t, and the v a lue of produc- tion more t h an doubled. Following the impo s i t ion of export re s t ra in ts in the M idd le East, a n um b er of o il impo r t ing coun t r ie s, in p a r t i c u l ar the m a jor i n d u s t r i al coun t r ies, took steps to p revent unde- sired exports or re-exports of c rude oil and pe tro leum p roduc ts to conserve domestic supp l ies. Soon these measures began to be followed in m any countries by res t r ic t ions on expor ts of pe tro leum-based fe r t i l ize r s, chem ica ls, and plastics. World-wide shortages of p ro te in meal and oil- seed led m a ny coun t r ies to impose or t igh ten export controls du r ing the first ha lf of 1973 on soybeans, cottonseed, rapeseed, copra, and va r i- ous de r iva t ives. Ou t r ight export proh ib i t ions, usu- ally of a tempo ra ry cha rac te r, were imposed in Brazil, Colombia, Greece, Ind ia, Indones ia, Paki- stan, Sri Lanka, the Sudan, and the Un i ted States. Later in the yea r, m any of these res tr ic t ions were eased, and those of the Un i ted States were l i f t ed on October 1, 1973. A numb er of coun t r ies in troduced or in tens i f ied export res tr ic t ions on a wide range of o ther ag r icu l tu ral p roduc ts such as cotton, gra ins, hides and sk ins, meat ( in p a r t i cu l ar b e e f ), and sugar. Expo rt res t r ic t ions also a f fec ted a numb er of o ther basic commod i t ies such as iron and steel scrap, lead, mangane se ore, n a t u r al rub- ber, t in, and z inc. a. Restrictions on Imports and Import Payments The indu s t r ia l ized and the more developed pri- m a ry p roduc ing coun t r ies con t inu ed to re lax th e ir r em a i n i ng res t r ic t ions on impo r t s. In i t i a l ly, w i th an easing of ba lance of paymen ts pressures, m a ny developing countries also reduced reliance on ex te rnal res t r ic t ions. Toward the end of the year, however, the ac tual or an t ic ipa ted ba lance of 6 paymen ts impact of the oil price increases began to be reflected in a reversal of this trend. Among coun t r ies with a high degree of liberali- za t ion, Japan increased impo rt quotas for the r em a i n i ng restricted commod i t ies by 30 per cent over fiscal year 1972 or to 8 per cent of domestic consump t ion of these commod i t ies, wh ichever was larger.

In March most foreign exchange paymen ts of the Gove rnment prev ious ly settled at the official rate were sh i f ted to the free ma rket rate. A rgen t ina adjusted the exchange rate for non t rad i t ional exports by chang ing the propor t ion of fore ign exchange that could be sold in the commercial and f inanc ial ma rke ts, an ad ju s tm ent equ iva lent to an 8.4 per cent depreciation in te rms of the U.S. dollar. For t rad i t ional exports, however, the rate rema ined unchanged in te rms of the U.S. dol- lar. In Ju ly 1973, Bangladesh ex tended the p rem ium paymen ts scheme for personal inwa rd rem i t tances in conver t ib le currenc ies for ano ther year, and e f fec t ive f rom Ju ly u n t il J u ne 1974, gave expor ters a cash subsidy for most exports amoun t ing to 30 per cent of the va lue of exports. Chile reorganized its exchange system in Ju ly 1973 by merg ing the b a n k i ng and the brokers' ma rke ts and reduc ing the basic exchange rates to seven. However, on September 30 the b a n k i ng and brokers' ma rke ts were re-es tab l ished. In the bank ing ma rke t, through wh ich pass a ll t rade and t rade - re la ted t ransac t ions, capital movemen t s, and most services, a u n i f o rm exchange ra te was set, except for proceeds f rom copper expor ts, which are converted at a h igher rate for Ch i lean escudos in terms of U.S. dollars. In the brokers' ma rke t, th rough wh ich exchange for tou r i sm, travel exp end i tu r e s, and a few o ther t ran sac t ions in invisibles are se t t led, a u n i f o rm ra te was also in t roduced. Subsequen t ly, these th ree ra tes were changed several t imes and the spread between the b ank ing m a rk et and the brokers' ma rket was reduced; in add i t ion the pr inc ipal tax on transac- tions in the brokers' ma rket was reduced f rom 50 per cent to 10 per cen t. In J a n u a ry 1973 Costa Rica fixed the se l l ing ra te in the o f f ic ial ma rket at <t 6.68 per US$1, and the buy ing rate in the f ree m a rk et at # 8.54 per US$1. Du r ing the year the propor t ion of export proceeds wh ich could be sold in the f ree m a rk et was ex tended several t imes. Egypt reorganized and expanded a parallel exchange ma rket w i th e f fect f rom Sep tember 1. Dealings in the para l lel ma rket were restricted to the commerc ial bank s; transac t ions covering most inv i s ib le i tems and some me rchand ise exports, as well as specified merchand ise imports, could take place at rates based on the official rates w i th a p r em i um of 50 per cent (buy ing) and 55 per cent ( s e l l i n g ). Following the deprec ia t ion of the basic exchange ra te in Augus t, the Khmer Repub- lic did not allow the p re fe ren t ial rate for the riel to dev ia te by more t h an 20 per cent f rom the basic ra te. W i th a f u r t h er depreciation of the riel in October, th is marg in was reduced to KR 45 per US$1 or 16.4 per cent. In March 1973, Laos in t roduced a comb ina t ion of exchange bonus and export taxes for t imber exports, resu l t ing in an add i t ional e f f e c t ive exchange rate, and in Ju ly the impo rt i tems eligible for f inanc ing at the pref- e r en t i al ra te of K 600 per US$1 were sha rp ly reduced. Morocco in t roduced a 5 per cent bonus in Ju ly payab le on the d i rh am equ iva lent of for- eign cu r renc ies repa tr ia ted by means of bank or postal t r a n s f e rs by Moroccans work ing abroad. Nepal fo rm a l i z ed the t r an s f e rs of exporters' exchange e n t i t l em e n ts in Ap r i l, thus giving legal fo rm to a complex system of multiple exchange rates. In Feb rua ry 1973 Venezue la altered the rates at w h i ch the Cen t ral Bank purchases proceeds of cacao, coffee, iron ore, and pe t ro leum, and sells fo re ign exchange to the Gov e rnm en t, i ts agencies, and to comme rc ial b ank s; the rates at which com- me rc ial banks buy and sell fo re ign exchange were also mod i f i ed. The changes were designed to apprec ia te the bo l ivar in te rms of the U.S. dollar fo l low ing the announced deva lua t ion of the U.S. do l la r. On the other hand, the Ph i l ipp ines abo l ished the s tab i l iza t ion tax on proceeds f rom the expor ts of cer ta in commodities and replaced it w i th a cus toms d u ty on the va lue of exports.

Import Deposits, Import Surcharges, and Measures to S t imu la te Exports a. Advance Import Deposits A number of countries abolished advance import deposits, while others eased the requ i remen ts for import deposits by lowering the rates applied or by narrowing their scope. In Ecuador, the prior import deposit requirement was abolished. El Salvador exempted imports of raw ma ter ia ls for indus try f rom the 100 per cent import deposit required for imports f rom countries outside the Central American Common Market th at apply discriminatory restrictions against its exports. Israel reduced deposit requirements and then abolished them on Janua ry 1, 1974. U ruguay exempted imports of preferred capital goods f rom special import deposits, and extended the scope 10 of impo r ts f ree of advance deposits. Import deposit ra tes were also reduced in Greece, Indo- ne s ia, and Tu rkey. In May 1973, Colombia introduced a supple- m e n t a ry impo rt deposit requ i rement and subse- q u e n t l y, th roughout the year, made f u r t h er changes in bo th the ra tes of deposit and the ir coverages; impo r ts f r om o ther member coun tr ies of the And e an G roup were exemp ted f rom advance deposits. Ch i le ex tended the app l ica t ion of the 10,000 per cent advance impo rt deposit to add i t ion al im p o r t s; in e a r ly 1974, however, the coverage was reduced to a few i tems classified as l u x u r i e s. Viet-Nam es tab l ished impo rt deposit r e q u i r em e n ts at v a ry ing ra tes on specified com- mod i t ies for impo r ts f inanced f rom i ts fore ign exchange reserves. The deposit r e q u i r em e nt for impo r ts und er the Commerc ial Impo rt Program (C I P) was raised f rom VN$30 per US$1 for a th r e e -mon th period to VN$100 per US$1 for six mon th s.

In the Dom in ican Republic, impo r ts subject to a fu l ly prepa id le t ter of cred it were exemp ted f rom the p r ep aym ent of 80 per cent of du t ies and sur- charges. Panama removed the import tax of 6 per cent f rom goods exempt f rom impo rt du ty, and Pa raguay reduced by 50 per cent the sur- charge applied to certain impor ts. The Bahamas increased the "emergency tax" on im p o r ts f r om 7Y2 per cent to l2l/2 per cent. Ecuador imposed a surcharge of 1 per cent on impor ts of essential and semiessential goods, and of 6 per cent on less essential and luxu ry goods to compensate for the loss of revenue resu l t ing f rom the abolition of the exchange tax on f ree ma rket transac t ions. In Israel the tem- porary impo rt surcharge was increased from 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the c.i.f. value of impor ts on November 5, 1973 and extended un t il Ma rch 1974. Pakistan introduced a flood relief surcharge of 25 per cent on most imports from September 15.

In pa r t icu la r, a wide va r ie ty of measures were taken in fields of export c red it or exchange risk fac i l i t ies, on ly a few of wh ich are ind ica ted below. A numb er of coun t r ies offered assistance to exporters by in t roduc ing or supp lemen t ing special credit fac i l i t ies for exports, gua ran tees against exchange risks, and o ther measures designed to in f luence export credit te rm s. Indu s t r i al coun tr ies already possessing comp rehens ive gua ran tee sys- tems ex tended the cover prov ided to exporters. In France, the Compagnie Frangaise d'Assurance pour le Commerce Ex te r ieur (CO FAC E) ex tended the exchange r a te gua ran tee for expor ters to cover con trac ts w i th te rms over one year ( f o rm e r ly two y e a r s ). Beg inn ing J a n u a ry 1, 1973, the Ge rman Bunde sbank o f fe red ce r ta in exchange risk fac i l i- ties to expor ters of goods and ce r ta in services in respect of fo rwa rd p a ym e n ts for 3 to 24 mon ths, but th is f a c i l i ty was d iscon t inued some mon ths la te r. Japan resumed the export f inanc ing scheme wh ich had been t e rm in a t ed in 1972 in order to allow small Japanese firms to cover the ir fo rwa rd exchange transac t ions. The Ne the r lands estab- lished a gua ran tee system for exporters to cover exchange risks in respect of capital goods trans- actions with a l i fe of two years or more. Spain in t roduced a new in su rance program for export- ers' exchange risks to be operated by the Exports Credit In su r an ce Company. It was also announced that expor ters and impor ters wou ld be compen- sated for losses caused by the deva lua t ion of the peseta in 1967 and the r ev a lu a t ions in 1971 and 1973. In the Un i ted K ingdom, the Expo rt Cred i ts Gua ran tee D ep a r tm ent (ECGD) o f fe red increased credit insu rance cover, and w idened financial fac i l i t ies for expor ters' subcon t rac ts placed in member coun t r ies of the EEC. Peru allowed expo r t ing firms to use exchange cer t if ica tes earned as en t i t l em en ts for the payment of in te rest on foreign borrowings. Sri Lanka extended the coverage of the Conver t ib le Rupee Accounts, a currency retention and utilization scheme for exporters. Several coun tr ies granted concessions for exports in the form of tax rebates, tax credit arrangemen ts, and tax exemptions. Export taxes on some commod i t ies were e l im ina ted in Argen- t ina, India, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uruguay or reduced in Ecuador and India to encourage the production and export of specific commodities. Chile suspended the application of all export subsidies. Indonesia exemp ted add i t ional export goods f rom the 10 per cent exchange tax. Mexico increased the special tax rebate on exports of m a n u f a c t u r ed goods f rom 10 per cent to 14 per cen t. Israel increased tax incen t ives for exports on two occasions in 1973. On the o ther hand, taxes on specific export i tems were in t roduced in Aus t r ia, Ind ia, Laos, N icaragua, Pak i s tan, and the Ph i l ipp ines or increased by B raz i l, Guy an a, Ind ia, Pak is tan, and the Ph i l ipp ines. 4.

The agreements between the Syr ian A rab Republic and Spain, Yugoslavia, and Ind ia, and be tween Greece and Brazil were also abolished. Thus at least nine agreements be tween Fund members were te rm ina ted, and the total number of operative bilateral payments agreemen ts between Fund members now stands at about 60. Member coun t r ies also made progress in ter- m in a t ing b i la te ral paymen ts agreements w i th non- membe rs, but the total number of such agreements ( a b o ut 200) rema ins considerable. Austria, D e nm a r k, Ice land, No rway, and Sweden a ll e l im i- na ted t h e ir a r r ang em en ts w i th Eas tern G e rm a n y; for all but Iceland th is represented the final step in abo l ish ing th e ir r em a i n i ng paymen ts agree- m en t s.

Measu res A f f e c t ing Cap i tal The period und er rev iew aga in witnessed large- scale resort to mea su res to in f lu en ce the d i rec t ion and size of cap i tal movemen t s, by the developed coun t r ies as we ll as by m a ny deve lop ing coun- t r ie s. C o n t i n u i ng a t rend t h at had become pro- nounced in 1971, m a ny of these ac t ions aga in we re des igned at f irst to i n f l u e n ce i n f l ows of cap i- tal or to i n d u ce ou t f low s, but a sh a rp reversal occurred in the last q u a r t er of 1973 and the ea r ly m o n t hs of 1974. There was w idespread resort to direct and ind i rect controls on b a n ks and nonb ank f inanc ial i n s t i t u t i o ns and a v a r i e ty of techn iques were employed, in c lud ing selective reserve r e q u i r em e n ts against ex te rnal l i a b i l i t i e s, l im i t a t i o ns on banks' net fo re ign positions, and res tr ic t ions on the acceptance of non res ident deposits and p aym ent of in te rest on fore ign f u n d s. In add i t ion, m a ny coun t r ies con t inued to apply measures a f fec t ing the te rms and cost of foreign borrowing, pa r t icu la r ly by nonbank s, such as m and a to ry deposit requ i remen t s. The use of these var ious controls outside Europe and Japan was rare. In add i t ion to th e ir ba lance of pay- men ts effec ts, measures a f fec t ing direct and port- fo l io inves tmen t, both inward and ou tward, the terms of p aym ent for t rade t ransac t ions, and per- sonal capital t ran s fe r s, continued to be used as i n s t r um e n ts to achieve domestic policy objectives. Du r ing the period und er review, the vo lume of t ransac t ions in the Euro-currency marke ts con- t inued to increase. Ac t iv i ty in med ium - te rm syn- dicated bank loans grew pa r t icu la r ly fas t, wh i le Euro-bond issues slowed down. Developing coun- tries were increas ing ly successful in tapp ing the resources of the Euro-currency marke ts. With the f inanc ing problems ar is ing f rom the petroleum supply situation, access to the Euro-currency and Euro-bond ma rke ts has assumed increased impor- tance. Certain oil producing nations and nations receiving oil f u n ds for on-lending have already indicated their willingness to increase their lending abroad, through bond issues or otherwise; these include Iran, Kuwa i t, Lebanon, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela. Some oil impor t ing countries have expressed the intention to rely 12 inc rea s ing ly on fore ign borrow ing to ease the ir reserve s t r a in s; they inc lude France, Greece, Italy, Spain, and the Un i ted K ingdom. In Eu ropean coun t r ies in the ear ly mon ths of 1973 th e re was a w idesp read t igh ten ing of meas- ures to c u rb capital inf lows, pa r t icu la r ly those of shor t- term f u n d s, but in m a ny cases bear ing on med ium - te rm and long-term flows as well. They inc luded the erection of an e labora te set of con- trols in two of the coun t r ies prev ious ly v i r t u a l ly w i t h o ut t r a n s f er or t r an s a c t ion con tro ls, G e rm any and Sw i tze r land. In the t h i rd qu a r t er of 1973 policy changes in the d irec t ion of a relaxation of the measures p rev iou s ly adopted became appar- en t, beg inn ing in France and c u lm i n a t i ng in the d i sm an t l ing of many, but not all, such controls in Wes te rn Eu ropean coun t r ies in J a n u a ry and Feb rua ry 1974. The reversal in policy toward cap i tal inf lows was man i fe s ted most clearly in con tro ls applied in the domestic b ank ing system. The n um b er of coun t r ies app ly ing selective reserve r e q u i r em e n ts at first inc reased, as did the comp lex i ty of such requ i remen t s. Among the coun t r ies wh ich in t roduced or t igh tened provi- sions with respect to average or marg inal reserve r equ i r em en ts against banks' ex te rnal liabilities were Luxembou rg ( J a n u a r y ), Spain (F e b r u a r y ), Belgium-Luxembourg, France, the Ne ther lands (M a r c h ), and Switzerland (March and Novem- b e r ). Between May and October G e rm any tight- ened reserve requ i remen ts on nonres ident deposits by repealing cer ta in exemp t ions and reducing the reference level for the calculation of the growth of banks' foreign liabilities. France abolished reserve requ i remen ts against increases in non- resident f r a nc deposits in October, and those on the level of such deposits in Janua ry 1974. In J a n u a ry and February 1974 a number of the other countries which earlier had tightened reserve requ i remen ts either reduced or removed th em, e.g., Belgium-Luxembourg and Germany. The number of countries prohibiting the pay- ment of interest, or imposing "commission charges" or negative interest rates on the holding of non res ident deposits exhibited a pa t te rn simi- lar to that shown w i th regard to reserve require- ments as an indirect control on the banking system. Belgium and Luxembourg in April intro- duced a "special commission" of 1A of 1 per cent a week on nonresident holdings of Belgian f r an cs in Convertible Accounts that exceeded the daily average for the last quarter of 1972. The measure was suspended with effect f rom August 1, ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution M A IN D E V E L O PM E N TS IN R E S T R I C T I VE PRACT ICES but was re in t roduced at the end of September, on a modified basis, in order to ward off f u r t h er speculative in f lows of cap i tal in the wake of the appreciation of the Netherlands gu i lder. The measure was again suspended in J a n u a ry 1974. In March, France p roh ib i ted in te re st p a ym e n ts on non re s ident f r a nc deposits of less t h an 180 days' m a t u r i ty and in Apr il the banks on the ir own i n i t i a t i ve in t roduced an in terest charge of % of 1 per cent a mon th on increases over the level of J a n u a ry 4, 1973 in ba lances on Foreign Accounts and F in an c i al Accoun ts. The in te rest charge was removed in October when the pro- hibition on in te rest p a ym e n ts was e l im in a t ed. In Switzerland, the ru les gove rn ing p a ym e nt of the negative in te rest ra te of 2 per cent a q u a r t er on foreign-held bank deposits in Swiss f r a n cs were made more s t r ingent f rom March to Jun e, and again f rom J u ly to September, when the nega t ive interest rate was suspended. Banks and au thor- ized depositories in the N e t h e r l a n ds were d irec ted in March 1973 to charge a special commission initially of 1A of 1 per cent a week on increases on balances in most Convertible Gu i lder Accounts over the average c red it balance du r ing Febru- ary 1-14, 1973. The comm iss ion was reduced to zero in May but the p roh ib i t ion on in terest paymen ts rema ined in effec t. Israel applied a negative in terest rate on specified fo re ign cur- rency deposits of non res iden ts between April 1973 and J a n u a ry 1974. Proh ib i t ions on the payment of interest on specified ex te rnal l iab i l i t ies of banks continued in force in Ge rmany, the Ne the r lands, and Spain. Suppor t ing the controls over payment of in ter- est on nonres ident deposits, a number of coun tr ies introduced direct res tr ic t ions of various k inds on banks, including v i r tual prohibitions on the acceptance of nonres ident deposits, the temporary inconvertibility of new nonresident deposits, and limitations on banks' net foreign positions, but most were relaxed late in 1973 or early in 1974. Many of the ind irect controls on nonbanks were intended to reduce the attractiveness of foreign borrowing by requ i r ing domestic cu r rency depos- its, often noninterest-bearing, against such bor- rowing. At times, these measures covered banks and nonbanks, but they were usua l ly addressed to the latter. European countries app ly ing deposit requ iremen ts against inflows of capital included Germany, Ireland, Spain, Turkey, and Yugoslavia and outside Europe th is techn ique was employed in Australia and Brazil. Con tro ls of a d irect or q u a n t i t a t i ve measure to l im it in f lows of cap i tal re su l t ing f rom inwa rd d i rect i n v e s tm e nt or the acqu is i t ion of domestic securities or real estate by nonresidents were app l ied by A u s t r i a, G e rm a n y, and Sw i tzer land, among o thers. On the o th er h a nd several coun t r ie s, some of w h i ch had e a r l i er t ak en steps to cu rb capital in f low s, took measu res to s t im u l a te cap i tal in f lows or d iscourage cap i tal ou t f lows. I t a ly in t roduced in J u ly a 50 per cent in t e r e s t - f r ee depos it requ i re- m e nt aga inst ou twa rd cap i tal t r a n s f e rs for d irect inv e s tm en t s, po r t fo l io inv e s tm en t s, f inanc ial loans, pu rchases of real estate, and personal cap i tal mov em en t s. The deposit ra te was 25 per cent or zero on i n v e s tm e nt f u nd securities depend ing on w h e t h er the i n v e s tm e nt f u nd had inves ted at least 50 per cent or all of its po r t fo l io in I t a l i an securi- t ies; exemp t ions were also g ran ted on m a ny direct i n v e s tm e n ts and on bond p lacemen ts by ce r ta in EEC agencies. I ta ly and the Un i t ed K ingdom th roughout the period u n d er review resorted to large-scale pub l ic sector bo r row ing abroad, and France followed ear ly in 1974. Denma rk reduced its pub l ic sector bo r row ing abroad f rom 1972 levels. Moreover, in September 1973 France ter- m i n a t ed the de facto p roh ib i t ion on borrow ing abroad for the financing of inwa rd and ou tward direct inv e s tm ent and in J a n u a ry 1974 prohibited f r a nc lend ing to non res iden ts and allowed foreign c u r r e n cy borrow ing up to F 10 m i l l ion by non- b ank res iden ts. In March 1973 the Un i ted King- dom re in t roduced exchange cover fac i l i t ies for fo re ign cu r rency borrow ing by ce r ta in public sec- tor bodies. A l though in i t ia l ly available only for borrow ing in U.S. dollars, it was la ter ex tended to ce r ta in o ther currenc ies. In the case of the p r iva te sector, but not the public sector, the m in i- mum period for foreign currency borrowing for most domestic uses was reduced. Among the European countries, measures toward liberalization of capital outflows were m inor a f t er the beg inn ing of 1973. Denmark, I re land, and the United Kingdom had taken vari- ous measures of th is k ind either upon their accession to the EEC on Janua ry 1, 1973 or sho r t ly before. In May, the United Kingdom eased the restrictions on s ter l ing financing of non- resident-controlled U.K. companies and branches. In Augus t, a series of measures was announced in France wh ich dismantled or relaxed most of the rema in ing exchange restriction on capital out- flows introduced in 1968 and 1969, but several 13 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution R E PORT ON EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS of the old controls were restored in J a n u a ry 1974 when France in add i t ion prohibited v i r tu a l ly all lend ing in f r an cs to non res iden ts. Some re laxa t ion of the very restrictive controls over outward port- fo l io inve s tment took place in F in l and and Spain.

Japan u n t il October 1973 m a i n t a i n ed va r ious regu la t ions and gu id an ce m e a su r es des igned to discourage cap i tal in f lows and encourage ou t f low s. Measures f avo r ing the pa r t ic ipa t ion of Japanese banks and i n s t i t u t i o n al inves to rs in f i n a n c i al ma r- kets overseas also con t inued, as did measures f a c i l i t a t i ng ou twa rd d i rect i n v e s tm e n t. In Novem- ber and December a n um b er of the ea r l ier meas- ures were reversed or weakened. Thus the pro- h i b i t i on on any net non r e s id ent i n v e s tm e nt in Japanese secu r i t ies was l i f t e d, non re s iden t s' acqu i- s i t ions of ba lances in Free Yen Accoun ts were f a c i l i t a t e d, and re s iden t s' i n v e s tm e nt in fo re ign sho r t - te rm securities was made sub ject to case-by- case screen ing.

J a p an also discouraged ce r ta in types of ou twa rd i n v e s tm e n t s, p a r t i c u l a r ly in secu r i t ie s, real estate, and less essen t ial services. The Un i t ed States took a n um b er of mea su res in 1973 to re lax its con tro ls on cap i tal ou t f low s. In c o n j u n c t i on w i th dome s t ic m o n e t a ry po l icy measu res, the U n i t ed States in J u ne 1973 reduced f rom 20 per cent to 8 per cent the reserve m i n i- mum to be he ld by Federal Reserve m emb er b a n ks aga inst Eu ro -do l l ar bo r row ings in excess of amoun ts p e rm i t t ed as a re se rve - f ree base. Such reserve-free bases were to be e l im i n a t ed g r a d u a l l y. Also, in J u ne the Federal Reserve Board reques ted U.S. agenc ies, b ranches, and n o nm em b er bank subs id iar ies of fo re ign b anks to observe vo lun- t a r i ly the same m a r g i n al r e q u i r em e nt on new borrow ings app l icab le to domestic banks. 14 In May 1973 the Office of Direct Inves tmen ts in t roduced amendmen ts to the Foreign Direct Inv e s tm ent Program (FD1P), re t roac t ive to Janu- ary 1, 1973, subs tan t ia l ly improving benefits for d i rect inves to rs selling equ i ty securities abroad for cash or exchang ing them for the stock or assets of a foreign company held by a large n um b er of fo re ign na t iona ls. In Ju ly 1973 the U.S. Federal Reserve V o l u n t a ry Foreign Cred it Re s t ra int Pro- gram (VFCRP) was extended by a request to U.S. agencies and b ranches of fo re ign banks that held US$1 m i l l ion or more in fo re ign assets to observe specific fo re ign lend ing ceilings. Previ- ous ly these i n s t i t u t i o ns had been asked s imp ly to act in con fo rm i ty w i th in the spirit of the VFCRP gu id e l in e s. Am e n dm e n ts to the regu la t ions und er the FDIP in J u ly and again in November eased the year-end comp l iance r equ i r em en t s, inc lud ing an increase in the "earnings allowable" from 40 per cent to 60 per cent of 1972 or 1973 a f f i l i a t ed fo re ign na t ional ea rn ings (p rev ious ly based exc lu s ive ly on the prev ious year's earn ings), and a r e l ax a t ion in the con tro ls cove r ing the m in i- mum allowable investment by small direct inves- tors. The m i n im um world-wide allowable was raised f r om US$6 m i l l ion to US$10 m i l l ion.

Subsequen t ly, on J a n u a ry 29, 1974, the IET was reduced to zero, e f f e c t i ve the same d ay. New gu ide l ines u n d er the VFCRP inc luded increases in the ce i l ings on for- e ign loans by commerc ial banks and by U.S. agencies and b ranches of fore ign banks, and e l im i n a t ed the request th at b anks r e f r a in f rom m a k i ng nonexpe rt loans w i th ma tu r i t ies of over one year to res iden ts of the developed coun tr ies of We s te rn Europe, as well as the r e s t r a int against te rm loans to these coun tr ies by U.S. agencies and b r a n c h es of f o r e i gn b ank s.

Executive Board Decision No. 3463-(71 /126), December 18, 1971, as amended by Decision No. 4083-(73/104), November 7, 1973 20 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution P A RT II ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution This page intentionally left blank ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Explanatory Note to Country Surveys In Part II, individual surveys of the exchange systems of the member countries of the Fund, including three nonmetropolitan territories, are given. The exchange system of one other country which was not a member of the Fund at the time this Report was written is also described. In general, the surveys relate to the exchange systems as at the end of 1973. For a few countries the surveys relate to the exchange systems at a later date or include references to significant developments which took place early in 1974. The description of an exchange system is not necessarily confined to those aspects involving exchange restrictions or exchange controls. As in previous Reports, questions of definition and jurisdiction have not been raised, and an attempt has been made to describe restrictive systems in their entirety, except for the tariff structure and, in most cases, direct taxes on exports and imports. Thus, the surveys include references to such features as import licensing, advance deposit requirements, import surcharges, travel taxes, export licensing, and export incentive schemes. Similarly, the section "Changes during 1973" may include references to certain develop- ments that have a direct impact on international transactions but are not reflected in the body of the survey, such as major revisions of import tariffs or developments relating to regional cooperation. A standardized framework has been employed in drafting the surveys: each system is described under similar headings, and each country survey contains a final section that lists chronologically the more significant changes which took place in the restrictive system during 1973. An indication of the subject matter to be found under these headings is given in the following paragraphs. Under Exchange Rate System, the par value and /or the central rate and /or the official exchange rates are given, usually in terms of SDRs, gold, and U.S. dollars, together with a reference to other rates which may be essential to the country's exchange rate system. In the surveys of certain countries with multiple exchange rate systems, further details are given in a Table of Exchange Rates (see below). The rates quoted are those effective on December 31, 1973, unless stated otherwise. Under Exchange Control Territory, the extent of applicability of the exchange control is explained when it covers two or more sovereign or autonomous territories whose residents have common rights and obligations under the exchange control regulations. Under Administration of Control, some indication is given of the authorities responsible for policy and administration of the controls and of the extent to which their powers are delegated for practical working purposes. Under Prescription of Currency, the requirements affecting the selection of the currency and method of settlement for transactions with other countries are described. Where a country has concluded payments agreements with other countries, the terms of these agreements often lead to prescription of the currency for specified categories of payments to and from the countries concerned. The countries with which bilateral payments agreements are in force are listed either in the text or in a footnote. For a country whose currency has international importance, the prescription of currency arrangements involve the use of its own currency held by nonresidents in accounts with authorized banks. Payments to and from such nonresident accounts are then regarded as equivalent to settlements in foreign currency. Under Nonresident Accounts, an indication is given of the manner in which the country regards the accounts in its currency of account holders not regarded as resident in that country, and the facilities and limitations attached to such accounts. Where there is more than one type of nonresident account, the nature and operation of the various types are described. Under Imports and Import Payments, import licensing requirements are described briefly, and details are given of the additional requirements imposed on payments for imports and of any advance deposit requirements. The term "open general license" indicates arrangements whereby certain imports or other international transactions are exempt from the restrictive application of licensing requirements, in contrast to an individual license," which may be either given freely, or restricted in its issue, according to administrative decisions. The expression "global quota" is employed to indicate quotas that are not necessarily universal in their application but instead may apply to a group of countries, e.g., global quotas for imports from countries in the European Economic Community. 23 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Explanatory Note to Country Surveys Under Payments for Invisibles, action in the matter of permitting payments abroad for current transactions in invisibles is described briefly, together with any limitations on the export of foreign and domestic banknotes. For some countries that do not impose limitations on payments for invisibles, this section is combined with the section on Proceeds from Invisibles (see below). Under Exports and Export Proceeds, the application of export licensing, where this is operative, is indicated, together with a brief outline of the requirements imposed on the proceeds derived from exports. The expression "exchange receipts must be surrendered" indicates that the recipient is required by the regulations to sell his foreign exchange against local currency, usually at the official rate, to the central bank or to a commercial bank or exchange dealer authorized for this purpose. In some countries there is a requirement that the exchange be sold in a free market. Under Proceeds from Invisibles, any conditions governing exchange derived from transactions in invisibles are given, and any limitations on the import of foreign and domestic banknotes are described. Under Capital, a general indication of the special arrangements or limitations attached to international receipts and payments in respect of capital items is given. Where special arrange- ments for foreign capital also cover the income thereon, they are usually dealt with in this section rather than in the sections on Payments for Invisibles and Proceeds from Invisibles. Under Gold, the principal provisions are summarized that govern the holding, negotiation, and import and export of gold coins and gold in other forms. In the Table of Exchange Rates, which is provided for certain countries having a multiple currency practice involving more than two rate levels, the exchange rates effective on a specified date are given. For convenience, the data in these tables are in terms of local currency units per U.S. dollar. The tables include effective rates arising from the negotiation of percentages of the total exchange at different rates, the imposition of exchange taxes, the negotiation of exchange certificates, etc. Under Changes during 1973, the more significant changes in the country's exchange and trade system during 1973 are presented in chronological order. Important measures made effective in the early months of 1974 are indicated in certain surveys in footnotes to the text. The individual country surveys were prepared by the staff of the Fund and reviewed by the authorities of the countries concerned. Preparation of this part of the Report was under the general direction of Mr. J. H. C. de Looper, Chief, Exchange Restrictions Division. 24 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution AFGHANISTAN Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.0197482 gram of fine gold per Afghani, corresponding to Af 45 = SDR 1. No exchange transactions take place at the par value. The Afghanistan Bank (the central bank) charges commissions ranging from l/i0 of 1 per cent to AFGHANISTAN through the banking system. A deposit of 100 per cent of the value of the imports in afghanis calculated at the prevailing free market rate, or in foreign exchange, is required upon establishment of a letter of credit. Such deposits may be used as collateral to obtain loans from commercial banks. The Afghanistan Bank is authorized to refuse to sell foreign ex- change for the importation of a group of consumer goods that are regarded as nonessential. However, exchange for these items may be purchased either from the commercial banks or in the bazaar. Payments for Invisibles Central government payments for foreign debt service and certain other invisibles are made at the official rate. All other payments are settled at free market rates. Travelers are not allowed to take out more than Af 500 in domestic banknotes. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports are not subject to license. Exports of a few com- modities (e.g., opium and museum pieces) are prohibited. Otherwise, control is exercised only over exports to bilateral agreement countries (see section on Imports and Import Pay- ments, above). Karakul is not exported to payments agree- ment countries. Exchange receipts from exports of karakul, wool, and cot- ton must be surrendered at the appropriate exchange rate (see section on Exchange Rate System, above). The net proceeds of all other exports must either be sold at free market rates to a domestic bank or be used by the exporter or a third party to pay for imports. Proceeds from Invisibles Forty per cent of the foreign currency salaries of foreign employees of the Afghan public and private sectors must be converted into afghanis at the official rate, but the remaining 60 per cent may be remitted abroad or exchanged at the free market rate. Except in the case of India, receipts over bilateral payments agreement accounts from the embassies and state trading organizations of the countries concerned for their local expenses in Afghanistan are converted at the official rate. All other receipts from invisibles are sold at free market rates through either the banks or the bazaar. Travelers enter- ing Afghanistan may not bring in more than Af 500 in Af- ghan banknotes. Capital Foreign investment in Afghanistan requires prior approval and is administered, as is domestic private investment, by an Investment Committee composed of five cabinet ministers. The Foreign and Domestic Private Investment Law (Febru- ary 10,1967) provides for a number of benefits, which include (1) income tax exemption for five years, beginning from the date of the first sales of products resulting from the new investment; (2) exemption from import duties on essential imports for five consecutive years after approval of the invest- ment; (3) exemption from taxes on dividends for five years 26 after the first distribution of dividends, but not more than eight years after the approval of the investment; (4) exemp- tion from personal income tax and corporate tax on interest on foreign loans which constitute part of an approved invest- ment; (5) exemption from export duties for ten years after the approval of the investment; and (6) mandatory purchases by government agencies and departments of their requirements from enterprises established under the law where such prod- ucts are substantially competitive with imports in price and quality. The law also establishes that an investment approved by the Investment Committee shall require no further license to operate in Afghanistan. Principal and interest installments on loans from abroad may be remitted freely to the extent of the legal obligation involved. Profits may be repatriated freely, and capital may be repatriated after five years at an annual rate not exceeding 25 per cent of the total registered capital. All the foregoing transfers are made through the free market. Joint ventures of foreign and Afghan capital are encouraged, but no specific percentages of domestic participation are prescribed and 100 per cent foreign-owned investments are not precluded by law. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell domestically gold in any form in Afghanistan. Imports of gold are re- stricted. Exports of gold and silver in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Council of Ministers; such licenses are not normally granted except for exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. Commercial exports of gold and silver jewelry and of other articles containing minor quantities of gold or silver do not require a license and may be made freely. Customs duties are payable on imports and exports of silver in any form unless the import or export is made by or on behalf of the monetary authorities. The import duty on gold is 1 per cent. Changes during 1973 February 13. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the official rate for the U.S. dollar was maintained unchanged at Af 45 = US$1. February 25. The bilateral payments agreement with Bul- garia was terminated. Henceforth all settlements took place in convertible currencies. March 21. The surrender rate for proceeds from karakul exports was changed from Af 65 per US$1 (official rate plus exchange subsidy of Af 20 per US$1) to either Af 75 per US$1 or the free market rate if lower than Af 75. The surrender rate for proceeds from wool exports to the convertible currency area was changed from Af 55 (official rate plus exchange subsidy of Af 10 per US$1) to Af 65 per US$1. The surrender rate for proceeds from wool exports to bilateral markets was changed from Af 45 to Af 55 per US$1 through the introduction of an exchange subsidy of Af 10 per agreement dollar. The surrender rate for cotton exports to bilateral markets remained unchanged at Af 52 per US$1 and that for cotton exports to multilateral markets remained at Af 70 per US$1. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution All foreign exchange payments of the Government previ- ously settled at the official rate were shifted to the free market fate* with the exception of debt servicing, contributions to international organizations, salaries of foreign experts, and the foreign exchange needs of Afghan embassies and missions abroad. As a result, the Government ceased to make ex- change for imports available at the official rate. April 9. The Afghanistan Bank's selling rate for clearing dollars under the payments agreements with Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia was raised from Af 65.50 to Af 70.50 per US$1. May 24. The bilateral payments agreement with Poland was terminated. Henceforth all settlements were made in con- vertible currencies. July 9. The Afghanistan Bank's selling rate for Chinese dcaring sterling (the People's Republic of China) was re- duced from Af 221.50 to Af 211.50 per £ stg. 1. July 16. The surrender rates for proceeds from exports of the remainder of the 1972/73 cotton crop were changed. For exports to the convertible currency area the rate was changed from Af 70 per US$1 (official rate plus exchange subsidy of Af 25 per US$1) to either Af 70 per US$1 or the free rate, whichever was lower. For exports to bilateral markets, the surrender rate was changed from Af 52 to Af 60 per US$1 through an increase in the exchange subsidy from Af 7 to Af 15 per agreement dollar. The surrender rate for proceeds from wool exports to bilat- eral markets was changed from Af 55 to Af 60 per US$1 through an increase in the exchange subsidy from Af 10 to Af 15 per agreement dollar. AFGHANISTAN July 20. Residents' access to the free market for certain current payments and certain outward capital transfers was restricted. A limit was imposed on the amount of foreign banknotes that travelers were allowed to take out without central bank permission; this limit was the equivalent of US$50 a person a trip. August 18. The Afghanistan Bank's selling rate for Chinese clearing sterling (the People's Republic of China) was re- duced from Af 211.50 to Af 200.00 per £ stg. 1. October 6. The proportion of the foreign currency salaries of foreign employees which must be converted into afghanis at the official rate was increased from 30 per cent to 40 per cent. November 12. Payments for imports through the banking system to all countries, except those with which Afghanistan has bilateral payments agreements, were allowed to be made against bills for collection or against an undertaking by the importer to import goods equal to at least the value of the payment made through the banking system. Previously such payments were allowed only under letters of credit. November 21. The Afghanistan Bank's selling rate for clearing dollars under the payments agreements with Czecho- slovakia and Yugoslavia was reduced from Af 70.50 to Af 68.50 per US$1. November 28. The Afghanistan Bank's selling rate for clearing dollars under the payments agreements with Czecho- slovakia and Yugoslavia was reduced from Af 68.50 to Af 65.50 per US$1. December 26. The prohibition on the import of cotton yam was terminated. 27 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ALGERIA Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.180000 gram of fine gold per Alge- rian Dinar, corresponding to DA 4.93706 = SDR 1 or DA 4.09257 = US$1, and Algeria avails itself of wider mar- gins. The exchange rate for the French franc is a fixed rate of DA 1 = F 1.12499; this rate is applied irrespective of the exchange market for which the settlement is eligible in France. l The Central Bank of Algeria deals in French francs and the other French Franc Area currencies at fixed rates. Buying and selling rates for specified currencies of countries outside the French Franc Area 2 are established by the Cen- tral Bank, generally on the basis of the daily rates quoted on the French official exchange market and other exchange mar- kets abroad. The exchange rate applicable to "agreement dol- lars** is the average rate for the U.S. dollar in the Paris official exchange market on the day preceding the entry on the clear- ing account. The Central Bank charges on its transactions in foreign currencies a commission ranging from 0.2 per mill to 0.4 per mill, depending on the nature of the transaction, and a tax of 6 per cent on the amount of the commission. A premium is granted on the conversion of convertible curren- cies repatriated by Algerians working abroad. The foreign exchange reserves are centralized in the Central Bank; authorized banks must clear their foreign currency position with their foreign correspondents at the end of each day but under certain conditions, they are permitted to hold outside Algeria cover for documentary credits. There are no forward exchange facilities. Administration of Control The Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank have general jurisdiction over exchange control. The Central Bank assists in the formulation of the exchange legislation and regulations and is responsible for their execution and for their application by the authorized banks. In addition, three commercial banks and the Postal Administration have been given authority to carry out some of the details of exchange control. Import and export licenses and global import authorization are issued by the Ministry of Commerce. Import and export licenses re- quire the visa of the Central Bank. The Office National de Commercialisation (ONACO), the Office Algerien Interprofes- sionnel de Cereales (OAIC), the Office National de Commer- cialisation des Produits Vitivinicoles (ONCV), the Societe Nationale des Tabacs et Allumettes (SNTA), the Societe Na- tionale d*Edition et de Diffusion (SNED), the Societe Na- tionale de Siderurgie (SNS), the Societe Nationale de Constructions Mecaniques (SONACOME), and other similar organizations have a monopoly over the import of a large number of commodities. The Societe Nationale pour la Re- cherche, la Production, le Transport, la Transformation et la Commercialisation des Hydrocarbures (SONATRACH) has a monopoly over imports and domestic sales of petroleum and petroleum products, and handles most exports of these commodities. Investment of foreign capital in excess of DA 500,000 in Algeria requires approval by a National In- vestment Committee in order to obtain the benefits of the Investment Code. All foreign borrowing requires the prior approval of the Minister of Finance. Prescription of Currency Algeria has certain traditional ties with the French Franc Area. The Central Bank does not maintain an Operations Account with the French Treasury and Algeria in principle applies its exchange controls to transactions with all countries. 3 Settlements with other countries in the French Franc Area are generally made in French francs. Settlements with countries with which Algeria has concluded bilateral payments agreements are made through special accounts un- der the terms of the agreements. Some of these accounts are denominated in Algerian dinars and others in U.S. dollars of account. Algeria maintains payments agreements with Alba- nia, Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, Czechoslova- kia, Egypt, Guinea, Hungary, North Korea, Poland, Romania, the U.S.S.R., and Yugoslavia. 4 Specified settle- ments with Morocco are channeled through a dirham account at the Bank of Morocco. Settlements with other countries may be made through the Paris exchange markets in French francs or in the currency of the country concerned. Nonresident Accounts For residents of countries outside the French Franc Area, the regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are similar to those applied until early 1967 in France; most of these accounts are Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dinars, which are held by diplomatic missions, or Internal Nonresident Ac- counts which are denominated in convertible dinars. For resi- dents of other French Franc Area countries, there are three types of accounts in Algerian dinars: Individual Suspense Accounts, Franc Area Accounts, and Final Departure Ac- counts. Except as described below, all operations through these accounts are subject to authorization. Individual Suspense Accounts may be opened without au- thorization and may be credited with payments from any country. Franc Area Accounts may be opened only with prior autho- rization from the Central Bank. They may be credited freely for authorized imports from the French Franc Area, and with proceeds from the sale of convertible currencies; with pro- ceeds from the sale of freely disposable funds (other than notes and coins) in the currencies of other countries of the French Franc Area; and with interest on the balances of Franc Area Accounts. The Central Bank may authorize the 1 On January 21, 1974 the fixed exchange rate for the French franc was discontinued. 2 These currencies are listed as Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Italian lire, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. 3 Since February 1967, France has applied to Algeria its controls on foreign investments in France and on French investments abroad. The exchange controls imposed by France on November 25, 1968, in its financial relations with foreign countries, and the dual market regulations introduced on Au- gust 23, 1971, are also applied to Algeria. 4 There is also an inoperative payments agreement with Cuba. 28 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution crediting of other payments. They may be debited freely for any payment in Algeria to a resident of any country in the French Franc Area (including Algeria); for any transfer to the credit of an account of a person residing in a country in the French Franc Area other than Algeria; and for any amount due to the bank with which the account is kept, for interest, commissions, or repayment of capital claims. Transfers be- tween these accounts are free. Final Departure Accounts may be opened, without prior authorization, in the name of any person residing in Algeria, but not of Algerian nationality, who intends to leave Algeria for another country in the French Franc Area. These ac- counts may be credited freely with an amount equivalent to the holdings at October 20, 1963 in the account of the person concerned; with the proceeds from sales of real estate of the account holder, provided that the sales are made through the intermediary of a notary public; with the proceeds of the sale of securities and the cashing of coupons; and with any other payments, up to DA 1,000. The Central Bank may authorize the crediting of other specific payments. These accounts may be debited without prior approval for certain payments in Algeria on behalf of the account holder. Outward transfers require individual approval; accounts holding balances up to DA 10,000 have been released for transfer abroad. The Central Bank of Algeria maintains special accounts for central banks of the countries with which Algeria has con- cluded payments agreements. Residents and nonresidents may maintain certain accounts in Algeria that are fed with the proceeds from the conversion of convertible currencies (comptes epargne-devises). Deposi- tors receive a premium equivalent to one eighth of the amounts deposited. 5 Withdrawals may be made in Algerian dinars only. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Israel, Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. Certain imports are prohibited regardless of origin. Commodities listed under some 600 tariff headings and subheadings are liberalized and do not require import licenses. All other imports are permitted, in principle, in ac- cordance with an annual import program. This is imple- mented mainly through global import authorizations (automations globales d"importation or AGI) granted to pub- lic enterprises. A small number of restricted commodities (produits contingent^ requires an individual import license (autorisation prealable d'importation or API), unless covered by a global import authorization. Imports made "without payment" (sanspaiement), i.e., imports which do not involve compensation of any kind, require no authorization, and are not charged against the global authorizations of public enter- prises; however, imports of automobiles "without payment" require the authorization of the Minister of Finance. The Government in principle has the monopoly over the importa- tion of many commodities through ONACO, OAIC, SNTA, ONCV, SNED, SNS, SONATRACH, SONACOME, and other 5 W i th effect from January 21, 1974, this premium was increased for persons working in France. ALGERIA similar organizations, but imports are not necessarily re- stricted to the monopoly holders. All imports must prior to the transaction be domiciled with an authorized bank, to which the necessary import docu- ments must be presented and through which all payments related to the transaction must be made. Unless the Central Bank approves otherwise, advance payments may not exceed DA 5,000 or 20 per cent of the import value, whichever is smaller. Payments for imports may be approved by, and set- tled through, the Postal Administration up to an import value of DA 5,000. All individual import licenses require the visa of the Central Bank. Some imports may be paid for as soon as the transaction has been domiciled. For other imports, unless earlier payment is to be made in accordance with the provisions of the import license or of a commercial contract approved by the authori- ties, payment to the foreign exporter may be made only after the shipping documents have been presented to the bank; the importer may in this case, after having domiciled the import, open a documentary import credit payable upon presentation of the shipping documents. Goods subject to import license and quota restrictions may be freely imported in small parcels, provided that the value of a shipment does not exceed DA 60 and the same addressee does not receive more than one parcel a day and that the parcels he receives during the year do not exceed DA 240 in value. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles to all countries require the approval of the Central Bank. However, when supporting documents are presented, approval may be granted by autho- rized banks, or sometimes by the Postal Administration, ei- ther freely or up to specified limits for certain payments such as (1) those relating to approved trade transactions and mari- time contracts, (2) travel expenses, (3) transfers of salaries and wages, (4) educational expenses, and (5) advertising ex- penses. For payments for which the approval authority has not been delegated, the granting of exchange must be autho- rized either by the Central Bank or the Ministry of Finance. Certain public enterprises, however, which receive special ex- change allocations (budget devises) may use these freely for payments for specified invisibles, including transportation and other services contracted abroad. The transfer of family remittances is suspended. Residents of other French Franc Area countries working in Algeria under the program for technical cooperation may transfer abroad a certain percentage of their net salaries, as follows: 50 per cent for single persons and married persons having their families in Algeria; 70 per cent for persons hav- ing their families abroad; and 100 per cent for employees who spend their vacations abroad (the transfer being limited to the duration of their absence from Algeria). For other workers from French Franc Area countries who have contracts with employers and hold the necessary employment documents, the amounts that may be transferred are 30 per cent, 50 per cent, and 100 per cent, respectively, for the groups enumer- ated above, and transfers are also permitted when the work- 29 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ALGERIA er's family is staying with him in Algeria. Residents of other countries who are employed in Algeria under the program of technical cooperation are permitted to transfer abroad 30, 50, and 100 per cent, respectively. For workers from other countries, who have contracts with employers and hold the necessary employment documents, the corresponding per- centages are 25, 45, and 100. The payments must be trans- ferred once a month on the basis of the remuneration for the previous month. Persons making such transfers of savings are not entitled to allocations for other personal transfers (e.g., for educational purposes). For residents traveling by air or sea to other countries, including countries in the French Franc Area, the foreign exchange allocation is equivalent to DA 100 a person a trip (DA 50 for children under 15) and is issued on presentation of a valid passport and travel documents; for overland travel, the allocation is DA 100 a person a year for adults and DA 50 for children under 15. These allocations are not appli- cable to persons living in border areas. Foreign travel requires the approval of the wali of the traveler's place of domicile. Algerian workers who hold a card of the Office National de la Main-d'Oeuvre (ONAMO) are entitled to the equivalent of DA 500 a person for the first trip abroad, and to the equiva- lent of DA 200 a person for each subsequent trip. Foreign exchange for private business travel, unless debited to an ED AC or EDAB Account (see Exports and Export Proceeds, below), is subject to authorization by the Central Bank and allocations cannot exceed DA 1,500 a trip. Pilgrims traveling to Saudi Arabia may obtain Saudi Ara- bian rivals up to the equivalent of DA 1,600 a person; the allocation can be taken up in the form of a check by those traveling by air or sea, and in banknotes by those traveling overland. Travelers may take out Algerian dinar banknotes up to DA 50 a person. Nonresident travelers may also re-export any foreign currency declared upon entry. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Israel, Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited and exports of hydrocarbons to the Nether- lands and the United States are suspended. Certain exports, including used equipment and machinery, livestock, firearms, ammunition, explosives, and certain radio equipment, are prohibited regardless of destination. Some exports to the French Franc Area, all exports to countries outside the French Franc Area that are not included in the free export list, and all exports to countries with which Algeria has bilat- eral payments agreements require licenses. The export of specified products is reserved for certain state trading organi- zations. Some commodities may be exported, subject to indi- vidual prior approval, on the basis of linked transactions (transactions liees) involving at the same time an authorized import transaction. With certain exceptions, exports must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Prior registration is not required for exports that are made on a firm sale basis, provided that they do not exceed DA 5,000 in value and that they are payable in not more than 60 days. After customs clearance, such exports must be registered, if they were not registered earlier. If the 30 payment period is more than 30 days, the exports may be registered only after authorization is given by the Central Bank. Sales on consignment are expressly subject to authori- zation by the Ministry of Finance, and registration must always take place prior to customs clearance. The proceeds of exports of commodities other than hydro- carbons, including those to the French Franc Area, must be repatriated immediately after the payment becomes due; the due date of the export contract must not be later than 60 days following shipment, except when prior authorization from the Central Bank is obtained. Those nationalized petroleum com- panies holding mineral rights in which the Algerian Govern- ment has acquired majority control must repatriate to Algeria the proceeds from their exports of hydrocarbons cal- culated on the basis of a reference price per barrel that is fixed by agreement with the companies concerned. For one petro- leum company holding mineral rights, however, there are different repatriation requirements. Exporters may retain 2 per cent (1 per cent for consignment sales) of the export proceeds of all commodities other than hydrocarbons in special accounts, unless exports are made on a compensation basis (echanges compenses). These accounts are of two kinds—ED AC (Exportateurs-dinars convertibles) and EDAB (Exportateurs-dinars bilateraux). Balances are nontransferable and may be used by the holder himself for business travel, certain services of foreign technicians, and imports of spare parts. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles must be repatriated and surren- dered. Savings repatriated by Algerians working abroad are eligible for an "encouragement premium." There are no re- strictions on the import of foreign banknotes, coins (except gold coins), checks, and letters of credit, but nonresidents, including those of Algerian nationality, must declare such holdings when they enter Algeria. Resident travelers may reimport Algerian dinar banknotes up to DA 50 a person. Nonresident travelers are not permitted to bring in Algerian banknotes. Capital Residents are obliged to repatriate and surrender capital assets (or the sales proceeds thereof) held or acquired outside Algeria. Capital transfers to any destination are subject to individual license; residents are not normally permitted to acquire capital assets outside Algeria. All borrowing abroad or from nonresidents is subject to prior approval by the Min- ister of Finance. A new Investment Code, superseding that of 1963, was promulgated by Ordinance No. 66-284 of September 15, 1966. It provides for state guarantees in respect of foreign investments of more than DA 500,000 in the industrial and tourist sectors. The new code provides for a retransfer guar- antee in respect of the sale or liquidation proceeds of invested foreign capital, and establishes that profit remittances on such investments will be permitted up to 15 per cent annually of the foreign capital originally invested. Tax facilities may also be granted, and investments of more than DA 5 million ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution may be given exclusive rights in a specified geographic area and may be accorded tariff protection. Remittances of profits and retransfers of capital are permitted only in respect of investments approved under Ordinance No. 66-284. Gold Residents may purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in Alge- ria for numismatic purposes. Imports and exports of gold in any form require licenses issued by the Central Bank; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports on behalf of authorized industrial and dental users, and licenses for imports for industrial use have not been issued for some time. Under the terms of Ordinance No. 70-6 of January 16,1970, unworked gold for industrial and profes- sional use is to be distributed by the Agence Nationale pour la Distribution et la Transformation de 1'Or et des Autres Metaux Precieux (AGENOR). This agency is also authorized to purchase in Algeria, and to hold, process, and distribute any other precious metal, and, within the exchange control regulations, to import and export any precious metal, includ- ing gold. Furthermore, locally produced gold must be sold to this agency. As at the end of 1973, AGENOR had not yet come into operation and some of its functions continued to be performed by the Central Bank (e.g., the issuance of im- port licenses for dental gold). Commercial imports of jewelry and of other articles containing gold are prohibited. Changes during 1973 January 1. Ordinance No. 72-68 of December 29, 1972 containing the 1973 budget introduced a new customs tariff. The import tariff henceforth comprised only a normal tariff, for goods originating in countries that accord Algeria most-favored-nation treatment, and a special tariff, which could be applied to imports originating in certain countries or groups of countries in return for similar advantages ex- tended by them, notably countries in the Maghreb group. The new customs tariff no longer provided for a separate mini- mum preferential tariff for goods of EEC origin, nor for a general tariff (with rates three times those of the normal tariff) for goods originating in countries (including Hong Kong and Japan) other than most-favored-nation and EEC countries. The special tariff was not applied to EEC countries, which consequently lost the tariff preferences they previously en- joyed. The rates of the new normal tariff, however, generally were identical with those of the former preferential tariff. February 1. Notice No. 72 of the Ministry of Finance was issued concerning transfers abroad in accordance with con- tracts concluded by national public enterprises with foreign enterprises. February 13. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Algeria maintained the value of its ALGERIA currency unchanged in terms of gold. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously DA 4.54729 = US$1, became DA 4.09257 = US$1. February 20. Circular No. 21 of the Ministry of Commerce revised certain procedures for imports within the framework of global import authorizations. June 12. Notice No. 73 made imports "without payment" of automobiles subject to authorization by the Minister of Finance. June 18. The 12V2 per cent "encouragement premium" introduced by an Order of the Ministry of Finance of Au- gust 1, 1972, and paid on the convertible currency savings of Algerians working abroad, henceforth was granted immedi- ately upon conversion of the foreign exchange. June 18. The import facilities for Algerians working abroad were improved. Henceforth, they could also bring in an auto- mobile, provided they had stayed abroad at least three years. July 10. Notice No. 75 reintroduced privileges (similar to those previously granted by means of EFAC—Exporta- tions-Frais Accessoires—accounts) for certain export pro- ceeds. Exporters of all commodities other than products of the petroleum and gas sector could retain 2 per cent of the repatriated foreign exchange in special foreign currency ac- counts (1 per cent for exports sold on a consignment basis). There were two types of accounts: EDAC (Exportateurs- dinars convertibles) and EDAB (Exportateurs-dinars bilate- raux). No more than DA 10,000 for each export transaction could be credited to these accounts, and at no time could the balance in any one account exceed DA 100,000. Balances were personal and nontransferable but could at any time be converted into dinars. They could be used for business travel, payments for services performed by foreign nationals visiting Algeria briefly, imports of spare parts, and for any other transaction that the Central Bank might authorize. There were special provisions for exports made by public sector companies. Notices Nos. 501 and 31ZF were revoked. July 20. Algeria established an initial par value of 0.180000 gram of fine gold per Algerian dinar, corresponding to DA 4.93706 = SDR 1. Algeria also availed itself of wider margins. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar remained unchanged at DA 4.09257 = US$1. July 27. Notice No. 76 modified Notice No. 71 of July 10, 1972 concerning the allocation of foreign exchange to nonres- ident travelers of Algerian nationality at the time of returning to their country of residence. The allocation continued to be limited to 10 per cent of the amount of foreign exchange converted at the time of entry, but ceased to be subject to a ceiling of DA 500. August 4. Amounts up to DA 10,000 held in Final Depar- ture Accounts were released for transfer abroad. October 1. Ordinance No. 73-54 created the Central Rein- surance Company. October 17. Exports of hydrocarbons to the United States and the Netherlands were suspended. 31 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ARGENTINA Exchange Rate System On January 9, 1957, a par value for the Argentine Peso was established by Argentina with the Fund. However, exchange transactions no longer take place at rates based on that par value. All exchange transactions take place in a dual exchange market. In principle, the commercial market covers trade transactions and the financial market all other transactions, but in practice many import and export transactions are set- tled entirely or in part at the financial exchange rate, and at the end of 1973 no transactions took place entirely at the commercial rate. In the commercial market, the Central Bank of Argentina deals with banks and authorized institutions at the rate of $a 5.00 per US$1, buying and selling. In the financial market the exchange rate, which in principle is a fluctuating one, has been stable since May 1972; on Decem- ber 31, 1973, it was $a 9.98 (selling) per US$1. The effective exchange rate for nonpromoted exports (in- cluding the basic traditional exports) and for many imports is a mixing rate derived from the conversion of 26 per cent of the amounts concerned at the commercial rate and 74 per cent at the financial rate. Promoted exports (i.e., commodities listed in Decree No. 3255/71, as amended), exports from Tierra del Fuego, all imports of goods in List 2 of Circular R.C. 446, imports from LAFTA countries of most goods on the lists of Decrees Nos. 7250/72 and 7251/72, all imports on a compensation basis of goods covered by Decree No. 2618/68, and exports and imports of books, newspapers, periodicals, and gold are settled entirely through the financial market. Imports of pearls, diamonds, platinum, and palla- dium also are settled entirely at the financial rate. l All for- eign exchange received by residents that does not constitute export proceeds must be sold in the financial market. Sales of foreign exchange to residents for travel purposes (other than official travel) are subject to an exchange tax of $a 2.00 per US$1. Certain remittances of profits are subject to a tax of 20-40 per cent. Exchange transactions between banks and individuals, other than transactions in banknotes, are subject to a tax of 1 per cent (10 per mill) on sales to customers and 3 per mill on purchases. Forward exchange transactions may be concluded between individuals and authorized banks or among authorized banks at the prevailing financial rate, subject to freely agreed premi- ums or discounts. Forward exchange purchases by the public are restricted to those concluded as part of a swap transac- tion, or to cover import payments made under documentary credit, bank collection, or bank guarantee. Swap operations must be submitted to the Central Bank for prior approval. Forward exchange purchases covering import payments re- quire a 40 per cent deposit in local currency for a period of 'W i th effect from January 11, 1974 all imports exempted by special authorization from the temporary import bans also had to be settled entirely at the financial rate. On January 25, 1974 imports of specified raw materials and intermediate products became eligible (up to the amount of the f.o.b. value and within global limits to be established by the Central Bank) for the commercial rate, with retroactive effect for goods shipped after September 15, 1973 and not yet paid for. This regime was an optional one, importers of the goods concerned remaining free to import them under the ruling regulations based on Circular R.C. 446. 32 180 days; this deposit may not be financed by local banks. Forward exchange contracts connected with imports may be extended for a period of up to 180 days from the date of their original maturity; those corresponding to exports may be extended only once, for a period of 30 days (or, where ship- ment is unavoidably delayed, for the period of the delay). Such contracts may be settled through clearing in the ex- change market. The Central Bank intervenes in the financial forward exchange market as a seller of U.S. dollars at a premium which at the end of 1973 was 20 per cent per annum. Argentina formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from May 14, 1968. Administration of Control All exchange transactions must be carried out through entities authorized expressly for this purpose. These include exchange agencies and exchange houses. Prescription of Currency Virtually all payments between Argentina and Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela are made through accounts maintained with each other by the Central Bank of Argentina and the central banks concerned, under reciprocal credit agreements within the framework of the LAFTA multilateral clearing system. Transactions with other countries must be settled in convert- ible currencies. Proceeds from exports to 14 countries in Western Europe and to Canada and Japan must be received in the currency of the importing country. 2 Import payments to these countries may be made either in the currency of the country concerned or in U.S. dollars. All settlements with other countries with which no reciprocal credit agreement is in force must be made or received in U.S. dollars or in any of the 16 currencies referred to previously. Nonresident Accounts Authorized banks may open accounts in pesos and in for- eign exchange in the name of any nonresident, provided that the accounts are fed with remittances of convertible curren- cies only. Balances on nonresident accounts may be used freely for any purpose, in Argentina or abroad. Transfers between accounts may be effected freely, except in payment of exports. Imports and Import Payments Imports are in principle free of import and exchange licens- ing. 3 However, all imports by the public sector require the prior approval of the Ministry of Commerce. Furthermore, certain imports of luxury goods or nonessential goods are 2 With effect from January 10, 1974, export proceeds from these countries could be received either in the currency of the importing country or in U.S. dollars. 3 At the end of 1973, most imports were ruled by Central Bank Circular R.C. 446 (and complementing circulars) in conjunction with Decree No. 7250/72. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ARGENTINA prohibited. All imports require a sworn declaration of need submitted by the importer (declaration jurada) to the Minis- try of Commerce. Also, sales of foreign exchange for virtually all imports with foreign financing of less than 180 days re- quire the prior approval of the Central Bank. Most goods of LAFTA origin are exempt from the import suspensions. Independently of these temporary measures, goods im- ported by official agencies require approval by the Ministry of Economy if payment is extended over a period of more than 180 days. Furthermore, all public sector imports are screened by a special body, the Asesoria de Importaciones del Sector Oficial. Imports of some vehicles, tractors, and engines are prohibited. Import taxes include the following: a consular fee of 1 ARGENTINA and from all goods exported from the special customs terri- tory in Tierra del Foego are eligible for the financial rate, while all other exports are settled at the mixing rate (74 per cent at the financial rate and 26 per cent at the commercial rate). Many products are subject to export taxes (derechos de exportation) calculated on the basis of the f.o.b. sales value or on index values. The tax must be paid before shipment of the merchandise or within the following 30 days when there is a bank aval that guarantees its payment. All exports are subject to a 2 per cent tax on the freight. Certain other taxes on specific exports are also levied. These include a 1.75 per cent tax, the proceeds of which are destined for the National Insti- tute for Agricultural Technology, on exports of agricultural and livestock products. Many exports, particularly nontradi- tional exports, are eligible for export incentives of various kinds. The Central Bank has established a system of special fi- nancing, to be granted to Argentine exporters through banks, with a view to promoting certain exports of goods and ser- vices. The National Export Credit Insurance Commission provides credit insurance for exports of capital goods and consumer durable goods. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange derived from invisibles must be surrendered in the financial market within 30 days of receipt. Travelers may bring in freely any amount in domestic or foreign banknotes and coins. Capital Exchange proceeds from capital inflows received by resi- dents must be surrendered in the financial market within 30 days of receipt. There are no limitations on inward capital transfers by residents or nonresidents. Outward capital trans- fers are restricted. Argentine "External Bonds" may be ex- ported freely. Sales of exchange in connection with investments, placements, or deposits within Argentina or abroad require the prior approval of the Central Bank. Ar- gentine industrial or commercial firms require the authoriza- tion of the Central Bank to enter into swap operations un- der which loans may be accepted in a convertible currency. Foreign borrowing by the public sector is regulated by Decree-Law No. 19328 of October 29, 1971. The former Foreign Investment Law (Decree-Law No. 19151 of July 30, 1971) provided that all new foreign invest- ments must have government approval and must be regis- tered. Profits and dividends could then be remitted from the end of the first year of operation. The firms concerned were permitted to receive domestic short-term credit up to 50 per cent of their registered capital and accumulated reserves; this limitation did not apply to export credit. Foreign companies established in Argentina prior to the promulgation of the law were required to register their capital in the investment regis- ter in order to be eligible for remittances of profits and divi- dends or for repatriation of capital. Implementing regulations were contained in Decree No. 2400 of April 27, 1972. 34 A new Foreign Investment Law (Law No. 20557 of No- vember 7, 1973) provides that all new foreign investment must be made under the terms of a contract negotiated with the "Authority of Application." The law distinguishes, ac- cording to the degree of foreign ownership, between national, mixed, and foreign companies. In the case of companies with 51 per cent or more foreign participation, the contract must be approved by the Congress; for companies with between 20 per cent and 51 per cent foreign capital, the contract needs approval by the President. Repatriation of capital may not take place until at least five years after the investment was made, and the annual amount of repatriation must not exceed 20 per cent of the capital eligible for repatriation. No repatria- tion of capital is permitted if it endangers the continued exis- tence of the firm. Each contract establishes a maximum limit of domestic short-term indebtedness, and no long-term do- mestic indebtedness may normally occur. Remittances abroad of profits and dividends are limited to 12.5 per cent or a rate exceeding by 4 percentage points the rate for time deposits of 180 days in the foreign country concerned, whichever is higher, calculated on the basis of the foreign capital eligible for repatriation. Existing foreign and mixed companies in Argentina may remain subject to their previous regulations or negotiate a contract under the new law. However, if they choose the former option, their remit- tances of profits and dividends become subject to a special transfer tax varying with the annual amount of the remittance as a percentage of foreign capital invested. Gold Residents may hold gold coins and gold in any other form in Argentina or abroad. They may sell gold in coins and bars in Argentina to institutions and houses authorized to deal in foreign exchange, but the regulations permitting nonbank residents to buy gold coins and bars from these firms are in suspense. Imports of gold must be settled through the finan- cial market. Imports by industrial users are subject to a statis- tical duty of %0 of 1 per cent, and those by others are subject in addition to sales tax. Exports of gold may be carried out by institutions and houses authorized to engage in exchange transactions; they require the prior approval of the Central Bank and the proceeds must be received in convertible cur- rencies. Changes during 1973 January 2. By virtue of the Central Bank's Telephone Com- munication No. 2705, the validity of import letters of credit was restricted, with minor exceptions, to 180 days (one year for capital goods covered by Circular R.C. 328). January 4. Export rebates for cane sugar exports were introduced of 15 per cent of the value of the export. January 5. A large number of the goods whose importation had been suspended for 90 days from October 20, 1972 by Decree No. 7251/72 were assigned to List 2 of Circular R.C. 446 (permitted imports payable entirely at the financial rate). One item was shifted from the list of Decree No. 7251/72 to List 1 of Circular R.C. 446 (permitted imports payable at the existing mixing rate for imports, i.e., 74 per cent at the finan- ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution rial rate and 26 per cent at the commercial rate), and one from the list of Decree No. 7251/72 to the list of Decree No. 7250/72 (goods whose importation had been suspended for 180 days by Decree No. 7250/72). (Circular R.C. 455.) The temporary import bans imposed by Decrees Nos. 7250/72 and 7251/72 were not applicable to the goods listed when they originated in LAFTA countries and were covered by Argentina's National List, its special list (for Bolivia, Ec- uador, Paraguay, and Uruguay), any complementarity agree- ment, or the list of Decree No. 4091 /72; these exempt imports were payable entirely at the financial rate if listed in Decree No. 7250/72 and at the ruling mixing rate if listed in Decree No. 7251/72. January 16. A number of items were added to the list of those exempted from the 40 per cent advance import deposit. (Circular R.C. 458.) January 22. A large number of import products on the list of Decree No. 7251 /72 were assigned to Lists 1 and 2 of Circular R.C. 446 or to the list of Decree No. 7250/72, most of them to List 2. A few items were transferred from List 1 to List 2. (Circular R.C. 460.) January 30. A number of import items from the list of Decree No. 7251/72 were assigned to List 2 and the list of Decree No. 7250/72, most of them to the latter. (Circular R.C. 461.) February 5. Private exports of wheat flour were suspended by Decree No. 992. (Private exports of wheat had been sus- pended on December 12, 1972.) February 20. The mixing rate for the exchange proceeds from promoted exports (nontraditional exports listed in De- cree No. 5062/71, as amended) was modified by an increase from 74 per cent to 90 per cent in the portion that could be sold in the financial market, and a corresponding reduction from 26 per cent to 10 per cent in the portion that must be sold in the commercial market. (Circular R.C. 463.) The exchange proceeds from traditional exports continued to be settled 74 per cent at the financial market rate and 26 per cent at the commercial market rate. (Circular R.C. 441.) February 21. It was announced that the new exchange rate for promoted exports announced by Circular R.C. 463 was applicable only to items listed in Decree No. 3255/71, as amended. (Circular R.C. 464.) February 21. A few import items were transferred from List 2 to List 1. (Circular R.C. 465.) March 14. The full exchange proceeds from exports from the special customs territory created by Law No. 19.640 in Tierra del Fuego could, with retroactive effect to March 1, be sold entirely in the financial market. (Circular R.C. 467, im- plementing Decree No. 1261 of February 14, 1973.) March 26. The Central Bank invited subscriptions to a third series of U.S. dollar-denominated external five-year bonds (1973 External Dollar Bonds), authorized by Decree No. 2082 of March 19. Such bonds would again be available for the settlement of obligations abroad resulting from divi- dends, profits, royalties, and other liabilities that had fallen due. (Circular R.C. 469.) April 18. The temporary ban on imports of goods in the list of Decree No. 7250/72 was extended for another 180 days from April 23, 1973. (Decree No. 3042/73.) ARGENTINA April 23. Proceeds from exports to 14 countries in Western Europe and to Canada and Japan had to be received in the currency of the importing country, rather than, as previously, in U.S. dollars. Import payments to those countries could be made either in the currency of the country concerned or in U.S. dollars, while all settlements with other countries (ex- cept those with which reciprocal credit agreements were in force) had to be made or received in U.S. dollars or in any of the 16 currencies indicated in the first sentence. (Circular B. 1018/R.C. 470.) April24. Decree-Law No. 20299 and Decree No. 3145/73 established an expanded and liberalized facility for export credit insurance. April 26. The proportion of the exchange proceeds from promoted exports (listed in Decree No. 3255/71, as amended) that could be sold in the financial market was increased from 90 per cent to 100 per cent. The exchange proceeds from traditional exports continued to be settled 74 per cent at the financial market rate and 26 per cent at the commercial mar- ket rate. (Circular R.C. 471 of April 30.) May 3. A number of import items were added to Lists 1 and 2 of Circular R.C. 446 and to the list of Decree No. 7250/72. Two items were transferred from List 2 to List 1. (Circular R.C. 472.) May 10. The ban on imports of specified nonessential goods (which had been introduced on June 30, 1971 by De- cree No. 2118/71 and extended on May 15, 1972 by Decree No. 2867/72) was extended until May 15, 1974.

The allocation for travel to neighboring countries was maintained at US$10 a person a day, subject to a limit of US$300 a person a trip. Allocations for study abroad were up to US$300 a person a month, and those for family remittances up to US$50 a month for each remittor and beneficiary. The rules governing the export of Argentine or foreign securities ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution were modified. There were no changes in respect of import payments or the servicing of foreign credit. Circular R.C. 445 and Telephone Communications Nos. 2469, 2474 (except the provisions regarding forward exchange contracts related to exports), 2532, and 2706 were revoked. (Circular R.C. 485 of October 26.) November 7. A new Foreign Investment Law (Law No. 20557) was approved. Implementing regulations would be issued within 120 days. Preference would be given to new investment in priority sectors. New foreign investment was prohibited in some sectors, including banking, insurance, de- fense, communications, the mass media, marketing, and, ex- cept in particular circumstances, agriculture and fishing. The law distinguished between national companies (whose capital must be over 80 per cent Argentine owned), mixed companies (with Argentine ownership 51 per cent or more but not more than 80 per cent), and foreign companies (with Argentine ownership at less than 51 per cent). Repatriation of foreign capital would be allowed after an initial period of at least five years, provided the continuity of the local firm was assured. Not more than 20 per cent of the capital could be repatriated in any one year. Remittance of profits abroad was made subject to an an- nual limit of 12Y2 per cent of capital eligible for repatriation, or a rate exceeding by 4 percentage points the interest rate on time deposits of 180 days in the foreign country in question, whichever was higher; such remittances could not be financed with domestic or foreign credit. The reinvestment of remitta- ble profits required authorization. Existing foreign-owned companies, i.e., companies whose capital was at least 20 per cent foreign owned, had to choose whether or not to abide by the terms of the new law. If they chose to abide by the old Foreign Investment Law (Law No. 19151 of July 30, 1971), a special transfer tax was imposed on remittances of profits; this tax ranged from 20 per cent on ARGENTINA remittances of 6 per cent or less of the invested capital to 40 per cent on those of over 15 per cent of the capital. In the event of a critical balance of payments situation the repatriation of capital and remittance of profits could be postponed by the Central Bank. The Law came into force on December 6, the date of its publication in the Official Gazette. November 7. Law No. 20558 established the Corporation de Empresas Nacionales. November 11. Law No. 20545, the Law for the Protection of Argentine Production, was adopted. It gave the Govern- ment additional powers to protect national production and labor by means of increases in customs duties; to promote industrial exports; to control imports and exports; to estab- lish official minimum prices for imports and fixed or mini- mum index prices for exports; and to control reimbursement and drawback facilities for exports. The law came into force on December 22. November 14. The Chamber of Deputies approved Law No. 20560, the Industrial Promotion Law. It came into force on December 13. The Law provided for certain facilities and benefits for the creation, expansion, or modernization of in- dustries; such facilities and benefits could only be granted to firms whose capital was at least 80 per cent Argentine owned. November 20. Law No. 20551, the Mining Promotion Law, was promulgated. December 17. The declaration jurada henceforth was ac- cepted automatically for the import of goods in short supply on international markets. (Resolution No. 775/73 of the Min- istry of Economy). December 21. Imports of specified chemicals became ex- empt from the mandatory minimum payments terms of 180 days after shipment (Telephone Communication No. 2920). On December 28 this exemption was extended to additional goods by Telephone Communication No. 2922. 37 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Exchange Rate System Nonresident Accounts AUSTRALIA 1 The par value is 1.09578 grams of fine gold per Australian Dollar, corresponding to $A 0.810994 = SDR 1 or $A 1 = US$1.4875. From time to time the Reserve Bank of Australia sets official limits within which banks must effect spot trans- actions with the public in U.S. dollars, the intervention cur- rency; on December 31, 1973 these limits were US$1.4900 and US$1.4850 per $A 1. Banks are free to determine their own spot rates for all other currencies, including sterling; rates quoted are based on closing rates in London and New York. Forward exchange cover may be arranged through the authorized banks by residents for periods appropriate to the nature of the transaction in respect of most exchange risks arising out of trade transactions. Forward exchange cover for transactions in certain invisibles of a noncapital nature may also be arranged. The Reserve Bank provides forward cover to the trading banks in U.S. dollars and sterling. Banks act as principals in all foreign currency transactions, both spot and forward, and are free to determine their own forward rates for all currencies; they are required to restrict their uncovered positions and not to carry excessive balances abroad. Australia formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from July 1, 1965. Administration of Control Exchange control policy is determined by the Government with the advice of the Department of the Treasury and of the Reserve Bank of Australia. The Reserve Bank administers the exchange control on behalf of the Australian Treasurer and delegates considerable discretionary powers to the trading banks authorized to handle foreign exchange transactions. Import and export licensing is administered by the Depart- ment of Customs and Excise, with some other departments being responsible for the administration of controls on certain imports and exports. Prescription of Currency Where imports are invoiced in Australian dollars, pay- ments may be made in Australian currency through the ac- count of an overseas bank with a bank in Australia, or in any foreign currency; 2 if imports are invoiced in foreign currency, payment must be made in foreign currency. Proceeds from exports may be received in Australian currency from an ac- count of an overseas bank with a bank in Australia, or in any foreign currency. 1 The monetary area of Australia includes Papua New Guinea. The Australian dollar circulates in a number of countries, including the New Hebrides, the British Solomon Islands Protectorate, Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony, and the Republic of Nauru. 2 Foreign currencies are defined as all currencies other than the Australian dollar. 38 All credits to the accounts of nonresidents are subject to approval, which is granted in the same circumstances and subject to the same conditions as if a transfer to the country of residence of the account holder were involved. Transfers are allowed freely, on application, between accounts of non- residents. Under current policy, the balance on an account held by any nonresident may be withdrawn in convertible currency. There are no blocked accounts. Nonresidents may not borrow in Australia. Imports and Import Payments With the few exceptions mentioned below, goods may be imported freely without import licenses, and no restrictions are imposed on payments for imports. The latter normally must be made not later than six months after the arrival of the goods in Australia; consent to longer deferment is given only where it is established that longer periods are normal commercial practice. Import licenses are required for used, secondhand, or disposals machinery or equipment and parts therefor (earthmoving or excavating vehicles, machinery or equipment; tractors, road rollers, or material-handling equip- ment); and disposals, used, or secondhand four-wheel drive vehicles (excluding public-service type passenger vehicles). Ships are classified as prohibited imports, and new or second- hand ships may only be imported with the written consent of the Minister for Transport. In addition, import controls are maintained on certain goods, irrespective of origin, mainly for reasons of health, morals, or security, or to maintain quality standards. In accordance with the relevant Resolutions of the UN Security Council, mandatory sanctions have been applied against Rhodesia. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles are subject to exchange control, but, with the exception of remittances to Rhodesia (except in certain circumstances), they are not restricted. The control operates primarily to prevent unauthorized capital transfers; remittances to the New Hebrides are subject to a screening procedure to ensure that no tax minimization transactions are involved. Applications for outward transfers in connection with current invisibles are normally dealt with immediately by banks; no forms have to be filled out for amounts up to $A 2,000, and banks need not report these smaller transfers to the Reserve Bank. There is no limit on travel funds. Banks may approve up to $A 4,000 in any 12 months for any kind of travel in any country; additional amounts may be obtained on application, provided that the exchange control authori- ties are satisfied that the exchange is to be used for bona tide travel expenses and not for an authorized capital transfer. Similarly, no limits are placed on remittances for family main- tenance and gifts, but beyond certain amounts, applications must be referred to the exchange control authorities; such applications are treated liberally. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Payment to overseas suppliers of services must be made no later than six months after the date when payment is contrac- tually due; consent to longer deferment is given only where it is established that longer periods are normal commercial practice. Dividends and interest due to overseas residents must be paid within one month of the date on which they become payable. Foreign exchange is not normally provided to enable residents to take out personal life insurance with foreign insurers. Travelers who are not residents of Australia may take out any amount in foreign or domestic banknotes within six months of entry, provided that they brought the notes into Australia. Other travelers may take out up to $A 100 in Australian currency, without special authorization; of this amount, up to $A 4 may be in coins. Exports and Export Proceeds The export of all commodities, unless specifically ex- empted, requires an export license in terms of the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations, to ensure that the full pro- ceeds are received in a currency and within a period approved by the Reserve Bank; the approved period is within six months prior to or after the date of exportation, but where the value of the goods exceeds $A 10,000 the approved period for receipt prior to the date of exportation is one month, longer periods being allowed only where the prepayment is in accordance with normal commercial practice. To assist super- vision, there is a further condition (in the case of export licenses covering goods exported by ship) that all shipping documents, bills of lading, etc., must be drawn to the order of and delivered to the Reserve Bank or to a trading bank acting as its agent. The Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regu- lations prohibit the export of specified goods either absolutely or subject to prescribed conditions. The controls have been established for a variety of purposes. Thus, export controls have been imposed on minerals in raw or semiprocessed form to ensure that export prices are at a reasonable level and that there is a balanced development of Australian mineral re- sources. Controls have also been utilized to ensure adequate supplies to meet domestic requirements (e.g., agricultural products, primarily stock foods and fertilizers, and some min- erals and metals), to enable Australia to comply with obliga- tions under international agreements, and to assist the orderly marketing of primary products. In accordance with UN Resolution No. 253 of 1968, Australia enforces trade sanctions against Rhodesia. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles in foreign currencies do not have to be surrendered, but may be disposed of only with permis- sion. Travelers may bring in any amount in foreign or domes- tic banknotes. Capital All transfers of capital from Australia require approval. Lending overseas by residents is normally not permitted other than in association with direct investments. Proposals for direct investment overseas are considered on a case- AUSTRALIA by-case basis. Transfers abroad for direct investment involv- ing the export of a significant measure of Australian manage- rial or technical skills are readily approved. Approval is also readily given for all types of investment which promote Aus- tralian exports or protect existing Australian investments abroad. Approval is normally granted for the repatriation of capital by nonresidents, but no advance commitments are given. Foreign securities owned by Australian residents need not be surrendered; approval is given to residents to reinvest the sales proceeds from foreign securities for their own ac- count in other foreign securities, but they are not normally permitted to trade among themselves in foreign securities except those issued off an Australian register. The export of securities and certain transactions in foreign securities are subject to approval. Applications by resident individuals to invest abroad in amounts up to $A 10,000 in any 12-month period normally are readily approved; institutional investors and public com- panies can expect to receive permission to make investments abroad of up to $A 1 million in any 12-month period. Appli- cations for investments in larger amounts are considered in special circumstances. Eligible investments include portfolio investments abroad in stocks and shares and investments in real estate; they do not include investments in loans or other fixed-interest securities. Investments in tax haven countries are subject to a screening procedure to ensure that no tax minimization transactions are involved. Approval is required for residents to borrow Australian or foreign currency from any nonresident, or to incur a liability to a nonresident; the coverage of the controls over overseas borrowings includes not only formal contracts to borrow but also indirect forms of borrowings and transactions having a similar effect on capital inflow. In addition, residents are required to obtain approval to draw, issue, or negotiate any bill of exchange or promissory note, to enter into contracts (except for the purchase of goods) or to acknowledge debts so that actual or contingent rights to payments, any other valuable consideration, or services are created in favor of any nonresident, or to allot or transfer securities to, or register securities in the name of, any nonresident. Borrowings from overseas lenders of foreign or Australian currency in amounts exceeding $A 100,000 in any 12-month period which are repayable, or carry options to repay, in two years or less are not permitted (other than for trade transactions on normal trade credit terms). Persons receiving approval for foreign borrowings for periods greater than two years in excess of $A 100,000 in any 12-month period (other than for trade transactions on normal trade credit terms) are required to lodge with the Reserve Bank, through their own banks, inter- est free, a nonassignable deposit in local currency amounting to 33V3 per cent of the amount drawn (drawings under loan agreements approved by the Reserve Bank prior to Decem- ber 27, 1972 are exempt, and for those under loan agreements approved since that date but prior to October 26, 1973 the rate of deposit is 25 per cent). The borrowing restrictions, including the deposit require- ment, also are applicable to acceptance of deposits from over- seas residents by a wide range of financial intermediaries. The borrowing embargo also applies to subscriptions by nonresi- 39 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution AUSTRALIA dents to new issues of fixed-interest securities having a matu- rity of two years or less ("short-term securities")* and to purchases by nonresidents of existing securities having two years or less to run to ma tur i ty. The deposit requirement also applies to subscriptions to new issues of securities having a ma tu r i ty of more than two years. These restrictions apply to deposits and fixed-interest securities where the funds ten- dered by, or on behalf of, an overseas resident were remitted to Australia for this purpose on and after February 2, 1973. Deposits are held for the period of the borrowing and are refundable proportionately as loans are repaid. For the time being, Australian banks are required to sight specific Reserve Bank approval for all inward capital remittances of $A 50,000 or more. Increases in indebtedness through intercompany accounts which could have the effect of circumventing the borrowing controls are prohibited. Inward equity investment requires exchange control ap- proval. The Government's general policy on such investment is flexible and there are, for example, no general mandatory levels of Australian equity in new ventures. However, the Government has a firm policy objective of securing the high- est possible levels of ownership and control of Australian resources and industries and ensuring that foreign capital inflows are associated with productive investment which adds to Australia's real resources. The policy is being applied in a pragmatic way with all cases being considered on their merits. There are some special areas in foreign investments to which the Government has given particular attention. These include the important energy minerals where the policy objec- tive is full Australian ownership. Real estate is another; in this field the Government has discouraged foreign interests from making significant investments, particularly for subdivisions for resale for residential purposes and for development in central city areas. In the fringe banking area, the Government has indicated its view that, generally, there would be little benefit in allow- ing additional institutions to be established by foreign inter- ests. The Government has also made clear its general objective of preventing increases in foreign ownership and control of existing financial institutions. Furthermore, the Government has said it regards insurance as a "key" industry, and has stated its view that it does not generally favor the establishment of new life and general insurance companies, particularly the establishment of new foreign-controlled com- panies. The long-standing controls over inward investment in the fields of banking, civil aviation, and radio and television are being continued. Measures introduced on September 26, 1972 provide for the prevention of foreign take-overs of Australian businesses judged by the Government to be contrary to the national interest. The Companies (Foreign Take-Overs) Act, 1972-73 gives legal backing to these measures insofar as they relate to foreign take-overs of companies through the acquisition of shares. Under the legislation, the acquisition by a foreign person or associated persons of 15 per cent of the voting capital (or 40 per cent by foreign persons in the aggregate) is regarded, prima facie, as a foreign take-over. However, in order to take action in respect of a proposal, the Treasurer must be satisfied that the acquisition of shares in question 40 would lead to the transfer of effective control to foreign inter- ests and that the exercise of such control would be contrary to the national interest. The Act does not apply where over- seas interests already exercise effective control of the com- pany being taken over or where the foreign acquisition of shares would not result in effective foreign control. Except in special circumstances, the Act is not applied to the take-overs of companies whose assets do not exceed $A 1 million. The screening and examination of foreign take-over proposals is undertaken by a committee made up of officials from appro- priate government departments. The committee's reports are submitted to the Government for decision. The Government's screening of take-over proposals has gone beyond the Companies (Foreign Take-Overs) Act itself. This Act deals with take-overs arising through the acquisition of shares. Under broader policy measures the Government has also screened take-overs of Australian businesses through the acquisition of the assets of the business. There are no restrictions on domestic bank credit to over- seas-owned or overseas-controlled companies in Australia. Gold Residents must surrender to the Reserve Bank all gold coming into their possession in Australia with the exception of gold coins the gold content value of which does not exceed $A 50 and gold lawfully acquired for use in a profession or trade; gold producers in Papua New Guinea are exempt from this requirement. Newly mined gold acquired by the Reserve Bank is made available at its official buying price of $A 28.38 a tine ounce to an association of gold producers for sale at free market prices to local industrial users or overseas purchasers. Subject to certain conditions, domestic gold producers are eligible for subsidy under the Gold-Mining Industry Assist- ance Act. Imports of gold are not restricted but imported gold becomes subject to delivery to the Reserve Bank. Ex- ports of gold require the approval of the Reserve Bank. Gold jewelry is not subject to acquisition by the Reserve Bank and imports of such items are unrestricted. Exports of gold jew- elry exceeding $A 250 in value require an export license. Travelers require an export license if taking out of Australia certain specified goods, including gold jewelry, in excess of a total value of $A 10,000 or when the gold content value of any one article exceeds $A 1,000. Changes during 1973 January 1. Export quotas were imposed on tin. They were discontinued on October 1. January 11. The special restrictions on transfers to speci- fied bodies in Viet-Nam were removed. January 18. The special restrictions on imports from Rho- desia were intensified. January 30. The Reserve Bank raised from 1 per cent to 2 per cent per annum its basic forward discount in offering forward cover for banks' U.S. dollar commitments to export- ers. This discount was raised to 4 per cent on June 29 and continued at that level during the remainder of the year. January 31. It was announced that export controls would be imposed on all minerals, whether in their raw state or ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution partly processed, including those not covered previously. These controls came into effect on February 23. February 1. The trade agreement with the United Kingdom was terminated. On the same date, the first step toward the dismantling of the tariff preferences granted to the United Kingdom was taken by the abolition of a 7V2 per cent duty on by-law imports from nonpreferential countries. February 2. The coverage of the controls over overseas borrowings was extended to include not only formal con- tracts to borrow but also indirect forms of borrowings and transactions having a similar effect on capital inflow. (1) Deferment of payments due to overseas residents in respect of imports, services, dividends, and interest was restricted. Payment to overseas suppliers for goods and services must normally be made not later than six months after the arrival of the goods in Australia, or, in the case of services, after the date when payment was contractually due (consent to longer deferment would be given where it was established that longer periods were normal commercial practice); dividends and interest due to overseas residents must be paid within one month of the date on which they became payable. (2) Accep- tance of prepayment for exports exceeding $A 10,000 a trans- action for longer than one month before the date of shipment would no longer be approved unless the Reserve Bank was satisfied that such prepayment was in accordance with nor- mal commercial practice. (3) Increases in indebtedness through intercompany accounts 3 which could have the effect of circumventing the borrowing controls were prohibited and a surveillance procedure was established over intercompany accounts. (4) The existing borrowing restrictions, including the deposit requirement, would now be applied also to depos- its by overseas residents with such parties as finance compa- nies, pastoral companies, short-term money market dealers, merchant banks, acceptance houses, building societies, bro- kers, solicitors, and nominee companies. (5) The borrowing embargo would also apply to subscriptions by nonresidents to new issues of fixed-interest securities having a maturity of two years or less (short-term securities), and to purchases by nonresidents of existing securities having two years or less to run to maturity. Short-term securities for these purposes were defined to include treasury notes, commercial bills, transfer- able certificates of deposit, and other marketable securities issued by banks, brokers, etc. The variable deposit require- ment would apply to subscriptions to new issues of fixed- interest securities having a maturity of more than two years. (The restrictions under (4) and (5) would apply only where the funds tendered by or on behalf of an overseas resident were remitted to Australia for this purpose on and after Feb- ruary 2, 1973.) February 12. Dealings in foreign exchange by Australian banks were suspended following the closure of major foreign exchange markets overseas. February 14. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Australia maintained the par value of its currency in terms of gold. The effective parity relation- ship for the U.S. dollar, previously $A 1 = US$1.2750, be- 3 Accounts between Australian companies and their overseas parents, affiliates, associates, and subsidiaries; and between the Australian branches and head offices of companies and their overseas head offices or branches. AUSTRALIA came $A 1 = US$1.4167. New official limits for banks' spot dealings in telegraphic transfers were set at US$1.4191 buy- ing, and US$1.4143 selling, per $A 1. The suspension of foreign exchange dealings was relaxed to allow banks to deal w i th the Reserve Bank in spot U.S. dollars only. Remaining restrictions were w i thdrawn on February 15. March 2. On the closure of foreign exchange markets abroad, the Reserve Bank's foreign exchange dealings with Australian banks were restricted to U.S. dollars, both spot and forward. March 20. The Reserve Bank resumed dealing with Austra- lian banks in sterling, both spot and forward, as well as in U.S. dollars. The past practice of quoting to the banks daily rates for Reserve Bank dealings in Canadian dollars was not resumed. Banks could continue to meet their clients' require- ments in this, as in other currencies, through normal market channels. March 20. Inward investment in real estate was restricted. For the time being, exchange control approval would not normally be given for the purchase of real estate by overseas interests, except for acquisitions purely incidental to other purposes, such as the establishment or expansion of a factory or investment by an individual in a block of land for his own use while employed in Australia or on retirement. In addition, the Government requested overseas interests not to enter into significant commitments to buy real estate for the time being. April 2. Gold producers in Papua New Guinea were ex- empted from the requirement of surrendering newly mined gold to the Reserve Bank of Australia. May 8. The special restrictions on exports to the People's Republic of China, Cuba, North Korea, the U.S.S.R., North Viet-Nam, and certain other Eastern European countries were terminated, except in respect of the supply of warlike materials and atomic energy materials. July 3. The Government announced its intention to liberal- ize the system of tariff preferences for imports from develop- ing countries. The new system would cover all manufactured and semimanufactured products, including processed pri- mary products; initially, the margin of preference would be 10 per cent ad valorem below the general tariff rates, and this margin would be increased until the products were competi- tive on the Australian market. July 18. Effective immediately, the Government announced an across-the-board reduction of 25 per cent in import duties, except for a small number of revenue items and antidumping duties. The 15 per cent preferential margin for goods of New Zealand origin covered by the Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement was maintained. The tariff reductions were officially estimated to have the same impact on prices of dutiable imports as a revaluation of approximately 6 per cent. August 15. The minimum amount of inward capital remit- tance for which banks are required to sight Reserve Bank approval of the underlying transaction before converting in- to Australian currency was reduced from $A 250,000 to $A 50,000. August 21. It was announced in the budget that income tax exemptions for gold mining profits and for 20 per cent of the profits from mining other prescribed minerals would be abol- ished. Dividends paid out of those profits and certain divi- 41 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution AUSTRALIA dends paid out of petroleum mining profits would also cease to be exempt. Subsequently, it was decided to retain the exemptions for mining profits, pending further study, but the exemptions for dividends were withdrawn. September 9. The par value was changed from 1.04360 grams to 1.09578 grams of fine gold per Australian dollar, corresponding to $A 0.810994 = SDR 1. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously $A 1 = US$1.4167, became $A 1 = US$1.4875. The market rate for the U.S. dollar was set at the latter level, with the official limits for banks' spot dealings at US$1.4900 and US$1.4850, respectively, per $A 1. September 9. The Reserve Bank changed its official buying price for newly mined gold from $A 29.80 to $A 28.38 a fine ounce. September 10. It was announced that meat was being ex- cluded from the export incentive schemes. October 1. A special tax on meat exports was introduced. October 10. Legislation was introduced to pave the way for the establishment of a separate Papua New Guinea banking system. The effect would be to withdraw the application to Papua New Guinea, at a date to be agreed with the Papua New Guinea Government, of the Reserve Bank Act, the Banking Act, and the Commonwealth Banks Act. This legis- lation was enacted on October 26. By virtue of declarations by the Treasurer, the Reserve Bank Act and the Banking Act ceased to apply to Papua New Guinea on November 1, 1973 and the Commonwealth Banks Act on April 22, 1974. October 25. The Treasurer announced that the Taxation Office had begun screening exchange control applications for all transactions between Australia and the New Hebrides. Approvals were not being given to transactions between com- panies and persons in Australia and the New Hebrides unless the Reserve Bank sighted evidence that the Commissioner of Taxation did not object to the proposed transaction. Further- more, all exchange control applications to make portfolio investments abroad in tax havens were now being screened. October 26. The variable deposit requirement applicable to borrowings from abroad was increased from 25 per cent to 33% per cent. Drawings under loan agreements already ap- proved by the Reserve Bank were not affected. October 29. The Government announced that it did not wish to see foreign ownership in the mining industry go be- yond the existing level. In the field of energy resources, in particular, full Australian ownership in development projects involving uranium, oil, natural gas, and black coal was seen as a desirable objective, although a lower level of Australian participation was acceptable in exploration for these miner- als; for other minerals a more flexible approach would be taken. November 1. The Bank of Papua New Guinea was estab- lished as the central bank of Papua New Guinea. All transac- tions between Australia and Papua New Guinea were exempted from exchange control in either direction. (It was subsequently proposed that exchange control would be intro- duced on transactions by Australian residents with residents of Papua New Guinea when Australian currency would cease to be legal tender in Papua New Guinea.) Australian currency would, for the time being, continue to be the currency of Papua New Guinea, which would issue its own currency as soon as practicable but not before December 1974. December 4. Exports of petroleum products, including fuel supplies for foreign transport, were made subject to restric- tions. December 11. Legislation was introduced to provide the basis for examination and, as necessary, regulation of the activities of certain nonbank financial institutions. The Trea- surer indicated that the Reserve Bank was administering ex- change control on the basis of the Government's policy that it did not generally favor the establishment of new foreign nonbank financial institutions and of the general objective of preventing increases in foreign ownership and control of ex- isting institutions. December 11. Section 26 AAA of the Income Tax Assess- ment Act received royal assent. It provided that any profits received from the purchase and sale of assets within 12 months would be taxed as income. December 11. Legislation was introduced to place beyond doubt the arrangements announced by the Treasurer on Oc- tober 25 for taxation screening of exchange control applica- tions involving tax havens. This legislation came into effect on December 17. December 13. The Treasurer announced that legislation would be introduced early in 1974 to give legislative effect to the Government's policy that it did not generally favor the establishment in Australia of new insurance companies by foreign interests. (The legislation would be nondiscrimina- tory, as it would give the Treasurer equal power to refuse permission for the establishment of new insurance companies by local interests.) December 18. The Government announced an export in- centives scheme, to operate for five years from July 1974. December 31. The Companies (Foreign Take-Overs) Act of November 2, 1972 expired. It was extended until Decem- ber 31, 1974. 42 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution AUSTRIA 1 Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.0359059 gram of fine gold per Austrian Schilling, which corresponds to S 24.75 = SDR 1. Austria has notified the Fund that the rate for the Austrian schil- ling is S 1 = SDR 0.0423597, corresponding to S 23.6073 = SDR 1, but no announced margins are maintained for any currency. In practice, and without having assumed any for- mal obligations in this respect, the authorities observe the margins of 2% per cent either side of cross-parities applicable under the European common margins arrangements. On De- cember 31, 1973, the authorized banks' buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were S 19.80 and S 19.90, respec- tively, per US$1. Forward premiums and discounts are, in principle, left to the interplay of market forces. Austria formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from Au- gust 1, 1962. Administration of Control The Austrian National Bank administers exchange control and issues exchange licenses where required. Most exchange transactions pass through Austrian banks authorized to im- plement the exchange control regulations. The customs issue freely and without delay licenses re- quired for imports of liberalized goods. Licenses, if required, for other imports and for exports have to be obtained from the competent ministry, viz., the Federal Ministry of Trade, Commerce, and Industry (Licensing Office) or the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Prescription of Currency Settlements with all countries may be made either in con- vertible currencies or through Free Schilling Accounts. The exchange control regulations generally are based on the dis- tinction between "multilateral member countries" (IMF or OECD members with which settlements take place in con- vertible currencies) and "multilateral nonmember countries" (other countries with which settlements are made in convert- ible currencies). Nonresident Accounts There are three categories of nonresident accounts in schil- lings: Free Schilling Accounts, Interim Accounts for nonresi- dents residing in member countries of the IMF or the OECD, and Blocked Accounts for nonresidents residing in other countries. Free Schilling Accounts may be freely credited with pro- ceeds from the sale of gold coins or convertible currencies by a nonresident to the Austrian National Bank, or to an autho- rized bank, provided that the conversion serves to make a current payment to a resident, as well as with payments per- mitted by the National Bank on the basis of a general or 1 In view of a change that took place on January 1, 1974 (see note at the end of this survey), this survey presents the position on that date. individual authorization. The accounts may be freely debited for payments to Austrian residents, who must, however, ap- ply for individual licenses if they are to receive loans from nonresidents or if the nonresident's payment serves to finance direct investment in Austria, the purchase of Austrian securi- ties in Austria, or the purchase of real estate in Austria. Balances may be freely converted into any foreign currency. Transfers between these accounts are free. Blockedand Interim Accounts consist of funds that are due to nonresidents. General licenses permit their use for pay- ments for many current and some capital transactions. The transfer abroad of funds in Blocked and Interim Accounts is subject to an individual license. In most cases licenses are granted freely if the funds belong to residents of countries that are members of the IMF or the OECD. Balances in Blocked Accounts exceed by far those in Interim Accounts. Nonresidents may also maintain nonresident accounts in convertible foreign currencies. These accounts may be debited for the same purposes as Free Schilling Accounts, and subject to the same conditions. Imports and Import Payments All commodities not included in the Annex to the Foreign Trade Law are free of import licensing and may be imported from any country without quantitative restriction. All goods included in the Annex require licenses. Most of these goods are free of quantitative restriction. For many goods licenses are granted by the customs, at the time of clearance, when they are imported from any country other than Rhodesia. 2 Nearly all imports from GATT countries, their associated territories, and some other countries 3 are liberalized. Some nonagricultural imports are admitted under an automatic li- censing procedure when originating in Bulgaria, Czechoslo- vakia, Eastern Germany, Hungary, Poland, or Romania. Nonliberalized imports may be obtained under various proce- dures, namely, state trading, global quotas, bilateral quotas, discretionary licensing, and compensation (barter). State trading covers tobacco in any form, ethyl alcohol, and salt. Global quotas apply to specified imports from GATT coun- tries, except Czechoslovakia and Japan. Discretionary indi- vidual licensing is applicable to all other private imports not covered by the procedures listed above. Licenses are usu- ally granted if the imports concerned do not adversely affect 2 Goods liberalized for import from a given group of countries may be freely imported from any country in the group, provided that the country of exportation and the country of production of the goods involved are in the same group. 3 The full list is as follows: Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Botswana, Brazil, Burma, Burundi, Came- roon, Canada, Central African Republic, Chad, Chile, People's Republic of the Congo, Cuba, Cyprus, Dahomey, Denmark (including Faroe Islands and Greenland), Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Fiji, Finland, France, Gabon, The Gambia, Federal Republic of Germany, Ghana, Greece, Guyana, Haiti, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Ivory Coast, Jamaica, Kenya, Khmer Republic, Korea, Kuwait, Lesotho, Luxem- bourg, Malagasy Republic, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldive Islands, Mali, Malta, Mauritania, Mauritius, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Peru, Portugal, Qatar, Rhodesia, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, Tanzania, Togo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Uganda, U.S.S.R., United Kingdom, United States, Upper Volta, Uruguay, People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, Yugoslavia, Zaire, and Zambia. 43 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution AUSTRIA domestic industries; in many cases, they are issued in accor- dance with quotas established in bilateral trade agreements. Import licenses may not be granted for goods imported under compensation transactions, unless there is no other way of settling payments; at present, trade under such ar- rangements is negligible. Grains, milk and butter, and cattle, pigs, and horses for slaughter and products from these ani- mals for human consumption are imported in accordance with a special system of controls and regulations maintained under the Agricultural Marketing Law. In principle, import licenses are issued only to importers who have received trade licenses. Licenses granted to new importers take into account the amount up to which the corresponding global quota has been utilized. Import licenses are not transferable and are valid for six months, but this period may be extended. Payments for imports from, and originating in, countries with which Austria makes settle- ments in convertible currencies do not require exchange li- censes. Payments for Invisibles With few exceptions, residents are permitted to conclude transactions involving current invisibles with residents of countries that are members of the IMF or the OECD. Excep- tions comprise certain transactions concerning transport, films, and insurance. As to transactions in current invisibles that involve payments to residents of other countries, general licenses cover the majority of these (e.g., freight, commis- sions, and the cost of assembly and repairs); for the remaining transactions, individual licenses are required. The licenses are granted after account is taken of certain considerations, such as the principle of reciprocity and hardship cases. Payments on account of generally authorized invisibles to nonresidents may be made freely, provided that no capital transfer is involved. Other payments abroad up to S 1,000 may be made freely and at any time. The remaining payments to "multilateral nonmember countries" for invisibles require special licenses. Residents traveling to countries with which Austria makes settlements in convertible currencies may buy exchange from authorized banks or take up as short-term advance from nonresidents in multilateral countries up to the equivalent of S 26,000 for each trip. Should a resident require more foreign exchange for traveling, the increase may be authorized by the National Bank. In addition, Austrian residents may arrange for trips abroad through travel agents and pay in schillings to cover expenditures for hotels and food as well as transpor- tation. Persons leaving Austria may take with them S 15,000 in Austrian notes and coins and any amount in foreign notes and coins. Exports and Export Proceeds Licenses for exports regulated under the Foreign Trade Law have to be obtained from the competent ministry. Goods exported under compensation arrangements are subject to licensing by the Federal Ministry of Trade, Commerce, and Industry. For most other exports, licenses are not required. Export licenses are issued with due consideration for the 44 provisions of relevant bilateral trade agreements and the ful- fillment of quotas established in accordance with such agree- ments, and for the needs of the Austrian economy. Export claims exceeding the equivalent of S 26,000 must be declared. Export proceeds may either be surrendered or be deposited in accounts with authorized banks. Such deposits in convertible currencies may be used freely for authorized payments abroad. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles, if not surrendered or deposited in an account with an authorized bank, have to be declared within eight days from the date of collection. They may either be surrendered or be deposited with an authorized bank and subsequently used in the same way as proceeds accruing from exports. Persons entering Austria may bring in Austrian or foreign banknotes and coins without limit. Capital Most inward capital transfers, most transactions that could lead to such inflows, and most borrowing from nonresi- dents are at present restricted. The acquisition by nonresi- dents of Austrian securities, shares or participations in Austrian companies or firms, and Austrian real estate is sub- ject to individual approval by the National Bank. 4 At pres- ent, direct investments by nonresidents normally are permitted only when related to manufacturing or to the im- portation and distribution of foreign goods. Loans and credits extended by nonresidents to residents, including those in schillings from Free Schilling Accounts, at present require prior approval by the National Bank and normally are restricted. Approvals are granted particularly, but not exclusively, for (1) investment credits for producing enterprises and (2) import and export finance. The granting of permissions for commercial credits to finance imports of consumer goods, especially passenger automobiles, is re- stricted. Only loans from nonresident relatives to residents up to S 260,000 a borrower a year are at present licensed freely. The short-term foreign assets and liabilities in convertible currencies of authorized banks are not subject to limitation, but any increase in their schilling liabilities to nonresidents over the level of August 13, 1971 is subject to the provisions of a gentlemen's agreement with the National Bank providing for a supplementary or minimum reserve requirement that sterilizes 75 per cent of such increases. 5 Furthermore, the domestic credit institutions are not to repatriate their liquid foreign currency balances or call in their foreign loans prior to maturity. A number of authorized banks are permitted to accept convertible currencies from abroad for onlending abroad at maturities of up to five years. The Austrian National Bank permits the transfer abroad of (1) proceeds from the liquidation of various foreign invest- 4 However, for sales of Austrian securities by credit institutions to nonresidents the National Bank has granted a general license up to the amount of purchases by each bank from nonresidents (including redemption and amortization) plus a global quota of S 641 million, effective for October 1, 1972-December 31,1973; for the first half of 1974 a new global quota of S 275 million has been set. 8 With effect from March 1, 1974 the base date was changed to Decem- ber 31, 1973. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ments in Austria (shares or participation in Austrian enter- prises, Austrian securities, and real estate in Austria) and (2) repayments by residents of foreign loans and credits. The transfer of funds owned by emigrants, and payments due to nonresidents on account of dowries, inheritances, and settlements under certain agreements between heirs, are per- mitted. Residents may freely grant loans up to the equivalent of S 260,000 a resident lender each year to nonresident rela- tives. Residents are allowed, for purposes of direct investment, to acquire participation rights in foreign companies, associa- tions, and other enterprises, and to establish, acquire, or ex- tend foreign agencies or individually owned firms; earnings accruing from such investment usually may be reinvested. Residents also are permitted to acquire real estate abroad (provided that it is intended for the personal use of the buyer within one year), to grant commercial or investment credits, to grant direct investment loans (provided that the resident can actually exert influence on the management of the nonres- ident enterprise), and, provided that the proceeds of the credit are not used within Austria, to grant credits secured by mort- gages in Austria or abroad. Domestic insurance companies may conclude with nonresidents life insurance contracts in Austria. Transactions and operations mentioned in the three pre- ceding paragraphs are licensed upon documentation, pro- vided that they are concluded with residents of countries that are members of the IMF or the OECD. Residents are allowed to purchase from nonresidents, with- out restriction, foreign securities issued in "multilateral mem- ber countries" and registered on stock exchanges6 and Austrian securities; for foreign securities and Austrian exter- nal bonds, the transactions must be carried out on a spot basis through authorized banks and, with certain exceptions (e.g., in the case of securities listed on the Vienna stock ex- change), the securities purchased must be kept with such banks. Payments for these purchases to nonresidents may be made in convertible currencies. Residents may sell foreign securities and Austrian external bonds to nonresidents only on a spot basis against payment in convertible currencies and, for securities deposited in accordance with the afore-men- tioned provision with Austrian authorized banks, only through such banks. The proceeds of the sale, as well as the foreign exchange obtained as a result of redemption of the foreign securities by the debtor, may be kept on account with an authorized bank. Gold Transactions in gold (excluding jewelry and medallions, which are considered jewelry) are governed by the Foreign Exchange Law. The Austrian National Bank is authorized by this law to deal in gold as defined therein; the Bank has AUSTRIA granted a number of general permissions widely liberalizing the domestic gold trade, but does not itself buy or sell gold or gold coins, except in transactions with monetary authori- ties of other countries or with international financial institu- tions. The Bank has authorized credit institutions, exchange offices, and coin dealers to buy or sell in Austria gold coins that are not legal tender on their own behalf or on behalf of their customers (including nonresidents); the prices are based on those for coins and unmanufactured gold in free markets abroad. A general license also permits other residents to pur- chase and sell among themselves, in Austria and against pay- ment in schillings, gold coins that are not legal tender. The Mint releases certain types of gold coins to authorized credit institutions for resale to the public. Residents may hold gold in any form, including bars, in Austria, and they may acquire in Austria any gold coins that are not legal tender and any gold medals or medallions; furthermore, domestic trad- ing between residents in gold with a fineness of less than 0.585 is unrestricted. With the exception of coins, medals, and gold with a fineness of less than 0.585, the acquisition from resi- dents of gold subject to the Foreign Exchange Law is reserved for the monetary authorities, authorized industrial users, den- tists, and jewelers; the Mint, gold refiners, and jewelers are permitted to trade or exchange among themselves gold in any form. Domestic sales of gold coins that are not legal tender are subject to value-added tax at the general rate of 16 per cent. Where the Foreign Trade Law prescribes import licenses for gold imports (e.g., for gold sheets), the license is either issued by the Ministry of Trade, Commerce, and Industry, which usually grants any license applied for by industrial users, or by the customs office concerned, which issues li- censes automatically for certain gold imports within its com- petence. Where this law does not require an import license (e.g., for the import of gold bars), the Foreign Exchange Law prescribes a license issued by the National Bank covering the purchase of gold; such licenses are issued after consideration of the merits of each case. Exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require authorization by the National Bank; the Bank has issued a general license permitting nonresident trav- elers to take out coins that are not legal tender up to a weight of 200 grams a person a trip, and allowing resident travelers to "multilateral member countries" to export such coins up to a value of S 1,000 a person a trip. The National Bank's imports and exports do not require import, exchange, or export licenses. Commercial imports of jewelry and of articles containing a minor amount of gold, such as watches, are liberalized, licenses being issued automatically by the cus- toms; commercial exports of a number of such articles, how- ever, must be licensed by the Ministry of Trade, Commerce, and Indus t ry. Changes during 1973 8 The general license does not apply to the purchase by residents from nonresidents of securities of a participating na ture in whatever legal form ( inc lud ing shares) that are issued by foreign investment funds or by similar ins t i tu t ions of whatever kind which assemble assets for the purpose of risk spreading. Individual licenses are issued automatically when the purchase takes place on a recognized foreign stock exchange. January 1.

A new trade agreement with Hungary came into force. Restrictions on imports from that country were eased further and Austria undertook to apply full GATT liberaliza- tion by the end of 1974. January 1. Quantitative restrictions on goods of Japanese origin were eased further. January 1. The validity of all existing unilateral tariff re- ductions and temporary exemptions from border tax (intro- duced under the temporary price containment program that began in 1969) was carried over into 1973. January 1. The geographic coverage of the generalized sys- tem of tariff preferences was expanded. January 1. A value-added tax was introduced with a gen- eral rate of 16 per cent. It replaced the general 5V2 per cent turnover tax. The turnover tax rebates on exports were dis- continued. The general rate of value-added tax was applicable also to domestic sales of gold coins that are not legal tender. January 16. The gentlemen's agreement of August 18, 1971 between the National Bank and the credit institutions, which aimed at preventing domestic credit institutions from import- ing liquidity, was extended until May 31, 1973. It called, inter alia, for interest-free deposits with the National Bank equal to 75 per cent of any increase over August 13, 1971 levels in banks' schilling liabilities to nonresidents.7 Also, the credit institutions undertook not to sell foreign currency in order to increase their schilling liquidity, and not to repatriate their foreign assets prior to the maturity date. (The agreement was subsequently extended until the end of 1973, and in Novem- ber 1973 it was again extended until June 30, 1974.) January 16. The credit institutions agreed to extend until June 30, 1973 the gentlemen's agreement under which they had since June 15, 1972 undertaken to either hold abroad or invest in National Bank certificates of deposit additional funds totaling S 1.5 billion. (On May 30,1973, this agreement was extended until the end of 1973, when it expired.) February 13. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Austria changed its central rate from S 23.30 = US$1 to S 20.97 = US$1 and continued to avail itself of wider margins. In terms of SDRs the central rate remained unchanged at S 25.2971 = SDR 1. New upper and lower intervention points were set at S 21.44 and S 20.50 per US$1, respectively. February 13. The upper and lower limits for the Italian lira were suspended. February 15. The upper and lower limits for the Finnish markka, the Portuguese escudo, and the Swedish krona were suspended. March 2. The foreign exchange market was closed. It re- opened on March 19. March 5. The upper and lower limits for the U.S. dollar were suspended, as were those for the Belgian franc, the Danish krone, the deutsche mark, the French franc, the Neth- erlands guilder, the Norwegian krone, and the Spanish pe- seta. 7 With effect from March 1, 1974, the base date was changed to Decem- ber 31, 1973. 46 March 15. Austria notified the Fund that, with effect from March 19, it would not, for the time being, ensure that ex- change rates would be kept within the margins hitherto ob- served for spot exchange transactions between the Austrian schilling and other currencies. It was subsequently an- nounced that Austria would pursue a policy designed to keep its exchange rate broadly stable in terms of a weighted aver- age of the stable currencies of those European industrial countries with which it maintained close trading ties. March 17. It was announced that export industries would be granted tax relief and that improved export credit facilities were under consideration. (On March 30, the Oesterreichi- sche Kontrollbank floated a S 250 million bond issue, the proceeds of which would be used for medium-term export financing.) March 30. Austria communicated to the Fund a new rate for the schilling which the authorities proposed to treat in a manner analogous to the treatment given to central rates. No margins were announced, however. The new rate, S 1 = SDR 0.0404196 or S 24.7405 = SDR 1, became effective on March 29 when Austria, without assuming any formal obliga- tion to do so, observed margins of up to 2V4 per cent either side of the cross-parities in respect of those currencies partici- pating in the European common margins arrangement. This policy continued throughout the year. May 23. Under the gentlemen's agreement with the build- ing societies, the provisions on lending for building purposes were tightened; new contracts with building societies could only be concluded by applicants who had lived in Austria for at least two years (previously, one year). June 1. Upon the expiration of Foreign Exchange An- nouncement DE 3/72, the suspension of the liberalization of inward capital movements was extended until the end of 1973 by Foreign Exchange Announcement DE 5 /73 of May 29; this announcement also made the gratuitous or unrequited acquisition by nonresidents of domestic real estate and all other assets listed in Announcement DE 3 /72 subject to individual license during the same period. June 1. The general license of December 1972, permitting credit institutions to sell a limited amount of domestic securi- ties to nonresidents (based on the gentlemen's agreement between the National Bank and the credit institutions of October 9, 1972 on the restriction of sales of domestic fixed-interest bearing securities), which had expired on May 31, was extended until September 30, 1973. The general license covered the sale of domestic securities to nonresidents up to the amount of purchases from nonresidents (including redemption and amortization) plus a global quota of S 500 million (subquotas were allocated to individual banks); the quota was valid from October 9, 1972 to September 30, 1973. June 1. Loans from nonresident relatives up to S 260,000 a borrower a year again became exempt from restrictive li- censing. June 1. A trade and payments agreement with the Peo- ple's Republic of China came into effect that provided for settlements in convertible currencies. It replaced the agree- ment of November 2, 1972, under which settlements had taken place in schillings. Both countries granted each oth- er's exports most-favored-nation treatment. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution June 21. The U.S.S.R. recognized the Austrian schilling as a freely convertible currency for international settlement pur- poses. As a result, contracts between residents of Austria and the U.S.S.R. could be invoiced in schillings. June 28. A most-favored-nation treaty and a long-term trade and cooperation agreement were signed with Bulgaria. June 29. The foreign exchange market was closed. It re- opened on July 3. July 1. Import procedures for liberalized commodities orig- inating in specified countries were simplified. These goods could now be imported under customs licenses. The countries involved included Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Ger- many, Hungary, and Poland. July 1. Upon the expiration of the bilateral payments agree- ment with Romania, settlements with that country were placed on a convertible currency basis. July 1. Residents were granted a general license permitting them to incur monetary obligations to foreign persons resi- dent in "bilateral countries" in respect of the purchase of commodities (except gold), provided that the country of pur- chase and origin was the same bilateral country to which payment would be made, and provided that the (unchanged) prescription of currency regulations were observed. July 2. Austria notified the Fund that with effect from My 3 the rate for the Austrian schilling would be S 1 = SDR 0.0423597 or S 23.6073 = SDR 1. No margins were announced. August 30. A long-term trade and payments agreement was signed with Eastern Germany. Payments would be put on a convertible currency basis with effect from January 1, 1974 and schilling invoicing would be permitted. Austria would apply full GATT liberalization of imports by January 1,1975. September 18. Austria revoked its OECD reservations on (1) the conclusion of life insurance and other insurance con- tracts and the payment of life insurance premiums, (2) taxes on and tax deductability of life insurance and other insurance premiums, and (3) insurance relating to goods in interna- tional trade. September 25. A new general license for the sale of domes- tic securities to nonresidents replaced, in slightly modified form, the corresponding general license in effect since June 1, 1973. The global quota was increased to S 641 million, to be valid until December 31, 1973. AUSTRIA November 29. Agreement was reached between the Na- tional Bank and the credit institutions that the principal mea- sures contained in the stabilization program of November 1972 would be extended from December 31, 1973 until June 30, 1974, including the suspension of the liberalization of inward capital movements. The credit controls, however, would be made more flexible. The gentlemen's agreement calling for the banks to hold abroad or invest in Austrian National Bank certificates of deposit additional funds totaling S 1.5 billion would be termi- nated with effect from December 31, 1973, while the agree- ment calling for a supplementary minimum reserve deposit of 75 per cent against any increase in banks' schilling liabilities to nonresidents and calling for banks to abstain from the conversion of foreign currency or the advance repatriation of foreign assets, was extended until June 30, 1974. November 30. It was announced that, with effect from Jan- uary 1, 1974, settlements with Eastern Germany were being placed on a convertible currency basis, with the exception of those in respect of contracts concluded before that date and expressed in clearing currency; the latter type of settlements would until December 31, 1975 be channeled through the clearing account in schillings at the Oesterreichische Kon- trollbank. December 14. The suspension of the liberalization of in- ward capital movements was extended from January 1, 1974 until June 30, 1974 by Foreign Exchange Announcement DE 8/73. December 27. A new general license regarding the sale of domestic securities to nonresidents replaced the correspond- ing general license in effect since October 1, 1973. A new global quota of S 275 million was set for the first half of 1974. NOTE.—The following change took place early in 1974: January 1. Following the expiration of the payments agree- ment with Eastern Germany, settlements with all countries took place in convertible currencies. The exchange control regulations henceforth distinguished two groups of countries, "multilateral member countries" and "multilateral nonmem- ber countries"; the exchange control concept of "bilateral countries" was eliminated. 47 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BAHAMAS Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.736662 gram of f ine gold per Bahamian Dollar, which corresponds to B$ 1.20635 = SDR 1 or B$l = US$1, and the Bahamas avails itself of wider margins. The U.S. dollar circulates concurrently with the Bahamian dollar. The Bahamas Monetary Authority deals only in U.S. dollars and pounds sterling, and only with commercial banks. It buys U.S. dollars at par and charges a commission of V2 of 1 per cent when selling. It buys sterling at the London market mid-closing rate against the U.S. dollar and charges a com- mission of l/2 of 1 per cent on this mid-rate when selling. For transactions in transfers and drafts with the public, banks are authorized to charge a commission of freight, ships1 disbursements, commissions, royalties, interest on Bahamian assets, and insurance payments. Residents are entitled to a foreign currency travel allowance of the equiva- lent of B$ 1,000 a person a year for tourist travel and of B$5,000 a person a year for genuine business or professional travel.8 The amount of B$ 1,000 for tourist travel excludes the cost of fares and travel services, which are normally obtained against payment in Bahamian dollars to a travel agent in the Bahamas. Applications for foreign exchange in excess of these amounts must be referred to the Monetary Authority, which approves all bona fide applications. Foreign exchange facili- ties obtained for travel may not be retained abroad for use on a journey or be used abroad for other purposes; any unused balance must be surrendered within one month of issue or, if the traveler is still abroad, within one month of his return to the Bahamas. Subject to adequate documentary evidence, an education allowance of up to B$6,000 a person an academic year is normally given upon application to authorized dealers. Applications for facilities in excess of this amount have to be referred to the Monetary Authority. Furthermore, an allow- ance for family support up to B$3,000 a year a remitter is granted. Temporary residents may remit all their wages and salaries which are in excess of their need in the Bahamas. There are no restrictions on the export of coins expressed in any currency, but in principle the export by travelers of domestic banknotes is limited to B$70 and of foreign cur- rency notes to the equivalent of B$ 1,000; in practice these limits are not enforced. Exports and Export Proceeds No export licenses are required except for crawfish and arms and ammunition. The proceeds of exports must be of- fered for sale to an authorized dealer as soon as the goods have reached their destination or within six months of ship- ment; alternatively, export proceeds may be used in any man- ner satisfactory to the Monetary Authority. The surrender requirements are seldom enforced. Proceeds from Invisibles Residents are obliged to collect without delay all amounts due to them from nonresidents and to offer the foreign cur- rency proceeds for sale to an authorized dealer without delay, but these requirements are seldom enforced. There are no restrictions on the import of domestic or foreign banknotes. Capital All capital transfers to countries outside the Bahamas re- quire exchange control approval and outflows of resi- dent-owned capital are restricted. Inward transfers do not require exchange control approval, although the subsequent utilization of the funds in the Bahamas may require authori- zation. The permission of the Monetary Au thor i ty is required in respect of any act whereby nonresidents acquire control of an incorporated company controlled by residents. Resident individuals and companies require the specific permission of e Temporary residents are eligible for business travel allowances but not for other travel allowances. BAHAMAS the Monetary Authority to maintain bank accounts outside the Bahamas.7 The use of official exchange for outward direct investment is limited to B$ 150,000 or 50 per cent of the total cost of the investment, whichever is greater, for investments from which the additional benefits expected to accrue to the balance of payments from export receipts, profits, or other earnings within 18 months of the investment, will at least equal the total amount of investment and continue thereafter. Invest- ments in excess of B$l 50,000 must be financed by investment currency or by foreign currency borrowed on suitable terms, subject to individual approval by the Monetary Authority. Projects which do not meet the above criteria may be financed by foreign currency borrowing, the purchase of foreign cur- rency in the investment currency market, or the use of re- tained profits of foreign subsidiary companies. Permission is not given for projects which are likely to have adverse effects on the balance of payments. Inward investment by nonresidents in principle is unre- stricted. However, the consent of the Monetary Authority is required for the issue or transfer of shares in a Bahamian company to a nonresident and for the transfer of control of a Bahamian company to a nonresident. Where the investment takes the form of a purchase of real property, the nonresident must obtain permission. Such permission is normally granted, provided that a fair price is paid, and payment may be made either in Bahamian dollars from an External Ac- count or in foreign currency. In order to obtain "approved status" from the Monetary Authority, inward direct investment must be registered with the Registrar's Office. For all investments with approved status, permission is automatically given for the transfer of profits and dividends, representing earned trading profits and investment income. In the event of a sale or liquidation, non- resident investors are permitted to repatriate the proceeds, including any capital appreciation, through the official for- eign exchange market. Residents require the specific approval of the Monetary Authority to buy property outside the Bahamas; such pur- chases, if for personal use, can only be made with investment currency, and approval is limited to one property for each family. Any incidental expenses connected with the purchase of property for personal use may normally be met with invest- ment currency; expenditures necessary to preserve the prop- erty, or arising directly from its ownership, may with permission be met with foreign currency bought at the cur- rent market rate in the official foreign exchange market. The transfer of legacies and inheritances due to nonresident beneficiaries under wills or intestacies of persons who were Bahamian residents at the time of their death is permitted. However, permission is not normally given for Bahamian residents to settle any property, other than by will, for the benefit of nonresidents. A resident may make cash gifts to nonresidents not exceed- ing a total of B$ 1,000 a donor each year. This amount may be exceeded, with permission, in special circumstances. 7 Banks and trusts established in the Bahamas are exempt from certain exchange control regulations, particularly with regard to their offshore operations. 49 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BAHAMAS Foreign nationals domiciled in the Bahamas, even if con- sidered resident for exchange control purposes, may be eligi- ble for a measure of exemption from certain exchange control obligations, notably with respect to the mandatory deposit of foreign currency securities and the surrender of certain other foreign capital assets. Bahamian securities may be purchased and sold freely by all persons, irrespective of residence, through authorized agents. 8 Nonresident buyers of Bahamian securities must pay for such purchases in Bahamian dollars from an External Account, in funds eligible for credit to an External Account, or in Bahamian dollars arising from the sale of foreign cur- rency in the official foreign exchange market; interest, divi- dends, and capital payments on such securities are not remitted outside the Bahamas unless the holdings have been properly acquired by nonresidents. Bahamian residents are not permitted to purchase foreign currency securities with official exchange nor out of export proceeds or other current earnings; payment must be made with investment currency. All purchases, sales, and switches of foreign currency securi- ties in the Bahamas and all switches of foreign currency secu- rities by Bahamian residents, wherever the switch takes place, require permission from the Monetary Authority, and all transactions must take place through authorized agents. All foreign securities purchased by residents of the Bahamas must be held to the order of an authorized agent. Securities of other Sterling Area countries are considered foreign cur- rency securities, and sales proceeds of such securities held by residents, if registered at the Monetary Authority by Decem- ber 31, 1972, are eligible for sale in the investment currency market; securities not properly registered may be offered for sale at the official rate of exchange. Residents leaving the country with the intention of residing outside the Bahamas permanently are redesignated upon de- parture as nonresidents. Under normal rules a family (or an individual), leaving the Bahamas to take up residence else- where may transfer at the current market rate in the official foreign exchange market, up to B$25,000 of its (his) Baha- mian dollar assets to the new country of residence, and may also take normal household and personal effects with them. Where the total value of their Bahamian dollar assets is over B$25,000, the excess is transferable through the official ex- change market after four years or through the investment currency market at any time. After a person's redesignation as a nonresident, income accruing from his assets remaining in the Bahamas is normally remittable at the current market rate in the official foreign exchange market. Residents other than authorized banks require permission to borrow foreign currency from nonresidents, and autho- rized dealers are subject to exchange control directions with regard to their lending of foreign currency to residents. Resi- dents also require permission to pay interest on, and to repay the principal of, foreign currency loans through the conver- sion of Bahamian dollars. Where permission is granted for residents to accept foreign currency loans, such permission is normally conditional upon the currency being offered for sale without delay to an authorized dealer, unless the funds are 8 These are ten banks, trust companies, and others authorized to deal in Bahamian and foreign currency securities, and to receive securities in deposit. 50 required to meet payments to nonresidents for which permis- sion has been specifically given. A resident company which is wholly owned by nonresi- dents of the Bahamas is not normally allowed to raise work- ing capital in Bahamian dollars unless such funds are a small proportion of the total investment. If the company is partly owned by nonresidents, approval of such local currency bor- rowing is determined on a basis pro rata to the nonresident interest in the equity of the company. Banks and other lenders resident in the Bahamas require permission before they make loans in domestic currency to any body corporate (other than a bank), which is resident in the Bahamas and is by any means controlled, whether directly or indirectly, by nonresidents. However, companies which are set up by nonresidents pri- marily to import and distribute products manufactured out- side the Bahamas are not normally allowed to borrow Bahamian dollars from residents either for fixed or working capital but must provide all their finance in foreign currency; borrowings in a foreign currency normally are permitted on application. Generally, authorized dealers may provide credit in Baha- mian dollars to nonresidents for up to 180 days when it is by way of documentary bills in respect of current shipments of goods between the Bahamas and the rest of the world. They may also provide credit to nonresidents for up to nine months to finance the import into the Bahamas within that period of primary products where this has been traditional. Foreign currency deposited with authorized dealers may be on-lent to nonresidents for any purpose. Gold Residents of the Bahamas other than authorized dealers are not permitted to hold or deal in gold bullion. Those residents, however, who are known users of gold for industrial purposes may, with the approval of the Monetary Authority, meet their current industrial requirements. Import licenses are freely issued by the Monetary Authority to industrial users. Autho- rized dealers are not required to obtain licenses for bullion or coins. Commercial imports of gold jewelry do not require a license. There is no import duty on gold bullion or gold coins; however, an import duty of 10 per cent is imposed on gold jewelry imports from Commonwealth countries (30 per cent for other countries), and a 7% per cent stamp tax payable to the customs is levied on gold jewelry from any source. There is no restriction on the acquisition or retention by residents of gold coins. The Bahamas has issued gold coins in denomi- nations of B$10, B$20, B$50, and BS100; these are legal tender but do not circulate. Changes during 1973 February 15. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the par value was changed from 0.843828 gram to 0.736662 gram of fine gold per Bahamian dollar, corresponding to B$ 1.20635 = SDR 1. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar was restored to the level that existed between February 1970 and December 1971, i.e., B$l = US$1.

The Bahrain Currency Board quotes daily rates for sterling based on London rates for the U.S. dollar against sterling. On December 31, 1973, the Currency Board's buy ing and selling rates for sterling were BD 0.912 and BD 0.922 per £ stg. 1, respectively. In their dealings w i th the public, com- mercial banks are required to observe the Currency Board's rates, but they are authorized to charge up to BD 0.005 per £ stg. 1, buy ing and selling. The banks' rates for other curren- cies are based on the Currency Board's rates for sterling and the London market rates for the currencies concerned against sterling. On December 31, 1973, their buy ing and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were BD 0.3905 and BD 0.39925, respec- t ive ly, per US$1. The Currency Board does not deal with the public. Bahrain formally accepted the obligations of Article V I I I, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement on March 20, 1973. Administration of Control There is neither exchange control legislation nor an ex- change control au tho r i ty in Bahrain. Bahrain has ceased to be a Scheduled Territory in terms of the U .K. Exchange Control Act, 1947 but under current U .K. exchange control regula- tions continues to be regarded as a country of the Overseas Sterling Area. Payments of Unreasonable amounts" to desti- nations outside the Sterling Area may be examined by the banks a n d / or the Currency Board on a discretionary basis. In practice, however, outward payments are not restricted. Import and export licenses are issued by the Bahrain Cham- ber of Commerce. Prescription of Currency All settlements w i th Israel and Rhodesia are prohibited. Otherwise, no requirements are imposed on exchange pay- ments or receipts. Nonresident Accounts No distinction is made between accounts held by residents and those held by nonresidents. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Israel and Rhodesia are prohibited, as are products manufac tured by foreign companies that have been blacklisted by the Arab League. Imports of a few commodi- ties are prohibited from all sources for reasons of health, morals, or security; imports of cultured pearls also are pro- hibited. Import licenses are required only for arms and am- mun i t ion, television cameras, alcoholic beverages, and used buses. Three commodities, namely, rice, sugar, and cement, can only be imported by the Bahrain Import-Export Com- 52 pany. Exchange for payments in respect of permitted imports may be obtained freely. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments for and proceeds from invisibles are not re- stricted, except that payments must not be made to or re- ceived from Israel or Rhodesia. Travelers may bring in or take out of Bahrain any amount in domestic or foreign bank- notes. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Israel and Rhodesia are prohibited and ex- ports of certain refined petroleum products to the Nether- lands, Portugal, South Africa, and the United States have been suspended. Otherwise, all commodities may be exported freely. There are no requirements attached to receipts from exports or re-exports; the proceeds need not be repatriated or surrendered, and they may be disposed of freely, regardless of the currency involved. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or payments by residents or nonresidents, but no payments may be made to or received from Israel or Rhode- sia. Profits from foreign investments in Bahrain may be trans- ferred abroad freely. Gold Residents may freely and without a license purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home and abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form are freely permitted and do not require a license. Imports of gold jewelry are subject to a 10 per cent customs du ty but gold ingots are exempt. Changes during 1973 February 12. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the gold parity of the Bahrain dinar was maintained at 1.86621 grams of fine gold. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar was changed from BD 1 = US$2.28 to BD 1 = US$2.53. March 20. Bahrain notified the Fund that it formally ac- cepted the obligations of Article V I I I, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. March 31. An initial par value was established of 1.86621 grams of f ine gold per Bahrain dinar, corresponding to BD 0.476190 = SDR 1 or BD 0.394737 = US$1. Bahrain availed itself of wider margins. October 21. Exports of certain refined oil products to the United States were suspended. On October 31 such exports to the Netherlands and South Africa also were suspended, and on December 30 those to Portugal. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution October 31. The Bahrain Import-Export Company was es- ttblished with government participation. It was given a mo- nopoly over the import of rice, sugar, and cement. December 5. The Bahrain Monetary Agency was estab- lished. It would replace the Bahrain Currency Board and perform the functions of a central bank. BAHRAIN 53 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BANGLADESH Exchange Rate System No par value for the Bangladesh currency, the Taka, has been established with the Fund. The official exchange rate is Tk 18.9677 = £ stg. 1, and the currency is floating with sterling. Exchange rates for currencies other than sterling, the Indian rupee, and other currencies directly linked to sterling, are based on the London market rates for the currencies concerned. On December 31, 1973, the spot buying and sell- ing rates of the Bangladesh Bank (the central bank) vis-a- vis authorized dealers were Tk 18.7501 per £ stg. 1 and Tk 18.8501 per £ stg. 1, respectively. On December 31, 1973, the spot buying and selling rates (telegraphic transfers) of au- thorized dealers were Tk 18.7143 per £ stg. 1 and Tk 18.8857 per £ stg. 1, respectively. On the same date, the central bank's spot buying and selling rates for the Indian rupee were Tk 100.00 and Tk 100.05, respectively, per Rs 100, and the corresponding rates of the commercial banks were Tk 99.95 and Tk 100.10 per Rs 100. A buying rate of Tk 30 per £ stg. 1 is applicable to certain inward remittances made to their dependent relatives by Ban- gladesh nationals working abroad and not being paid out of Bangladesh resources. Forward transactions of the Bangla- desh Bank are confined to purchases of sterling and U.S. dollars. Forward facilities at authorized banks are available for export proceeds in sterling and U.S. dollars. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Bangladesh Bank in accordance with general policy formulated in consultation with the Ministry of Finance. The three foreign and six do- mestic commercial banks have been appointed authorized dealers (authorized banks). The Chief Controller of Imports and Exports of the Ministry of Commerce and Foreign Trade is responsible for the issuance of import and export licenses. Certain trade transactions are conducted through state trad- ing agencies, including the Trading Corporation of Bangla- desh (TCB) and the Bangladesh Jute Export Corporation. Prescription of Currency Bangladesh has ceased to be a Scheduled Territory in terms of the U.K. Exchange Control Act, 1947 but under current U.K. exchange control regulations continues to be regarded as a country of the Overseas Sterling Area. Settlements with all countries are subject to exchange control. Settlements with countries with which Bangladesh has bilateral payments agreements * normally must be effected through clearing ac- counts specified in the agreements. Settlements in respect of trade with Burma also are made through a special account. As regards other countries, settlements normally take place in sterling and other convertible currencies or through Non- resident Taka Accounts. Payments for imports must be made to the country of origin of the goods (1) in takas for credit to an account in Bangladesh held by a resident of the country 1 Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Egypt, Hungary, India, Poland, Romania, U.S.S.R., and Yugoslavia.

Export proceeds must be received in convertible foreign exchange, 2 in takas from a Nonresident Taka Account, or, provided such funds were generated from the conversion of inward remittances made since December 17, 1971, from balances in the taka accounts of resident foreign companies being maintained with autho- rized dealers. All settlements with Pakistan, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts The accounts of individuals, firms, or companies resident in countries outside Bangladesh are designated Nonresident Accounts. All such accounts are regarded for exchange con- trol purposes as accounts related to the country in which the account holder is permanently residing. 3 Specified debit and credit entries to nonresident accounts may be made by authorized dealers without prior approval of the Bangladesh Bank during the absence of the account holder from Bangladesh. Specified other debits and credits may be made freely irrespective of whether the account holder resides in Bangladesh. Certain other debits and credits may be made without the prior approval of the Bangladesh Bank but subject to reporting ex post. All diplomatic missions operating in Bangladesh, their dip- lomatic officers, home-based members of the mission staffs, and international organizations functioning in Bangladesh and their employees are allowed to maintain a separate type of account, Special Convertible Taka Accounts. These ac- counts may be credited freely with receipts of inward remit- tances in convertible foreign exchange, and may be debited freely and at any time for remittances abroad in convertible currencies and for transfers to Nonconvertible Taka Ac- counts. Transfers between Special Convertible Taka Ac- counts are freely permitted. All other debits and credits require the prior approval of the Bangladesh Bank. New nonresident accounts may be opened only with the prior approval of the Bangladesh Bank. Imports and Import Payments Imports are financed either from Bangladesh's own re- sources or with foreign aid, loans, and barter arrangements. Imports financed from Bangladesh's own resources are li- censed within the framework of a semiannual import policy (import budget). Under the import policy for the "shipping" period, July-December 1973, items permissible for import were classified into three broad categories: (1) consumer goods and raw materials permitted to be imported by "com- mercial importers," including public sector agencies; (2) raw 2 The following are considered convertible foreign currencies: deutsche mark, French francs, Japanese yen, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. 3 The accounts of the United Nations and its organizations, however, are treated as resident accounts. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution materials and packing materials permitted to be imported by "industrial consumers" recognized as such under an entitle- ment system; and (3) items permitted to be imported exclu- sively by the TCB or jointly by the TCB and private sector importers. The list of commodities that could be imported under this import policy comprised some 400 items; no provi- sion was made for commercial imports of any other goods, whose importation, therefore, was de facto prohibited unless financed by foreign aid. Imports from Pakistan, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. All imports require licenses. Single country licenses are issued for imports under bilateral trade or payments arrange- ments and for most aid imports. Other import licenses are valid world-wide, except for Pakistan, Rhodesia, and South Africa. Licenses issued to commercial importers are valid for a period of six months from the date of issuance. There is a registry of commercial importers, and items they are permit- ted to import are specified. Licenses are normally issued to commercial importers for importation of one item only, but where an importer is eligible to import more than one item, the total value of licenses could not exceed Tk 20,000 during the July-December 1973 "shipping" period; licenses issued under bilateral trade or payments arrangements were not counted toward this limit. Licenses are not transferable, and when they expire are not normally revalidated except where, owing to circumstances beyond the control of importers, the letter of credit requirement could not be met or shipping arrangements could not be made. Irrevocable letters of credit must be opened within three months from the date of issuance of licenses. Many imports are reserved for the TCB, including certain chemical and metal products, cement, sugar, certain cotton textiles, and woolen fabrics. In addition, the importa- tion of a number of items is reserved exclusively to other public sector agencies; these include airplane parts, trucks, fire engines, bus and truck chassis, coal and coke, cinemato- graphic films, certain cotton textiles, edible oil, fertilizers, insecticides, and wood and timber. There are limited facilities outside the import program for minor imports by specified end-users, such as hospitals and educational or technical in- stitutions. The licensing of imports of specified raw materials and packing materials by industrial consumers is governed by an entitlement system, based on the requirements for various industries during each "shipping" period as established by the Director-General of Industries. Firms in the industrial sectors are given an entitlement for importation of specified raw materials and packing materials, and licenses are issued on the basis of the entitlement. Separately, industrial consumers may be granted import licenses for parts and accessories of machinery. Goods imported against licenses issued to indus- trial consumers must be used in the industry concerned and must not be sold or transferred without prior approval. Under a raw material replenishment scheme aimed at en- couraging industrial exports, industries engaged in export business, or with export potential, may receive licenses in excess of their normal entitlement for the importation of their raw material requirements, on the basis of their export per- formance. Licenses issued under the scheme have to be BANGLADESH claimed within six months of the realization of the export proceeds and are not transferable. Foreign exchange for licensed imports is provided auto- matically by authorized dealers when payments are due. Ad- vance payments for imports require approval by the Bangladesh Bank, which normally is given only for special- ized or capital goods. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles connected with authorized trade transactions generally are not restricted. Payments for most other invisibles require prior approval and are restricted. Lit- tle foreign exchange is provided for tourist travel. Applica- tions for foreign exchange for business travel and medical treatment abroad are considered on an individual basis; as a rule, the amount granted is £ stg. 75 for two weeks of business travel, and about £ stg. 400 for medical treatment. Foreign nationals working in Bangladesh must obtain approval before making remittances abroad for family maintenance purposes; such approval is usually granted for 50 per cent of wages or salaries, subject to a maximum of £ stg. 150 a month (net of tax) if the terms of employment have been approved by the Government. Nonresident travelers may take out foreign currency and travelers checks they declared on entry less the amount sold to authorized dealers or money changers; they may also, without obtaining the approval of the Bangladesh Bank, re- convert taka notes up to Tk 150 into convertible foreign currencies. Resident travelers may take out foreign currency and travelers checks up to the amount of any travel allocation they have been granted. Bangladesh nationals may take out Tk 20 in domestic currency; otherwise, the export of Bangla- desh currency notes and coins is prohibited. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Pakistan, Rhodesia, and South Africa are pro- hibited. The Bangladesh Jute Export Corporation has a mo- nopoly over the export of raw jute. The proceeds from exports of jute goods and tea must be received within six months of shipment, those from exports of perishable goods to India within two months of shipment, and those from other exports within four months of shipment. Exporters of 79 items receive a cash subsidy equivalent to 30 per cent of the net f.o.b. value. In addition, certain export industries are granted incentives through a Raw Materials Replenishment Scheme. Proceeds from Invisibles All proceeds from invisibles must be surrendered. Remit- tances in convertible currencies made to their dependent rela- tives by Bangladesh nationals working abroad and not receiving payment out of Bangladesh resources are accorded a premium resulting in an effective buying rate of Tk 30 per £ stg. 1. The import of Bangladesh currency notes and coins is pro- hibited. Foreign currency travelers checks and foreign cur- rency notes may be brought in by nonresident travelers 55 ©International Monetary Fund.

Capital All outward transfers of capital require approval; such approval is not normally granted in respect of resident-owned capital. Inwa rd capital transfers also require approval, which generally is given. All Bangladesh nationals who are resident in Bangladesh must surrender any foreign exchange coming in to their possession, whether held in Bangladesh or abroad, to an authorized dealer within one month of the date of acquisition. Foreign nationals residing in Bangladesh contin- uously for more than six months are required to surrender any foreign exchange representing their earnings abroad in respect of business conducted in Bangladesh or services ren- dered, w i th in one mon th of the date of acquisition. There is no restriction on the importation of securities into Bangladesh, but the transfer of securities in favor of a person resident outside Bangladesh requires approval. This require- ment applies to all Bangladesh securities, whether held by persons resident in Bangladesh or outside Bangladesh, and to all foreign securities held by persons resident in Bangladesh. Approval is given if securities are returned to Bangladesh w i th in a specified period or, if they are sold, if the proceeds are repatriated to Bangladesh. Authorized dealers may obtain short-term loans and over- d r a f ts from overseas branches and correspondents for a pe- riod not exceeding seven days at a time, provided that they are obtained only in the currency of the country or monetary area in which the overseas bank branch or correspondent is situated. Borrowing by nonresident-owned or nonresident-con- trolled enterprises from commercial banks in Bangladesh, as well as from abroad, requires approval, and loans in local currency against overseas guarantees or collateral outside Bangladesh by authorized dealers also require approval. Au- thorized dealers may, however, approve loans, overdrafts, or credit facilities against goods intended for export from Ban- gladesh to companies controlled by persons resident outside Bangladesh. Authorized dealers must obtain approval before making any long-term loans in foreign currencies to residents or nonresidents, whether secured or unsecured. They are not normally permitted to hold short-term foreign assets other than small working balances. Under the Industrial Investment Policy promulgated on January 8, 1973, joint ventures with foreign investors are permitted only with the participation of the Government, and the foreign share of the equity cannot exceed 49 per cent. Foreign investors are expected to provide the entire amount of the foreign exchange component of the project concerned. If this component exceeds 49 per cent of the equity, the excess foreign exchange has to be provided by the foreign investor through loans, on terms and conditions to be mutually nego- tiated. Foreign participation in the private sector (defined as private enterprises w i th fixed assets not exceeding Tk 2.5 million, although expansion of assets up to Tk 3.5 million through reinvestment of profits is allowed), however, is re- stricted to the provision of licenses and patents only, without 56 equity participation. All foreign investments require approval by the Investment Board. Under this policy, dividends on foreign capital can be re- mitted net of tax. No provisions are made for a tax holiday. Also remittable are 50 per cent of the net salary of foreign nationals, up to a maximum of £150 a month a person, and savings from earnings, retirement benefits, and personal as- sets on termination of services or retirement. Repatriation of foreign capital, including capital gains and profits reinvested within the first ten years from the commencement of produc- tion, may take place over a period of ten years. Government guarantees against nationalization are provided for a period of ten years, and in the event of nationalization after ten years, compensation is to be paid on a fair and equitable basis. Gold The import and export of gold or silver in any form is prohibited without special permission, which is not normally granted. There are no restrictions on the internal sale, pur- chase, or possession of gold or silver ornaments (including coins) and jewelry, but there is a prohibition on the holding of gold and silver in any other form except by licensed indus- trialists or dentists. Changes during 1973 January 1. The import policy for the first half of 1973 came into effect. The public sector was allocated 70 per cent of total imports. The ban on luxury imports was continued. The amount of licenses available to individual commercial import- ers was increased from a maximum of Tk 20,000 to Tk 35,000. Import licenses for raw materials and spare parts were to be issued to pharmaceutical industries at 200 per cent of their entitlement and to all other industries at 100 per cent of their entitlement. Export incentives were to be granted by the issue of additional licenses to export industries according to their performance. Repeat licenses would be issued to importers of such essential items as milk and other food items and medi- cines. January 1. A special clearing arrangement for travel expen- ditures was added to the existing payments agreement with India. January 8. An Industrial Investment Policy containing reg- ulations governing inward direct investment was announced. February 12. A bilateral trade and payments agreement with Eastern Germany was signed; it came into effect imme- diately. February 20. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the effective parity relationship for sterling was maintained unchanged at Tk 18.9677 = £ stg. 1 and the taka continued to float with sterling. February 26. Authorized dealers were given general author- ity to credit nonresident accounts with the proceeds of inward remittances under the Premium Scheme (inclusive of the amounts of premiums) and to debit these accounts for local disbursements. May 8. All outstanding import licenses against which let- ters of credit had not been established had to be revalidated. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution May 26. The importation of certain cotton textiles, which hitherto was reserved for the Trade Corporation of Bangla- desh, was again permitted also for the private sector. July 1. The premium payments scheme for certain person- al inward remittances was extended for another year. The conversion rate was maintained unchanged at Tk 30 per £ s t g. 1. July 5. A "two-tier agreement" including a "balanced trade and payments agreement" was signed with India. It came into effect on September 28, 1973, when the trade and payments agreement of March 28, 1972 expired. Trade between the two countries in listed commodities was placed on a balanced basis for a period of three years; such trade was to be settled through special accounts at two designated banks. Other trade with India would henceforth be settled in sterling or other convertible currencies. Operating instructions were is- sued on July 16, to cover operations from September 28 on. July 30. A broad outline of the import policy for the second half of 1973 was announced. The public sector was allocated 82 per cent of total imports. The ban on luxury imports was BANGLADESH continued, but the import of a number of essential consumer goods (e.g., cloth and yam, drugs and medicines, sugar, edi- ble oil, oilseeds, coconut oil, coal, cement, and books and periodicals) was permitted on a priority basis. Essential in- dustries were to receive licenses for imports of raw materials and spare parts at the ratio of 100 per cent of their semiannual entitlement. The Raw Materials Replenishment Scheme for export industries was to be continued. The minimum value of licenses to be issued to commercial importers was increased to Tk 10,000. Some items were transferred from the TCB's list of monopoly imports to the list of private sector imports, and several other items were shifted in the opposite direction. November 3. An export subsidy scheme was announced. Under the scheme exporters of 79 items would receive a cash subsidy amounting to 30 per cent of the net f.o.b. value of exports after shipment of the goods and within 30 days of the surrender of the foreign exchange proceeds. The scheme was made retroactive to July 27, and would be in force until June 30, 1974. December 31. The import policy for the first half of 1974 was announced. 57 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BARBADOS Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.444335 gram of fine gold per Barbados Dollar, corresponding to BDS 2 = SDR 1, but no exchange transactions take place at the par value. The Central Bank of Barbados maintains a fixed relationship for the Barbados dollar with sterling at the rate of BDS 4.80 = £ stg. 1. Consequently, all exchange transactions other than those in sterling or currencies linked to sterling take place at fluctuat- ing rates. The Central Bank is authorized to levy a commission charge of up to 1 per cent on inward and outward transfers of sterling. On December 31, 1973, the commission charges in transactions with authorized banks were 5/16 of 1 per cent on inward transfers and % of 1 per cent on outward transfers. The authorized banks apply the same commission charges in dealings in sterling with their customers, although they may levy an additional charge on mail transfers and drafts. The Central Bank maintains fixed buying and selling rates at % of 1 per cent either side of parity for the Guyana dollar and the Trinidad and Tobago dollar, while for the Jamaica dollar the Central Bank's buying and selling rates are determined on the basis of the prevailing sterling/U.S. dollar rate. The au- thorized banks apply commission charges for these currencies of % of 1 per cent, buying and selling. Exchange rates for convertible non-Sterling Area currencies are based on the daily buying and selling rates in the London market. On December 31, 1973, the authorized banks' buying rates for the U.S. dollar were BDS 202.8 for banknotes and BDS 204.5 for checks, respectively, per US$100; their selling rate was BDS 209.5 per US$100. Under an arrangement with the central banks of Guyana, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago, the Central Bank of Bar- bados purchases notes and coins issued by the monetary authorities of those countries and repatriates the currency in return for reciprocity of treatment with respect to collections of Barbados dollars. The currencies of Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago are purchased at the parity rates of BDS 0.9211 per Guyana dollar and BDS 1.00 per Trinidad and Tobago dollar; the Jamaica dollar is purchased at the middle rate determined on the basis of the prevailing sterling/U.S. dollar rate. Administration of Control Exchange control applies to all countries outside the Ster- ling Area. * It is administered by the Central Bank of Barba- dos, to which the Minister of Finance and Planning has delegated the performance of his ordinary functions as the Exchange Control Authority. The Central Bank delegates to authorized dealers the authority to approve normal import payments and the allocation of foreign exchange for certain other current payments. The exchange control system pro- vides that foreign exchange should normally be surrendered 1 By an order dated February 28, 1974 exchange control was extended to residents of all Sterling Area countries and to transactions in the currencies of those countries. 58 to an authorized dealer. Trade controls are administered by the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Commerce. Prescription of Currency Barbados has ceased to be a Scheduled Territory in terms of the U.K. Exchange Control Act, 1947 but under current U.K. exchange control regulations continues to be regarded as a country of the Overseas Sterling Area. Settlements with residents of other parts of the Sterling Area 2 may be made in any Sterling Area currency. Authorized payments to resi- dents of countries outside the Sterling Area other than Rho- desia may be made in any non-Sterling Area currency or by crediting an External Account in Barbados dollars. Receipts from residents of countries outside the Sterling Area other than Rhodesia may be received to the debit of an External Account or in any foreign currency. Nonresident Accounts Residents of other Sterling Area countries may maintain accounts in Barbados dollars in Barbados and no distinction is made between these accounts and accounts maintained in Barbados dollars by residents of Barbados. With the permission of the Exchange Control Authority, authorized banks may maintain Foreign Currency Accounts and External Accounts in the names of residents of non-Ster- ling Area countries. Residents of the Sterling Area may also hold Foreign Currency Accounts. Permission to open For- eign Currency Accounts, which are maintained in non-Ster- ling Area currencies, is given on the basis of the anticipated frequency of receipts and payments in foreign currency. Cer- tain receipts and payments may be credited and debited to Foreign Currency Accounts, subject to the conditions of ap- proval at the time the account was opened. Other credits and debits require individual approval. External Accounts may be opene^, with exchange control approval, for nonresidents of the Sterling Area and are main- tained in Barbados dollars. They may be credited with pro- ceeds from the sale of foreign currencies or gold and with transfers from other External Accounts. Other credits require individual approval. They may be debited for payments to residents of the Sterling Area, for transfers to other External Accounts, and, in some cases, for the purchase of non-Ster- ling Area currencies. Other debits require individual ap- proval. The Exchange Control Act, 1967 empowers the Exchange Control Authority to require certain payments in favor of residents of countries outside the Sterling Area which are ineligible for transfer to be credited to Blocked Accounts. Amounts standing to the credit of Blocked Accounts may not be withdrawn without approval, other than for the purchase of approved securities. However, in view of the United King- 2 The Exchange Control Act, 1967 defines the Sterling Area as excluding South Africa. Foreign currencies comprise all non-Sterling Area currencies. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution dom's decision in 1967 to dispense with Blocked Accounts, these provisions of the Act have not been invoked. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Rhodesia and South Africa are prohib- ited and imports originating in the People's Republic of China, the CMEA countries, North Korea, Japan, and Portu- gal require individual licenses. Imports from Japan are kept under review in order to prevent a widening of the trade imbalance with that country and to protect certain local in- dustries. Certain imports are prohibited or are subject to discretionary licensing irrespective of origin. These include passenger automobiles, buses, cement, coffee, tea, cocoa, and goods which compete with domestic products, such as coco- nut oil, live poultry, sugar, beverages, and certain items of clothing. Special licensing arrangements apply to goods origi- nating in other countries of the Caribbean Free Trade Associ- ation (CARIFTA) or in other countries of the Caribbean Common Market; Barbados is a member of both. Imports affected by these requirements include pork, milk, eggs, cer- tain fruits, vegetables, wheat flour, millfeed, and nuts, all of which are licensed to conform with the terms of the protocol laying down the agricultural marketing arrangements for the Caribbean Free Trade Agreement. Individual licenses are re- quired for imports of commodities subject to international commodity agreements, including wheat, rice (which is im- ported only from Guyana in terms of the Barbados-Guyana Rice Agreement), and commodities subject to the provisions of the Oil and Fats Agreement between the Governments of Barbados, Guyana, Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Trinidad and Tobago, and Dominica. All imports not referred to previ- ously are on open general license. Payments for authorized imports are permitted upon appli- cation and submission of documentary evidence (relevant in- voices or customs warrants) to authorized dealers. BARBADOS Sterling Area currencies for encashment only in Sterling Area countries. Residents traveling to destinations outside the Sterling Area may take out notes and coins up to the value of BDS 100 in the currencies of Sterling Area countries and, with exchange control approval, up to BDS 1,000 in the currencies of non-Sterling Area countries. Residents of non-Sterling Area countries may take out any notes and coins which they brought into Barbados. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Rhodesia and South Africa are prohibited and licenses are required for the export of goods to the People's Republic of China, the CMEA countries, North Korea, Ti- bet, and North Viet-Nam. Specific licenses are required for the export of certain goods to any country; these goods in- clude rice, sugar, cement, petroleum products, and turtle shells. Certain goods, including rum, molasses, and confec- tionery, require licenses when exported to non-Sterling Area countries, and licenses are also required for the export of specified goods to any country that is not a member of CARIFTA. These goods include coconuts and coconut oil, lard, and margarine. All other goods may be exported with- out license. Exports are supervised by the Exchange Control Authority to ensure that proceeds in foreign currencies are surrendered within six months from the date of shipment. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles received in foreign currencies must be sold to an authorized dealer. Travelers to Barbados may bring in freely notes and coins denominated in Barbados dollars, East Caribbean dollars, other Sterling Area curren- cies, or non-Sterling Area currencies. Resident travelers are required to sell their holdings of foreign currencies to an authorized dealer upon return to Barbados. Payments for Invisibles Capital Payments for invisibles originating in countries outside the Sterling Area require the approval of the authorities. Except for transactions involving residents of Rhodesia, the follow- ing applies. Payments for all commercial transactions are permitted freely when the application is supported by appro- priate documentary evidence. Authority has been delegated to authorized dealers to provide basic allocations of foreign exchange for certain payments of a personal nature. These include foreign travel, for which up to BDS 1,000 a person may be allocated for each travel year, expenses of education abroad (BDS 2,500 a person a year after the first year), and subscriptions to newspapers, magazines, etc. With the excep- tion of tourism, applications for additional amounts or for purposes for which there is no basic allocation are approved by the authorities, provided that no unauthorized transfer of capital seems to be involved. Applications in respect of tour- ism in excess of BDS 1,000 a person are considered on their merits. Residents of Barbados and other Sterling Area countries may take out unlimited amounts in travelers checks denomi- nated in Barbados dollars, East Caribbean dollars, or other All capital transfers to countries outside the Sterling Area require exchange control approval. Direct investments in non-Sterling Area countries by resi- dents of Barbados require exchange control approval. The purchase by residents of Barbados of non-Sterling Area secu- rities and of real estate for private purposes outside the Ster- ling Area also requires exchange control approval. Certificates of title to non-Sterling Area securities held by residents of Barbados must be lodged with an authorized depository in Barbados and earnings on these securities must be repatriated and surrendered to an authorized dealer. Personal capital transfers such as inheritances to residents of non-Sterling Area countries require exchange control ap- proval, which is granted subject to the payment of estate and succession duties. Dowries in the form of settlements, and cash gifts up to BDS 500 a year may be transferred, with exchange control approval, to residents of countries outside the Sterling Area. Direct investment in Barbados by residents of countries outside the Sterling Area may be made with exchange control approval.

The issuance and transfer to residents of countries outside the Sterling Area of securities registered in Barbados require exchange control approval, which is freely given on condition that an adequate amount of non-Sterling Area currency is brought in for their purchase. Proceeds from the realization of these securities may be remitted when it is established that the original investment was financed from non-Sterling Area currency sources. Residents of countries outside the Sterling Area may acquire in Barbados real estate for private purposes with funds from non-Sterling Area currency sources or a combination of local and non-Sterling Area currency sources. Proceeds from the realization of such investments equivalent to the amount of non-Sterling Area currency brought in may be repatriated freely. Capital sums realized in excess of this amount may be repatriated freely on the basis of a rate of return on the original foreign investment, calculated at the following rates: for the last five years at 8 per cent per annum; for the five years immediately preceding the last five years at 5 per cent; and for any period preceding the last ten years at 4 per cent. Amounts in excess of the sum so derived are restricted to the remittance of BDS 24,000 a year. Authorized banks may freely borrow outside Barbados or accept deposits from persons resident outside Barbados. Gold Residents who are private persons are permitted to acquire and hold gold coins for numismatic purposes only. Other- wise, any gold acquired in Barbados must be surrendered to an authorized dealer unless exchange control approval is ob- tained for its retention. Residents other than the monetary authorities, authorized dealers, and industrial users are not permitted to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry or coins for numismatic purposes. Imports and ex- ports of gold by residents are permitted for industrial pur- poses and are exempted from customs duties, charges, and other taxes. Licenses to import gold are issued by the Minis- try of Trade, Industry, and Commerce; no license is required to export gold. Official institutions in Barbados do not pur- chase gold. Changes during 1973 January 1. The Minister of Finance delegated by order the performance of his ordinary functions as the Exchange Con- trol Authority to the Central Bank of Barbados. January 16. The buying and selling rates for the Jamaica dollar quoted by the East Caribbean Currency Authority henceforth were based on the prevailing sterling /U.S. dollar rate; previously, fixed rates were quoted. February 13. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the fixed relationship between the East Caribbean dollar and sterling was maintained at ECS4.80 = £ stg. 1 and the East Caribbean dollar continued to float with sterling. June 1. Import duties on many commodities were in- creased. August 1. Barbados became one of the four initial members of the Caribbean Community and Common Market. August 1. The common external tariff of the Caribbean Common Market was brought into force. September 4. The Miscellaneous Controls (General Open Import Licenses) Regulations, 1973 added buses, coffee, tea, cocoa, cement, and certain other items to the list of commodi- ties subject to individual import license irrespective of origin. Milk, wheat flour, and millfeed were added to the list of commodities requiring an individual license when imported from Guyana, Jamaica, or Trinidad and Tobago. November 22. The Miscellaneous Controls (Export Re- strictions) Regulations of November 1973 made the export of cane sugar, cement, and petroleum products subject to spe- cific license. December 3. The Barbados dollar replaced the East Carib- bean dollar as the Barbados currency unit. The par value remained unchanged at 0.444335 gram of fine gold per Barba- dos dollar, the fixed relationship for sterling was maintained at BDS 4.80 = £ stg. 1, and the Barbados dollar continued to float with sterling. 60 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BELGIUM-LUXEMBOURG Exchange Rate System The par values are 0.0177734 gram of fine gold per Belgian Franc and per Luxembourg Franc. Belgium and Luxem- bourg have established central rates of BF/Lux F 48.6572 = SDR 1, and avail themselves of wider margins. There are two spot exchange markets —the official (reglementeor regulated) and the free; these markets are separated and foreign currency acquired in one may not be sold in the other. Most current transactions are settled in the official market and most capital transactions in the free market. In the official exchange market, only authorized banks may carry out exchange transactions permitted in that market. l Belgium-Luxembourg maintains a maximum margin of 2% per cent for exchange rates in the official market between the Belgian franc /Luxembourg franc and the Danish Krone, the dcutsche mark, the French franc, 2 the Norwegian krone, and the Swedish krona, while a maximum margin of 1V2 per cent on either side of the cross-parity of BF 100 = f. 6.8953 or f. 1 = BF 14.5026 is maintained for the Netherlands guilder. No announced margins are maintained for any other cur- rency. On December 31, 1973 the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar in the official market were BF 41.22 and BF 41.42, respectively, per US$1. Most exchange transac- tions are settled through the official market. For all inward and outward payments in excess of BF 10 million through that market, supporting documents must be submitted to the Beige-Luxembourg Exchange Institute (Institut Belgo-Lux- embourgeois du Change or IBLC). In the free exchange market, all currencies (including do- mestic and foreign banknotes) may be bought and sold at freely fluctuating rates. On December 31, 1973 the free mar- ket rates between banks for the U.S. dollar were BF 41.17 buying, and BF 41.30 selling, per US$1. Depending on the category of payments and receipts, either one exchange market or the other must be used; in a few cases, however, there is freedom of choice as to the exchange market in which conversion is to be effected. In the official market, authorized banks in Belgium-Lux- embourg may deal with other authorized banks and with nonresidents in any of the convertible currencies; however, there are special regulations for the zaire. Nonbank residents may not acquire or surrender convertible currencies in the official spot market until a foreign payment is due. Nonbank residents may make forward purchases and sales of convert- ible currencies in the official market through authorized banks, provided that the currencies thus acquired are used for 1 The currencies dealt with in the official market are Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs (commercial), Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, South African rand, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. They are referred to in this survey as the convertible currencies. Although Ziirian currency (the zaire) is officially quoted, the Belgian-Luxembourg Economic Union does not permit the use of the zaire in settlements with countries other than Zaire, or the exchange of the zaire for convertible Belgian bines or other convertible currencies. The Australian dollar and the South African rand, although traded in the official market, are not officially quoted. The Japanese yen, also traded in the official market, was officially quoted with effect from January 2, 1974. * Intervention to maintain the margin for the French franc was suspended oo January 21, 1974. the authorized settlement of obligations within five working days from delivery; exchange not used within that period must be resold in the official market. Profits resulting from forward contracts not covering authorized inward or outward payments through the official market must be given up to the Treasury. Any resident or nonresident, banks included, may deal in any currency in the free market. Exchange rates in the forward market are normally left to the interplay of market forces. Belgium and Luxembourg formally accepted the obliga- tions of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agree- ment, as from February 15, 1961. Exchange Control Territory There is no exchange control between Belgium and Luxem- bourg (the Belgian-Luxembourg Economic Union—BLEU); the two countries constitute a single exchange control terri- tory in relation to other countries. Administration of Control The ultimate responsibility for the administration of ex- change control in the Belgian-Luxembourg Economic Union is exercised by the Belgo-Luxembourg Exchange Institute. Exchange control powers for most payments and transfers are delegated to authorized banks. The BLEU Convention of May 23, 1935, revised with effect from August 1, 1965 by a Protocol of January 29, 1963, conferred on the Belgo-Luxem- bourg Administrative Commission the authority to license trade transactions; this Commission determines import and export policy, but has delegated the issuance of import and export licenses to the licensing offices of the BLEU, one of which is located in each country. Prescription of Currency The prescription of currency requirements operate mainly to ensure that settlements with foreign countries are made, according to their nature, through the appropriate exchange market or, where payments in Belgian or Luxembourg francs are involved, through the appropriate category of nonresident account. Foreign countries are divided into two groups: the bilateral countries 3 and the convertible area (all other countries). All inward and outward transactions are classified in four groups, which may be summarized as follows: List A covers merchandise, transport expenses, industrial expenses (e.g., costs of processing), and other commercial expenses, includ- ing insurance; List B covers settlements of travel firms, sala- ries, pensions, fees, subscriptions, taxes, and public administration payments; List C covers (1) administration expenses, (2) income on securities, loans, etc., rents, and oper- ating profits, and (3) repatriation of certain foreign long-term investments and transfers by emigrants of foreign nationality; List D covers gifts, life insurance payments, family mainte- 3 The bilateral group countries are Burundi, Rwanda, and Zaire. The BLEU is not a party, however, to any bilateral payments agreements. 61 ©International Monetary Fund.

The permissible methods of settlement for foreign pay- ments are summarized in the accompanying table. In dealing with countries in the convertible area, transactions contained in Lists A and B must be settled through the official market (or, if made in Belgian and Luxembourg francs, through Con- vertible Accounts) and those contained in List D through the free market (or through Financial Accounts). As regards transactions in List C, outward payments for some of these (administration expenses and investment earnings) are chan- neled through the official market (or Convertible Ac- counts), 4 while outward payments for all others and all inward payments can be transferred through either the offi- cial or the free market (or through either Convertible or Financial Accounts). Transactions that may or must be set- tled through the free market may also be effected in domestic or foreign banknotes. In addition to the general methods of settlement described above, individual licenses are granted in order to allow trans- fers through the official market for some of the transactions mentioned in List D. These cover essentially direct invest- ment by enterprises and some capital transfers by individuals. Nonresident Accounts Belgian or Luxembourg franc accounts of nonresidents are classified as follows: 1. Convertible Accounts. Balances on these accounts are equivalent to currencies negotiated on the official market, and these accounts may be opened freely in the name of any nonresident. 6 They are not related to any country or mone- tary area. They may be used freely for settlements with resi- dents which either must or may be made through the official market and for retransfer abroad through the official market, and they may be credited freely with proceeds from the sale by a nonresident of convertible currencies in the official mar- ket to authorized banks in Belgium-Luxembourg. Balances on Convertible Accounts may be transferred freely to other Convertible Accounts or be converted into any currency in the official market. Advances on Convertible Accounts other than mail-credit advances are subject to authorization by the IBLC. Convertible Accounts may be held only in the form of sight accounts (demand deposits) and balances may not bear interest except for amounts originating from documentary credits established by banks resident in specified countries. Furthermore, banks levy a negative interest charge ("commis- sion") on accruals to such balances over the level in a refer- S U M M A RY OF PERM ISS IBLE METHODS OF SETTLEMENT FOR FORE IGN PAYMENTS TRANSACT ION LIST C O U N T RY GROUP FOR E IGN C U R R E N CY EX CHANGE MARKET Outward Payments A , B , C ( 1 ) , C ( 2) Convertible Convertible Off ic ial C(3) D A , B , C, D A, B C D A ,B C D Conver t ib le Any Official or free Convertible Bilateral A ny - Free - Inward Payments Convertible Convertible Convertible Conver t ib le Convertible Other Any Off ic ial Official or free Free Free Bilateral Convertible Official Bilateral Bilateral Convertible Other A ny Official or free Free Free NONR E S ID ENT ACCOUNT IN FRANCS Convertible Convertible or Financial Financial Bilateral5 Convertible ence period.7 Reserve requirements are applicable to the level of balances in Convertible Accounts and to any increases or decreases therein, in either case calculated on a specified refer- ence period. 8 2.

They may be used freely for settlements which either must or may be made through the free market and for retransfer abroad through the free market, and they may be credited freely with proceeds from the sale by a nonresident of gold or any currency in the free market. Domestic banknotes and proceeds from the sale in the free market of foreign banknotes, when deposited with authorized banks by foreign travelers in Belgium-Luxem- bourg or by persons residing abroad, may be credited freely to Financial Accounts. Transfers between Financial Ac- counts are free. Balances on these accounts may be used to purchase gold or any currency negotiated on the free market. 3. Bilateral Accounts. These accounts may be opened for residents of bilateral countries (see footnote 3), and they are related to the country of residence of the account holder. They are used for settlements with bilateral countries, and may be credited with proceeds from the sale by a nonresident of convertible currencies in the official market. Balances on Bilateral Accounts may be transferred to other Bilateral Ac- counts related to the same country. Transfers may also be made freely between Bilateral Accounts related to Burundi, Rwanda, and Zaire. In practice, the authorities permit the conversion of balances on Bilateral Accounts of the central banks of these three countries into foreign currencies in the official market. Imports and Import Payments All imports of Rhodesian origin are prohibited. Individual licenses are required for (1) all imports from Albania, Bul- garia, the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, East- era Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan, North Korea, Outer Mongolia, Poland, Romania, the U.S.S.R., and North Viet-Nam ,10 and (2) a number of imports from all other countries except Luxembourg. ll The commodities for which individual licenses are required include many textile products, certain agricultural products and foodstuffs, and coal and kerosene. All other commodities, which constitute about 85 per cent of total imports, are free of license and quantitative 7 The charge was suspended with effect from January 1, 1974. The prohibition on interest payments was revoked with effect from January 28, 1974. From the same date, banks were again permitted to accept time or notice deposits on Convertible Accounts, for terms not exceeding one year. "Both reserve requirements were eliminated with effect from February 1, 1974. 9 Foreign diplomats, foreign nationals employed by diplomatic representa- tions accredited in the BLEU and by specified international organizations situated in the BLEU, individuals residing in Burundi, Rwanda, or Zaire, and BLEU nationals residing abroad temporarily for professional reasons are authorized to maintain Assimilated Resident Accounts. 10 Import licenses are issued freely for a large number of commodities when originating in and shipped from Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and U.S.S.R. 11 Most imports in the last group do not require an import license when imported from the Netherlands or from other EEC countries.

Many commodities subject to individual licensing are also admitted without quantitative restriction. Imports from non-EEC countries of most products cov- ered by the Common Agricultural Policy of the EEC are subject to variable import levies which have replaced all pre- vious barriers to imports; common EEC regulations are also applied to imports from non-EEC countries of most other agricultural and livestock products. No exchange control documentation is required for im- ports not exceeding BF 10,000 in value. The authorized bank is required to make certain that payment is made by one of the methods laid down in the regulations (see section on Prescription of Currency, above) and that foreign exchange is not acquired until the import payment is due. If these require- ments are not fulfilled, the authorized bank submits a request to the central exchange control authority for special permis- sion. Prior examination of supporting documents by the IBLC is required for payments exceeding BF 10 million, and exchange control approval is required for payments for im- ports more than three months before or after the date of customs clearance. Payments for transit transactions must be made within three months from the date of any advance payment collected from the foreign buyer. Payments for Invisibles Payments to convertible area countries for transactions included in Lists A, B, and subcategories (1) and (2) of List C must be made through the official exchange market or by crediting Belgian or Luxembourg francs to a Convertible Account.12 Supporting documents must be presented to an authorized bank; for payments exceeding BF 10 million and in other exceptional cases, prior examination of the support- ing documents by the IBLC is required. Payments to convert- ible area countries for items in subcategory (3) of List C may be made through either the official market (alternatively, by crediting Belgian or Luxembourg francs to a Convertible Account) or through the free market (alternatively, by credit- ing Belgian or Luxembourg francs to a Financial Account, or in foreign or domestic banknotes); payments for items in List D must be made through the free market (alternatively, by crediting Belgian or Luxembourg francs to a Financial Ac- count, or in foreign or domestic banknotes). Payments to bilateral countries (see footnote 3) must be made by crediting Belgian or Luxembourg francs to a Bilateral Account related to the country concerned; payments to Zaire, however, may also be made in zaires through a convertible account in Zaire. Foreign and domestic banknotes may be exported freely. Exports and Export Proceeds The export of all goods to Rhodesia is prohibited in accor- dance with UN Security Council Resolution No. 253(68) of 12 But see footnote 4. 63 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BELGIUM-LUXEMBOURG May 29, 1968. Individual licenses are required for specified exports to all countries except Luxembourg. 13 All other ex- ports are free of license; only a simple form completed by the exporter giving notification of the export is required. No exchange control documentation is required for exports not exceeding BF 10,000 in value. The authorized bank is required to make sure that export proceeds are received in accordance with the regulations (see section on Prescription of Currency, above). Special authorization is required to col- lect export proceeds more than six months after the date of exportation. Export proceeds in convertible currencies must, within eight days of receipt, be surrendered to an authorized bank, or, alternatively, they may be deposited in a Controlled Resident Account in Foreign Currency with an authorized bank if they are to be used later for current payments autho- rized to be made in these currencies. Advance collection of export proceeds exceeding BF 5 million in value requires prior authorization of the IBLC; in addition, payments for exports to bilateral countries may not be received more than three months before the date foreseen for exportation; proceeds from transit transactions must be collected within three months from the date of payment to the foreign supplier. Prior examination of supporting documents by the IBLC is required for receipts exceeding BF 10 million. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts in convertible currencies from invisibles con- nected with commercial transactions (Lists A and B—see section on Prescription of Currency, above) must, within eight days of receipt, be surrendered (i.e., sold in the official exchange market), or, alternatively, be credited to a Con- trolled Resident Account in Foreign Currency with an autho- rized bank if they are to be used later for current payments authorized to be made in these currencies. Prior examination of supporting documents by the IBLC is required for receipts exceeding BF 10 million through the official market. Receipts in convertible currencies from transactions included in List C may be retained or sold in the official or the free market. Receipts from other transactions (List D) and receipts in all other currencies may be retained or sold in the free market. Proceeds from transactions included in Lists C and D may also be collected in domestic or foreign banknotes. Foreign and domestic banknotes may be imported freely. Capital All capital transactions with convertible area countries may be carried out freely through the free market, by settle- ment in Belgian or Luxembourg francs through the Financial Account of a nonresident, or in domestic or foreign bank- notes. Direct investments by enterprises and some capital transfers by individuals, including gifts, family maintenance payments, remittances by emigrants of Belgian or Luxem- bourg nationality, and inheritances, but not transactions of a financial character, may also be made through the official market, subject to individual license. The exchange control 13 Most exports do not require an export license when exported to the Netherlands or to other EEC countries. 64 authorities may guarantee the repatriation of approved for- eign investments made in Belgium-Luxembourg. In that case, capital brought in through the official market (under special license, and as an exception to the standard prescription of currency set out above) may be repatriated through that mar- ket. Also eligible for outward transfer through the official mar- ket are the amortization and redemption proceeds of bonds denominated in Belgian or Luxembourg francs, quoted on a stock exchange in the BLEU, and owned by residents of convertible area countries, provided that such securities had been held at least six months prior to the maturity date. All transactions in securities by residents or nonresidents are free, but the financial settlement of such transactions must con- form to the general regulations. The prior approval of the Minister of Finance is required for issues of securities on the Belgian capital market by nonresidents. Public bids by for- eign companies or individuals for the purchase or exchange of shares issued by Belgian companies require the prior ap- proval of the Ministry of Finance. Outward payments for capital transactions with bilateral countries must be made only in Belgian or Luxembourg francs through Bilateral Ac- counts, or in the case of Zaire, in zalres; inward payments for capital transactions with bilateral countries may be made in Belgian or Luxembourg francs through Bilateral Accounts, in any currency through the free market, or in the case of Zaire, in zaires. The external position of authorized banks is subject to control. Banks in Belgium and Luxembourg have been re- quested not to allow their net external debtor spot positions (in foreign currency relating to the official market plus, vis- a-vis nonresidents, in Belgian francs and Luxembourg francs in Convertible Accounts) to increase beyond specified levels. Banks have also been instructed that their overall foreign currency position relating to the official market (spot and forward combined) should normally be close to balance and should not register a substantial creditor or debtor position. Furthermore, since May 11, 1971, banks have been prohib- ited from opening time or prior notice Convertible Accounts for nonresidents and (with minor exceptions) from paying interest on demand deposits in Convertible Accounts. 14 Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in the form of coins or bars, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in these forms by residents and nonresidents are unrestricted and free of license. Settlements in respect of gold transactions with convertible area countries (other than pay- ments for semiprocessed gold imported by professional users) may only be made through the free market, through Financial Accounts in Belgian or Luxembourg francs, or in domestic or foreign banknotes.

The interest prohibition for Convertible Accounts was lifted with effect from January 28, 1974. From the same date, banks were again permitted to accept time or notice deposits on Convertible Accounts, for terms not exceeding one year. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution levied on imports or exports of gold, except imports for indus- trial or handicraft purposes. Licenses are required for imports of semiprocessed gold; these are issued to professional users, who have to make payment through the official market. Transactions in monetary gold, i.e., coins and bars, are ex- empt from value-added tax in Belgium. Changes during 1973 January 1. The import regime applicable to EEC member countries became applicable to Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, except for goods covered by common mar- ket organizations of the EEC, for which this occurred on February 1. January 1. Luxembourg enacted two new laws. One re- quired mutual funds and investment companies in Luxem- bourg to register with the Bank Control Commissioner and made them subject to his surveillance in much the same way as banks. The other law established the legal basis for operat- ing trust companies; these also would be subject to surveil- lance by the Bank Control Commissioner. January 2. An agreement came into force between the Lux- embourg Bank Control Commissioner and the Luxembourg banks, under which banks established in Luxembourg be- came subject to a reserve requirement similar to that in effect in Belgium, against nonresidents' holdings of convertible Luxembourg and Belgian francs. Furthermore, banks in Lux- embourg were requested to confine their credits to Belgian enterprises within normal limits. February 13. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Belgium and Luxembourg main- tained their central rates in terms of gold and SDKs. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously BF /Lux F 44.8159 = US$1, became BF /Lux F 40.3344 = US$1, corresponding to BF /Lux F 48.6572 = SDR 1. The new intervention limits for the U.S. dollar were set at BF 39.4265 buying, and BF 41.2420 selling, per US$1. February 19. Revised regulations were issued concerning the opening and functioning of Special Foreign Accounts (in Belgian or Luxembourg francs) and Foreign Accounts in Foreign Currencies for international organizations, foreign diplomatic representations, foreign diplomats, and foreign nationals employed by diplomatic representations and inter- national organizations, accredited or located in the BLEU. The former accounts were allowed to bear interest. The regu- lations ruling Assimilated Resident Accounts also were re- vised. February 26. The provisions of the gentlemen's agreement of November 4, 1972 between the National Bank and the financial institutions in Belgium were modified with effect from March 1 and extended until May 31,1973. The marginal reserve requirement against the growth in their net liabilities on Convertible Accounts in Belgian francs over the level in the base period (August 31-November 1, 1972) was to in- crease gradually from 70 per cent to 100 per cent by April 20, 1973, while the average reserve requirement against such lia- bilities in the same base period was to increase from the equivalent of 17.5 per cent to 25 per cent by April 20, 1973. In addition, a marginal reserve requirement of 100 per cent BELGIUM-LUXEMBOURG was also gradually applied, with effect from March 12, against any increase in the net spot foreign currency debtor position in the official market over the level in a base period (February 1-10,1973). The Luxembourg Bank Control Com- missioner subsequently applied similar controls over the net spot foreign currency debtor positions of Luxembourg banks in the official market (see March 21, below). March 1. The IBLC instructed banks in Belgium and Lux- embourg to purchase foreign currency from nonresidents in the official market only provided that the nonresident con- cerned was credited on a special "Transitory Convertible Ac- count," opened with the bank making the purchase. Such accounts could be debited only for payments in favor of residents, subject to the existing rules for permitted payments to the debit of Convertible Accounts; they could not be recon- verted into foreign currencies. The IBLC also instructed authorized banks in Belgium and Luxembourg to take the necessary steps with regard to hold- ers of Convertible Accounts to avoid any unjustified accumu- lation of holdings in these accounts and, where appropriate, to require from the holders either immediate utilization of any excess balances or permission to reconvert them into foreign currency. Alternatively, authorized banks were instructed to obtain satisfactory explanations for the holding of such bal- ances and to submit the documentation to the IBLC, which reserved the right either to freeze any amounts for which no satisfactory explanation could be provided or to deduct any resulting exchange profit. March 16. 'Transitory Convertible Accounts" were abol- ished, and balances therein could be transferred to Convert- ible Accounts in Francs. The instructions of March 9, 1972 and August 24,1972 regarding banks' external positions were maintained, as was the instruction of March 1, 1973 that credits to Convertible Accounts should only be made for purposes of official market payments in favor of residents. March 19. Belgium and Luxembourg henceforth main- tained a maximum margin of 2% per cent for exchange rates in transactions in the official market between their own cur- rencies and the Danish krone, the deutsche mark, the French franc, the Norwegian krone, and the Swedish krona; margins of up to 1Y2 per cent either side of the cross-parity continued to be observed for the Netherlands guilder. No announced margins would be maintained for other currencies. March 21. The agreement between the Luxembourg Bank Control Commissioner and the Luxembourg banks on re- serve requirements against net Convertible Account liabilities was extended to cover the banks' net spot foreign currency debtor position in the official market. March 26. At the request of the Belgian monetary authori- ties, banks established in Belgium agreed, with effect from April 1, to charge a negative interest rate in the form of a special commission of 0.25 per cent per week, calculated on a daily basis and charged monthly, on all holdings of Belgian francs in Convertible Accounts in excess of the daily average of holdings in the account concerned during the last quarter of 1972. As a result of an agreement concluded between the Luxembourg Bank Control Commissioner and resident banks, the charge was also applied by Luxembourg banks on Convertible Accounts in Belgian and Luxembourg francs. 65 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BELGIUM-LUXEMBOURG April. It was announced that the three Benelux countries would restrict imports of Japanese products in the field of "entertainment" electronics. The restrictions were lifted after the signing of an agreement between Benelux and Japan on December 18. May 28. The gentlemen's agreement between the National Bank and the financial institutions in Belgium was extended until September 30, 1973. On May 31, the agreement between the Luxembourg Bank Control Commission and Luxem- bourg banks also was extended until September 30. July 24. Residents could no longer resort freely to credit from authorized banks in foreign currencies on the official market for the execution of payments in favor of nonresi- dents. Such advances from banks in Belgium and Luxem- bourg became subject to individual authorization by the IBLC. As an exception, banks did not need specific authori- zation to grant advances to transit traders for the period between the payment to the foreign seller and the payment from the foreign buyer. (The freedom suspended on July 24 was restored on January 28, 1974.) September 3. In agreement with the monetary authorities, Belgian banks suspended, with retroactive effect from Au- gust 1, 1973, the negative interest charge on excess nonresi- dent holdings of Belgian francs in Convertible Accounts. The charge was not suspended in Luxembourg. September 18. The IBLC issued new instructions to com- mercial banks in Belgium and Luxembourg tightening the controls over the external position of authorized banks by the introduction of a uniform ceiling on their net external liabili- ties related to the official exchange market. A limit was estab- lished on the net debtor position of each bank, calculated daily as the sum of the net spot debtor position in foreign currency relating to the official market and the net spot liabil- ities in Belgian francs or Luxembourg francs in Convertible Accounts; for most banks this limit was set at BF 20 million, but for the major banks it was fixed at higher amounts in keeping with their size and turnover. As under the previous ceilings, temporary excesses of up to 10 per cent would be tolerated so as not to disturb the normal operation of current transactions. The existing IBLC instruction to Belgian and Luxembourg banks not to incur any substantial overall posi- tion in foreign currencies (creditor or debtor position, spot plus forward) was maintained. The instructions of March 9, April 5, and August 24, 1972 were revoked. (The instruction of September 18 remained in force when on January 25, 1974 the IBLC imposed a ceiling on the net foreign asset position of banks.) September 19. Belgian banks reimposed the negative inter- est charge on nonresident holdings of Belgian francs in Con- vertible Accounts. The negative rate of interest was again set at 0.25 per cent a week, but it was charged on balances exceeding the daily average of the holder's balance during July and August 1973. As before, it was calculated on a daily basis. Luxembourg banks maintained this charge at the re- quest of the Bank Control Commissioner. (On January 1, 1974 they reduced it to zero.) September 28. The gentlemen's agreement between the National Bank and the financial institutions was extended un- til January 31, 1974, with certain modifications which were expected to increase from about BF 24 billion to some BF 30-35 billion the amount of liquidity frozen in the form of noninterest-bearing deposits with the National Bank. The reserve requirements against resident-held sight and time lia- bilities were raised in four stages and reserve requirements were for the first time applied also to increases in bank credit granted over the levels in specified reference periods. With respect to nonresidents' holdings of Belgian francs, however, there was no change, the reserve requirement remaining at 25 per cent of net liabilities in Convertible Accounts during the reference period, plus or minus 100 per cent of any increase or decrease since the reference period. The reserve require- ment applicable to the banks' debtor position in foreign cur- rencies on the official market also remained unchanged, any increase above the reference period being frozen at the rate of 100 per cent. (The agreement was extended, with eased provisions, from February 1, 1974 until March 31, 1974. Among the principal changes was the elimination, with effect from February 1, of the reserve requirements relating to Convertible Accounts, both with respect to their level and any increases or decreases therein.) The existing agreement in Luxembourg with respect to Convertible Accounts and foreign currency liability positions was extended on October 19. (With effect from February 21, 1974 the Luxembourg Bank Control Commissioner reduced to zero the rate of reserve requirements on Convertible Ac- counts.) October 24. Exports of petroleum products from Belgium to all countries except Luxembourg were made subject to licensing. November 28. The IBLC further reduced, as it had previ- ously done on September 18, the limit imposed on the net debtor positions of Belgian and Luxembourg banks on Con- vertible Accounts and in foreign currency on the official mar- ket. (This limit was subsequently increased on February 6, 1974.) December 24. The Australian dollar and the South African rand were admitted to the official exchange market. They were not officially quoted. December 26. In agreement with the monetary authorities, the Belgian banks decided to suspend, with effect from Janu- ary 1, 1974, the negative interest charge on holdings in Con- vertible Accounts exceeding the reference ceiling. December 27. The National Bank of Belgium announced that the yen would be officially quoted with effect from Janu- ary 2, 1974. 66 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BOLIVIA Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.0409256 gram of fine gold per Bolivian Peso, corresponding to $b 21.7143 = SDR 1. A central rate has been established of $b 20 = US$1, corresponding to $b 24.127 = SDR 1. The U.S. dollar is the intervention currency and Bolivia avails itself of wider margins. For operational purposes, the exchange market is divided into two sectors: the public sector and the private sector. The Central Bank of Bolivia operates in the public sector, buying foreign exchange from the Government, the official enter- prises, including the Bolivian Mining Corporation (COMI- BOL), and private export firms, and selling foreign exchange to the Banco del Estado, the commercial banks and exchange houses, and the Government and its official agencies. The commercial banks and exchange houses purchase exchange accruing to the private sector on account of capital and invisi- bles, and they cover all foreign exchange requirements of the private sector. The exchange rate of the Central Bank on December 31,1973 was $b 20.00 buying, and $b 20.02 selling, per US$1. All sales of foreign exchange are subject to a 1.6 per cent exchange tax, a 2 per mill stamp tax, and a 2 per mill banking commission. Accordingly, the effective selling rate of the commercial banks and exchange houses on the same date was $b 20.40 per US$1. Bolivia formally accepted the obligations of Article V I I I, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from June 5, 1967. Prescription of Currency Certain settlements with Hungary and Poland are chan- neled through special accounts. l Otherwise, there are no prescription of currency requirements. Settlements are usu- ally made in U.S. dollars or other convertible currencies. Payments between Bolivia and Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Co- lombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay, may be made through accounts maintained with each other by the central banks. Imports and Import Payments All imports by public sector agencies require the prior authorization of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce; they are not permitted to import commodities also available in Bolivia. Private imports of certain commodities also re- quire such prior authorization; these goods include live cattle, various foodstuffs, raw cotton, and petroleum and petroleum products. The import of cigarettes, cement, and certain other locally produced goods is prohibited. All other goods may be imported freely. Exchange to pay for imports may be pur- chased freely from commercial banks. Most foreign credits, including officially guaranteed suppliers' credits, are subject to authorization by the National Economic and Planning Council. 1 Bilateral payments arrangements agreed with Bulgaria did not come into operation during 1973. Most private sector imports are subject to a customs sur- charge of 1 per cent ad valorem. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles may be made freely. Residents of Bolivian or foreign nationality must pay a travel tax when leaving the country. The tax is $b 150 for air travel to neigh- boring countries, $b 60 for overland travel to such countries, $b 300 for air travel to other Latin American countries, and $b 400 for air travel to countries outside Latin America. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports are not normally subject to licensing, although certain exports may be prohibited or restricted from time to time owing to domestic supply factors. All proceeds from exports of the public and private sectors must be sold to the Central Bank within 15 days of receipt, with the exception of reasonable amounts deducted for foreign exchange expendi- tures undertaken to effect the export. The marketing of min- erals is a state monopoly; in practice, COMIBOL and the medium-sized mines export their own production and COMI- BOL and the Mining Bank most of that of the small mines of the private sector. The small mines may export the rest of their production themselves or through traders. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange derived from invisibles may be retained or sold in the exchange market. Capital Outward capital transfers by residents or nonresidents are free of control and may be made freely; inward capital trans- fers also may be made freely, but government receipts of transfers and grants and all proceeds of borrowings from foreign public sector agencies must be surrendered to the Central Bank. All foreign credits, including suppliers' credits, to government agencies and autonomous entities, and credits to the private sector with official guarantees, are subject to prior authorization by the National Economic and Planning Council. Foreign investments in Bolivia, except those involving pe- troleum and mining, are governed by the provisions of the Investment Law of December 16, 1971. The law is adminis- tered by the National Investment Institute. Investments in petroleum and mining are governed by the General Hydro- carbons Law and the Mining Code. Gold By virtue of Supreme Decree No. 07771 of August 2, 1966, imports and exports of gold and domestic trading in gold are subject to regulation by the Central Bank. The Decree also designated the Central Bank to purchase, for its use or for export in the form of gold bars, the total national production of gold. Supreme Decree No. 8635 of January 29, 1969 fur- 67 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BOLIVIA ther regulated the purchase and sale of gold, silver, and plati- num by the Central Bank and the Mining Bank. The Central Bank purchases a limited amount of gold at US$42.22 an ounce from the foreign-owned company and the Mining Bank, which buys from the smaller producers on behalf of the Central Bank. The Central Bank also purchases gold at the free market price, but only as a marketing agency for the mining sector, and not for its own account. COMIBOL exports all the gold it produces at the free market price. The fo- reign-owned company and the Mining Bank are also allowed to export gold at the free market price. The Mining Bank is authorized to sell a specified quantity of gold annually to domestic jewelers and dentists and is obliged to sell the re- mainder to the Central Bank. Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form other than bars in Bolivia. Changes during 1973 February 13. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, a central rate of $b 20 = US$1 was established. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar remained unchanged. Bolivia continued to avail itself of wider margins. February 21. Restrictions were placed on the export of natural rubber. July 31. A reciprocal credit agreement was signed with Paraguay. August 16. Exports of meat, poultry, sugar, rice, corn, and vegetables were suspended. October 3. A reciprocal credit agreement was signed with Uruguay. November 30. The importation of certain agricultural trac- tors was prohibited. December 1. A new customs tariff came into effect. 68 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BOTSWANA Exchange and Trade System Botswana's currency is the South African Rand. The par value of the rand is 1.04550 grams of fine gold per rand, which corresponds to R 1 = SDR 1.17648. However, no exchange transactions take place at the par value. The South African Reserve Bank quotes a middle exchange rate for the U.S. dollar of US$1.4900 per R 1. Exchange rates are based on the South African Reserve Bank's rates for the U.S. dollar against rand (US$1.4937 buying and US$1.4862 selling per R 1) and the London market rates for the currencies con- cerned against the U.S. dollar. Botswana has ceased to be a Scheduled Territory in terms of the U.K. Exchange Control Act, 1947 but under current U.K. exchange control regulations continues to be regarded as a country of the Overseas Sterling Area. Botswana also forms part of the Rand Monetary Area, which is a single exchange control territory comprising Botswana, Lesotho, South Africa, and Swaziland. For purposes of exchange con- trol over transactions in securities or gold, residents of a member country of the latter area are not regarded as resi- dents of another member country. The Ministry of Finance and Development Planning controls all external currency transactions. No restrictions are applied to payments within the Rand Monetary Area, and in principle these are uncontrolled and unrecorded. In relation to countries outside the Rand Mone- tary Area, Botswana applies exchange controls that are gen- erally similar to those of South Africa, although Botswa- na's treatment of certain capital transfers may be more lib- eral. Payments to nonresidents for current transactions, while subject to control, are not restricted, but applications for outward transfers of capital are considered on their merits. The rulings on applications for inward and outward capital transfers may depend on whether the applicant is a temporar- ily resident foreign national, a nonresident, or a resident. Authority to approve some types of current payments is dele- gated to commercial banks up to established limits; this is true, for example, of the basic exchange allowance for tourist travel (the equivalent of R 2,000 in a calendar year for an adult and R 800 for a child) and a smaller annual allocation for travel to neighboring countries. There are no bilateral payments arrangements. Botswana is a member of a customs union with Lesotho, South Africa, and Swaziland, and there are no import restric- tions on goods originating in any country of the customs union. Imports from South Africa do not require licenses and include an unknown quantity of goods originating outside the customs union. Insofar as Botswana imports goods direct from countries outside the customs union, such imports are usually licensed in conformity with South Africa's import regulations. Import licenses are valid for all countries and entitle the holder to buy the foreign exchange required to make the import payment. Certain exports are subject to licensing, mainly for revenue and similar reasons. Further- more, goods of domestic origin may move freely between Botswana and Rhodesia by virtue of a customs agreement of 1956, provided that they are not intended for re-export; im- ports of Rhodesian beer, tobacco, and cigarettes are not per- mitted, however. Changes during 1973 February 14. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the par value of the South African rand was maintained in terms of gold. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously R 0.782891 = US$1, became R 0.704603 = US$1. The South African Re- serve Bank announced a middle rate for the U.S. dollar of R 1 = US$1.4193, and its fixed rates for the U.S. dollar were changed to US$1.4229 buying and US$1.4157 selling, per R 1. June 5. The South African Reserve Bank henceforth quoted a middle exchange rate for the U.S. dollar of US$1.4900 per R 1. New official buying and selling rates were set at US$1.4937 and US$1.4862, respectively, per R 1. 69 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BRAZIL Exchange System On July 14,1948, a par value for the Brazilian Cruzeiro was established by Brazil with the Fund. However, exchange transactions no longer take place at rates based on that par value. Brazil follows a flexible exchange rate policy. Exchange transactions are carried out by the Central Bank, the Bank of Brazil, the authorized banks, and the exchange houses. The Central Bank operates in foreign exchange in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, and the Bank of Brazil undertakes exchange transactions in the name of the Central Bank in other parts of the country. The exchange houses deal only in banknotes and travelers checks in a "manual market." Uni- formity between the rates quoted by the monetary authorities and the effective rates of the authorized banks is ensured by the practice of the monetary authorities of standing ready to purchase exchange from the banks and to sell it to the banks on an adequate basis, for approved transactions; such pur- chases and sales are made at the official rate. On December 31, 1973, the buying and selling rates quoted by the monetary authorities to the public were Cr$6.180 and Cr$6.220 per US$1, respectively; those quoted by the authorized banks for transactions other than in banknotes or travelers checks were the same (see Table of Exchange Rates, below). The same exchange rates are applicable to "agreement dollars" used for settlements with bilateral agreement countries. Rates for other currencies are based on the U.S. dollar rates in Brazil and the rates for the currencies concerned in New York and Europe. With specified exceptions, foreign exchange transac- tions are subject to brokerage fees, calculated on a sliding scale, which for the rates listed above result in effective rates within 1 per cent on either side of the rates of the monetary authorities. On the buying side, other effective rates result from the following arrangements: (1) special regulations apply to cof- fee exports (see section on Exports and Export Proceeds, below); (2) a 10 per cent contribution ("contribution quota" or quota de contribui$do) is levied on proceeds from exports of cocoa beans and products; (3) a contribution quota of US$500 per ton f.o.b. is applied to proceeds from exports of chilled, fresh, and frozen beef; 1 and (4) a contribution quota of US$250 per ton f.o.b. is applied to proceeds from exports of processed beef. 2 On the selling side, a different effective rate arises from the provision of the Foreign Investment Law (see section on Payments for Invisibles, below), which specifies that the sum of profits and dividends effectively remitted to persons and companies resident abroad is subject to a supplementary in- come tax when the average of actual remittances in any three-year period is in excess of 12 per cent a year of registered capita! and reinvestment. The Bank of Brazil, acting on its own behalf or on behalf of the Central Bank, carries out a considerable proportion of 1 On February 19, 1974 the contribution quota on exports of fresh, chilled, or frozen boneless beef was reduced to US$250 a ton f.o.b. 2 On January 21, 1974 a contribution quota of 10 per cent was applied to proceeds from exports of raw hides of wild animals, and one of 5 per cent on export proceeds from tanned or processed hides of wild animals. 70 all exchange transactions. The following arrangements assure the Bank of Brazil of a large portion of the country's foreign exchange receipts: (1) Petrobras surrenders to the Bank its entire foreign exchange proceeds from certain exports of pe- troleum. (2) Proceeds from exports of iron ore by the Vale do Rio Doce Company also are surrendered to the Bank of Brazil. (3) All public sector agencies carry out their exchange operations through the Bank of Brazil. (4) Furthermore, ex- porters in regions not served by other banks sell their ex- change proceeds to the Bank. The Bank of Brazil sells foreign exchange for the require- ments of the Government at the exchange rate prevailing on the date the transaction is made. Like the other commercial banks the Bank of Brazil also sells foreign exchange for pay- ments in respect of a large number of imports, including crude oil and petroleum products, wheat, newsprint, fertiliz- ers, and the requirements of the Vale do Rio Doce Company. The Central Bank handles all exchange transactions in bilat- eral currencies and exchange transactions related to imports under U.S. aid (by transferring exchange to authorized banks or vice versa). The authorized banks are required to surrender to the Cen- tral Bank or to the Bank of Brazil (operating for the account of the Central Bank), at the close of each business day, any foreign exchange in excess of a net position of US$25,000 for each branch. The Central Bank and the Bank of Brazil, oper- ating for the account of the Central Bank, supply foreign exchange to authorized banks in amounts not exceeding those needed to eliminate an oversold position of up to US$500,000 and limited to 90 per cent of the exchange sold the previous day by the bank concerned to its customers; included in this limit is their "manual market" position (banknotes and travel- ers checks). The banks are permitted to sell foreign exchange to each other, provided that they are situated in the same trading center; transfers between branches of the same bank in different trading centers are also allowed* subject to certain conditions. In addition, since March 1971, exchange transac- tions have been permitted between banks in Rio de Janeiro and banks in Sao Paulo; such transactions may be carried out either by cable on a spot basis or on a forward basis and must be executed within 2 working days for spot transactions or not later than after 180 days for forward transactions. Since April 1972 authorized banks have also been permitted to engage in arbitrage among themselves when operating in the same trading center or between establishments in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. The "manual market" is conducted mainly by exchange houses, which are not permitted to main- tain a sold position and are not entitled to obtain exchange cover from the monetary authorities. Administration of Control The National Monetary Council, chaired by the Minister of Finance, is responsible for the formulation of overall for- eign exchange policy. In accordance with the guidelines estab- lished by the Council, and under the supervision of the Director in charge of Foreign Exchange Operations of the ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Central Bank, exchange control is operated by the Central Bank's Exchange Operations Department (GECAM) and Department for the Control and Registration of Foreign Cap- ital (FIRCE); the latter processes the registration of foreign capital for the purpose of its repatriation and of the remit- tance of income therefrom; it also exercises approval author- ity over the terms of foreign financing of imports for periods in excess of 360 days. Certain borrowing abroad requires the prior approval of the interministerial Foreign Loans Com- mission (CEMPEX). The National Council of Foreign Trade (CONCEX), chaired by the Minister of Industry and Commerce and estab- lished within his Ministry, formulates foreign trade policy. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is the Council's executive organ for dealing with foreign countries, while the Foreign Trade Department of the Bank of Brazil (CACEX) imple- ments the Council's decisions within Brazil. The Foreign Trade Department issues export and import certificates (guias de exporta?ao and guias de importacdo), and verifies price quotations, weights, measures, classifications, and types in import operations. CACEX also is in charge of approving import financing with terms of up to 360 days. Coffee exports are regulated by the Brazilian Coffee Insti- tute (IBC), which is an autonomous body responsible to the Minister of Industry and Commerce and operates within the general guidelines of the National Monetary Council. The Customs Policy Council (CPA), established within the Ministry of Finance, is responsible for formulating guidelines for tariff policy, subject to the legal powers of the National Monetary Council and the National Council of Foreign Trade. The CPA also decides on changes in customs duties under the provisions of existing legislation. Prescription of Currency Prescription of currency is in principle related to the coun- try of origin of imports or the country of final destination of exports, unless otherwise specifically prescribed or autho- rized. Settlements with payments agreement countries are made in clearing dollars through the relevant agreement ac- count. These accounts are maintained with Bulgaria, Eastern Germany, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia. Settlements with other countries with which Bra- zil has no payments agreements or arrangements are made in U.S. dollars or other convertible currencies. Reciprocal credit agreements providing for settlements through accounts de- nominated in U.S. dollars are in force with Argentina, Bo- livia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Peru. Proceeds from exports to Latin American member countries of the Inter-American Development Bank, other than Argentina, Mexico, and Venezuela, may be received in the currency of the importing country. Imports and Import Payments Special arrangements described below apply to imports of petroleum and petroleum products. The import of recre- ational boats of a value over US$3,500 and of commodities originating in or shipped from Cuba and Rhodesia is prohib- ited. All other imports may be grouped into the following two BRAZIL broad categories: (1) imports that are free of any requirement to secure prior administrative documentation, e.g., samples without commercial value, certain educational material, parts and accessories (valued up to the equivalent of US$5,000) for machinery, instruments, ships, and aircraft; and (2) imports that require an import certificate. The bulk of imports falls into the second category. The import certificate is issued subject to the presentation of data on the foreign price of the commodity and other relevant information CACEX may re- quire. Import certificates are issued on an f.o.b. basis; as a rule, they are issued freely and without undue delay and are valid for 180 days. For a number of specified imports in the second category, the import certificate may be obtained after the disembarkation of the commodity in Brazil, e.g., live plants, fish, various minerals, and paper. For certain other imports in the second category the prior approval of CACEX is required; these include goods imported by public bodies, imports for which tariff concessions are being sought, goods to be brought in with foreign financing with terms between 180 and 360 days, certain imports without exchange cover, goods for use in fairs and trade exhibitions, and used instru- ments, machinery, and equipment. Most commodities subject to an import certificate are exempt from this requirement when the value of the import transaction does not exceed US$2,000. As a general rule, imports may be cleared through customs before an exchange contract is closed. However, the maxi- mum period for which payments for imports may be delayed is 180 days from the date of shipment; this period may be extended to 360 days at the discretion of CACEX for imports of raw materials, spare parts for direct use by the importer, and capital goods which are not produced domestically. Fi- nancing arrangements for imports in which credit terms ex- ceed 360 days in amounts over US$500,000 require the prior approval of the Central Bank. Any bona fide interest involved in the above credit arrangements is approved freely. Spot contracts may be closed if the contract is intended to settle drafts, at sight or on maturity, and the appropriate shipping documents are presented. Spot exchange contracts must be settled within 2 working days. Forward contracts, for up to 180 days, may be closed when a letter of credit is being opened, or to pay for goods already shipped. Letters of credit must be opened within 5 working days from the date of the exchange contract. Commercial banks ordinarily require a guarantee deposit for their own protection for forward ex- change contracts; the amount of the deposit varies with the credit standing of the customer. When the contracts are liqui- dated, guarantee deposits may be used for payment of the foreign exchange concerned. In certain cases, interest at about 0.5 per cent a month is charged on the portion of the forward contract not covered by a deposit. Advance payments in amounts up to US$300 for imports of books may be made without prior authorization. Special procedures are applicable to certain imports of pe- troleum and petroleum products and of wheat. For petroleum and specified petroleum by-products, Petrobras concludes a "global foreign exchange contract" with the Bank of Brazil once every four months for its estimated requirements. The contract is concluded at the official market rate prevailing 10 71 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BRAZIL days prior to the closing of the contract. At the same time, the Bank of Brazil concludes a foreign exchange contract with the Central Bank, to cover its position, for an amount equiva- lent to the value of the "global contract" at the exchange rate at which the Central Bank sells foreign exchange to commer- cial banks; the rate applicable is again the one prevailing 10 days prior to the conclusion of the "global contract." Individ- ual exchange contracts for petroleum shipments made during the life of the "global contract" are then closed at the ex- change rate on which the latter is based. Payment by Petro- bras against such contracts is made in the following manner: 30 per cent of the value of an individual contract is deposited 15 days from the date of shipment, and the remaining 70 per cent 110 days after shipment. The liquidation of each individ- ual contract 110 days after shipment is accompanied by the liquidation, up to an equivalent value, of the exchange con- tract signed by the Bank of Brazil with the Central Bank; the liquidation of this latter exchange contract also takes place at the exchange rate at which the contract was originally signed. For some commodities, the application of import duties may be affected by the existence of similares nacionaisor the estab- lishment of a minimum import price (pauta de valor minima) or of a reference price. Certain imports are subject to customs surcharges. Payments for Invisibles Payments for current invisibles related to income from foreign capital, royalties, and technical assistance are gov- erned by the provisions of the Foreign Investment Law. In addition to certain restrictions on remittances stipulated in that law, limits are placed, by virtue of an internal Central Bank measure of September 19, 1965, on remittances of all royalties and technical assistance fees (see below). Authorized banks may sell foreign exchange up to the equivalent of US$300 a month for personal remittances abroad. The sale of foreign exchange for travel abroad is subject to special regula- tions as described below. Payments for other current invisi- bles require the approval of GECAM, which authorizes remittances freely, subject to the presentation of supporting documents as evidence that a bona fide current transaction is involved. Sales of foreign exchange to meet personal expenses con- nected with travel abroad are permitted up to US$1,000 a person a trip, without the prior approval of the Central Bank, on the following terms: (1) in banknotes up to US$100, and (2) in payment orders or travelers checks for the remainder. Applications for purchases of travel exchange in excess of US$1,000 must be submitted to the Central Bank, which considers each case on its merits; amounts in excess of US$1,000, when authorized, may be taken up in the form of payment orders only. Foreign residents in transit in Brazil are permitted to purchase foreign currency up to the equivalent of the amount they sold during the period of their stay in Brazil; however, purchases in excess of 30 per cent of the amount previously sold require the approval of the Central Bank. Each purchase transaction is registered and the records of these operations, which must contain the names of clients, are submitted daily to the Central Bank. 72 Remittances abroad of foreign capital, income from foreign investments and reinvestments, and remittances in respect of royalties and technical assistance are governed by Decree No. 55762 of February 17, 1965, which contains the regulations implementing the Foreign Investment Law (Law No. 4131, as amended by Law No. 4390). Remittances are allowed only when the foreign capital concerned, including reinvestments, and the contracts for patents and trademarks, and for techni- cal, scientific, and administrative assistance, are registered at FIRCE in accordance with the established rules (see section on Capital, below). The registration of contracts or deeds for technical assistance or the use of patents or trademarks is subject to the furnishing of proof that the document has been approved by the National Institute of Industrial Property. Remittances are normally authorized in the currency of regis- tration. Remittances of interest on loans and credits and of related amortization payments are permitted freely in accor- dance with the terms stipulated in the respective contract and recorded in the certificate of registration. A progressive supplementary income tax is levied on remit- tances to persons and companies resident abroad of earnings on foreign capital if their average over a three-year period exceeds 12 per cent of the registered capital and reinvest- ments. Dependent on prior proof of exports of manufactured goods, firms may obtain reduction or restitution of the in- come tax levied on remittances of royalties, technical assist- ance fees, and interest on loans registered with FIRCE (Decree-Law No. 491 of March 5, 1969). For foreign capital that produces goods or services for luxury consumption, re- mittances of profits are limited to 8 per cent per annum of the registered capital. Remittances of royalties by a branch or subsidiary established in Brazil to its head office abroad are not permitted when 50 per cent or more of the local firm's voting capital is directly or indirectly held by the foreign principal firm or when the majority of the firm's capital in Brazil belongs to the recipients of the royalties abroad. Re- mittances of technical assistance fees (either with or without the use of trademarks and patents) are not permitted, as a rule, when remuneration for such services exceeds specified percentages, ranging from 1 per cent to 5 per cent, of gross receipts from the sale or manufacture of given products for which such payments are incurred abroad. The percentages are the same as those established in Brazil's taxation laws for determining the maximum permissible deductions for such expenses. Travelers may take out domestic and foreign banknotes freely. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports are free of licensing requirements but require an export certificate issued by CACEX to ensure compliance with the requirements of exchange and trade regulations. Some exports are free of controls, but exports of many com- modities require prior approval of CACEX, while exports of specified commodities are prohibited, including certain pri- mary products and raw materials required for domestic con- sumption. Exports requiring approval include those effected through bilateral accounts or payable in inconvertible curren- ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ties, exports without exchange cover, exports on consign- ment, re-exports, commodities for which minimum export prices are fixed by CACEX, and exports requiring prior au- thorization by government agencies. Exports of certain com- modities, including beef, are subject to an annual quota. Exports of coffee are subject to authorization by the IBC. The IBC does not grant the authorization to export coffee unless the sale contract is based on a price per pound that is at least equal to the minimum registration price (in U.S. dollars a pound, f.o.b.) fixed from time to time by the IBC. The minimum registration price varies with the quality of the coffee and the port of shipment. Exporters of green coffee are required to surrender, without compensation, a portion of their proceeds in the form of a contribution quota. The cruzeiro proceeds from the contribution quota are transferred to the Coffee Defense Fund. The contribution quota is set from time to time by the IBC and is fixed in terms of foreign currency; on December 31, 1973 it was US$31.45 a bag. The contribution quota is adjusted whenever the exchange rate is changed in order to ensure that exporters' returns in cruzei- ros, at the minimum registration price, remain unchanged. Exporters may convert exchange proceeds, after deduction of the contribution quota, at the prevailing official market rate of exchange. Thus, the effective exchange rate for exports of coffee depends on (1) the amount of the contribution quota, (2) the actual price received (f.o.b. Brazil, in U.S. dollars a pound), and (3) the official market rate of exchange. On December 31, 1973 minimum registration prices, depend- ing on the grade of coffee and the port of shipment, were US$0.63, US$0.62, US$0.59, and US$0.575 a pound. The corresponding cruzeiro payments a bag, after deduction of the contribution quota, were Cr$319.57, Cr$311.41, Cr$286.94, and Cr$274.70. Thus the exchange rates for pro- ceeds from coffee exports on sales at the minimum registra- tion price were Cr$3.843, Cr$3.805, Cr$3.684, and Cr$3.619, per US$1. The effective exchange rate for coffee exports is higher to the extent that sales are made in excess of the minimum registration price. A special regime of individual quotas is applied for exports of soluble coffee to all markets. Proceeds of exports of spray-dried soluble coffee in excess of individual quotas are subject to a contribution quota. On December 31, 1973 the minimum registration price for spray-dried soluble coffee was US$1.26 a pound and the contribution quota was US$0.10 a pound. Thus the exchange rate for proceeds from exports of soluble coffee in excess of individual quotas on sales at the minimum registration price was Cr$5.690 per US$1; the mini- mum registration price for freeze-dried soluble coffee was US$1.91 a pound, and exports were exempt from individual quotas. The proceeds from all other exports are also sold at freely negotiated exchange rates, within the limits of the official market, but exporters of cocoa beans and cocoa products are required to surrender without compensation 10 per cent of their exchange proceeds. The cruzeiro equivalent of these deductions is used to finance a program of price support and plantation improvement for cocoa. Furthermore, a contribu- tion quota of US$500 per ton f.o.b. is levied on exports of BRAZIL fresh, chilled, or frozen beef, and of US$250 per ton f.o.b. on exports of processed beef. 3 A large number of fiscal incentives apply to exports, princi- pally of manufactured commodities. These incentives include exemptions from indirect and income taxes, customs duties, and certain fees and charges, as well as credits related to the amount of exemption from tax liability. Various lines of credit for exporters, some at preferential rates of interest, are pro- vided by the Bank of Brazil and the commercial banks. These financing facilities include both export financing and the fi- nancing of production and warehousing for export, particu- larly for manufactures. In addition, assistance is provided to exporters in the field of export credit insurance and by way of guarantees. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange proceeds from current invisibles are sold through the Bank of Brazil or the authorized banks at the prevailing market rate. Travelers checks and foreign bank- notes are sold in the "manual market." Travelers may bring in domestic and foreign currency notes freely. Capital Capital inflows in the form of financial loans under Central Bank Resolution No. 63 (as amended) or under the provision of the Foreign Investment Law (Law No. 4131) are subject to ceilings and require the prior approval of the Central Bank. The prior approval of CEMPEX is also required for borrow- ing by the public sector, when the foreign funds originate with official financial institutions abroad for borrowing by the private sector, and when the transaction is to be guaranteed by the National Treasury or, on its behalf, by any official credit institution. Moreover, import financing with credit terms exceeding 360 days in amounts over US$500,000 re- quires the prior approval of the Central Bank. Furthermore, certain borrowing abroad is subject to deposit requirements (see below). Otherwise, inward transfers are unrestricted and free of control, although the subsequent utilization of the proceeds for the acquisition of certain domestic assets may be subject to control. For the purpose of repatriation and the remittance of income, however, inward transfers of foreign capital and the reinvestment of profits on foreign capital must be registered with FIRCE. Foreign capital is defined for this purpose as (1) goods, machinery, and equipment which have entered the country without an initial corresponding expendi- ture of foreign exchange and which are to be used to produce goods or to render services, and (2) financial and monetary resources brought into the country for investment in eco- nomic pursuits, provided that, in either case, the owner is a person or firm resident or domiciled abroad or with head- quarters abroad. Foreign capital is classified, for purposes of registration, as direct investments or loans, whether imported in the form of money or of goods, and it includes reinvested profits from foreign capital. Direct investment is defined as that foreign 3 From January 21,1974, contribution quotas were applied to proceeds from exports of hides of wild animals; see footnote 2. 73 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BRAZIL capital which constitutes part of the corporate capital and participates directly in the risk inherent in an economic un- dertaking. Foreign capital that is not part of the corporate capital of any enterprise that does not participate directly in capital risk is considered to be a loan. Any loan obtained to purchase capital goods abroad, whether conceded by the manufacturer himself or by a third party, is considered to be financing (mostly suppliers* credit). Loans are considered to be cash loans when monetary or financial resources are brought into Brazil. For financial imports and for investments made in the form of goods, registration is made in the currency of the country of domicile of the creditor or investor (or of its head office) or, in special circumstances, in the currency of the country of origin of the goods or of the credit. To register loans that are made in foreign currency it is necessary to certify that the interest rate corresponds to that prevailing in the country of the lender, that the amortization schedule is not dispropor- tionately heavy in the early stages of repayment, and, in the case of import financing loans, that the prices of the imported goods correspond to the prices of comparable goods in the country of origin. If the terms of financing are approved, CACEX examines the applications for some foreign borrow- ing in the light of the price and essentiality of the proposed import and of the availability of similares nationals. The registration of direct investment is subject to the fol- lowing rules: The capital that enters or has entered Brazil is registered in foreign currency. Reinvestments are defined as profits of companies established in Brazil and accrued to persons or companies resident or domiciled abroad; such profits must have been reinvested in the same companies that produced them or in another sector of the Brazilian economy. The registration of reinvested profits is made simultaneously in Brazilian currency and in the currency of the country to which the profits could have been remitted. The conversion is calculated at the average exchange rate prevailing between the date on which the profits were earned, or appeared on the balance sheet in the case of a company, and the date of their reinvestment. Special regulations govern borrowing abroad. Under Cen- tral Bank Resolution No. 63, as amended, private commercial and investment banks and the National Bank for Economic Development may be authorized to take up foreign currency credits abroad for relending to the domestic private sector for purposes of financing working capital. The certificate of regis- tration of the loan for the purposes of the Foreign Investment Law is furnished by FIRCE upon approval of the loan by the Central Bank. Safeguards against excessive use of such credits include limitations on the foreign obligations that each bank may assume (related to the terms of the credit and the size of the bank) and the provision that the ultimate borrower must agree to bear the exchange risk. The Central Bank assures the availability of cover for the repatriation of the loan at matu- rity. All other financial loans in foreign currency are effected under the general provisions of the Foreign Investment Law (Law No. 4131). Loans under this law also require prior Central Bank authorization, but the Central Bank does not undertake to provide exchange cover for them. Loans under Resolution No. 63 as well as those under Law No. 4131 must 74 have a minimum term of six months but no maximum term is set. Under a program for the management of external debt, the National Monetary Council has since December 1971 im- posed quantitative limits on the amount of financial loans under Resolution No. 63 and Law No. 4131 for which autho- rization may be given by the Central Bank. Loans are autho- rized only if maturities conform with minimum requirements established from time to time by the Central Bank, which permits the total of loans outstanding to rise only to the extent that the servicing commitments on Brazil's total exter- nal indebtedness do not depart from the path approved by the National Monetary Council. At the end of 1973, the Central Bank's minimum acceptable maturity stood at ten years. However, provided that the full amount of the foreign ex- change remains committed to Brazil for the minimum speci- fied maturity, loans may be made to the final borrower in Brazil at terms shorter than the final maturity of the debt abroad and these funds may subsequently be re-lent to the same or a second borrower. New foreign currency loans in the form of financial credits under Resolution No. 63 and Law No. 4131 are subject to a deposit requirement of 40 per cent of the cruzeiro equivalent of the foreign exchange proceeds of loans. 4 The deposit is held at the Central Bank, which bears the exchange risk on the deposit. The deposit earns no interest, and is returned to the borrower proportionately with each amortization under the loan agreement. Loans registered prior to August 31, 1973 and renegotiated by borrowers 30 days prior to their original maturity are exempt from the deposit requirement. Renewed loans could be contracted with the original lender or with new lenders and must be consistent with the condi- tions for loans laid down by the Central Bank. Also exempt are loans from international agencies or foreign governments and suppliers' credits on imports of commodities originating in industrial countries. Banks are not permitted to pay interest on demand depos- its, whether held by residents or nonresidents. Outward capital transfers not mentioned above require authorization by GECAM, which considers applications on their merits. Approved exchange transactions involving out- ward transfers of private capital are effected through an au- thorized bank or the Bank of Brazil at the prevailing official market rate. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in Brazil. Gold mining is ruled by Law No. 4425 of Novem- ber 2, 1964. Residents other than the monetary authorities and licensed industrial users are not permitted to purchase, hold, or sell gold (other than alloys for dental use) abroad unless special permission is obtained from the Central Bank. SUMOC Instruction No. 27 of December 1948 stipulated that producers of gold must sell 20 per cent of their output to the National Treasury, through the Bank of Brazil, at the official market price, i.e., then at US$35 an ounce; the other 4 The deposit requirement on foreign borrowing was suspended with effect from February 8, 1974. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 80 per cent would remain at the free disposal of the person concerned. However, this provision was in force until Decem- ber 1962 only, and the monetary authorities do not deal in gold. The domestic negotiation of newly mined gold, which takes place at free market prices, is subject to a mining tax of 1 per cent. The mining tax may be offset against the other tax liabilities if and when gold is manufactured. The import Table of Exchange Rates(as at December 31, 1973)5 BRAZIL of gold is subject to the issuance of an import certificate by CACEX; imports of native gold and of gold in the form of powder are free of customs duty.

IBC Resolution 684 suspended, with effect from February 5, registrations of exports of soluble coffee, in any form, for shipments up to March 31. Minimum prices for exports of soluble coffee for the period April 1-June 30 were fixed as follows: US$1.08 a pound for spray-dried soluble coffee, and US$1.20 a pound for freeze-dried soluble coffee. Remittances abroad of agents9 commissions were limited to 5 per cent of the gross sale price. A regime of individual export quotas for soluble coffee for all markets was estab- lished for sales whose shipments were expected to take place between April 1 and June 30. A contribution quota on ex- ports of soluble coffee in any form was introduced; it was set at the equivalent of 15 per cent of the minimum registration 5 Excluding brokerage fees. 6 The minimum registration price (in U.S. dollars a pound) varies with the quality of the coffee and the port of shipment. During 1973, exports of coffee usually took place at prices in excess of the minimum registration price. The rates shown make allowance for payment of the contribution quota, which on December 31, 1973 was US$31.45 a bag. 7 Different effective rates arise from the application of a contribution quota of US$500 a ton f.o.b. to proceeds from exports of fresh, chilled, or frozen beef, and one of US$250 a ton to proceeds from exports of processed beef. From January 21, 1974, contribution quotas were also levied on exports of raw, tanned, or processed hides of wild animals. 8 A different effective rate applies to certain remittances of profits and dividends (see section on Payments for Invisibles, above). 6.220 ("ManualMarket"Rate) Foreign bankno tes and travelers checks. 6.220 (Official Market Rate) Imports.

The central rate is K 4.8138 per US$1, corresponding to K 5.80717 = SDR 1, and Burma avails itself of wider margins. On Decem- ber 31, 1973 the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar of the Union of Burma Bank, the sole authorized dealer in foreign exchange, were K 4.8138 and K 4.9100, respectively, per U.S. dollar, and the Bank's buying and selling rates for sterling were K 13.9372 and K 14.2159, respectively, per £ stg. 1. The buying rate for sterling was subject to a commis- sion of 15 per cent .l Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Exchange Control Board in accordance with instructions from the Ministry of Planning and Finance, through the Exchange Control De- partment of the Union of Burma Bank. A Foreign Exchange Control Committee headed by the Minister of Planning and Finance is in charge of the allocation of foreign exchange to the public sector. Exports are handled by the Myanma Ex- port-Import Corporation (MEIC or Trade Corporation No. 22). The MEIC also imports goods for the use of the private sector, whose requirements are determined by the Central Trade Council. Government agencies and departments make imports of goods for their own use, including imports under loan and aid agreements, in the name of the MEIC. Most payments for imports are made in accordance with an annual foreign exchange budget drawn up by the Ministry of Plan- ning and Finance. Prescription of Currency Certain settlements with Bangladesh are channeled through a nonresident bank account at the Union of Burma Bank. Payments to other countries may be made in any for- eign currency or by crediting kyats to an External Account in Burma. Receipts must be collected in convertible curren- cies or to the debit of an External Account in Burma. Imports and Import Payments An import program is drawn up annually as part of the foreign exchange budget. All imports are made by, or in the name of, the MEIC. All imports from Rhodesia and South Africa are prohibited. Also prohibited are imports of a few commodities from any source—principally opium and similar narcotics, monkeys, playing cards, and gold and silver bul- lion. Imports of consumer goods are severely restricted. Most imports are purchased on an f.o.b. basis, and shipments are made on vessels owned or chartered by the Burma Five Star Line whenever possible. All payments for imports are made through the Union of Burma Bank. 1 Increased to 20 per cent on January 18, 1974. All payments for invisibles are subject to licensing. In gen- eral, payments for items connected with foreign trade are allowed automatically, and payments for most other pur- poses are considered on a case-by-case basis. Payments for membership fees to educational or technical institutions abroad and payments for subscriptions to certain foreign periodicals are as a rule allowed freely. Family remittances are permitted only by foreign municipal workers or foreign technicians employed under contract by the Government, the limit being one half of the net salary if the wife is living abroad, and one third of the net salary if the wife is living in Burma. Remittances of income resulting from investment other than that guaranteed under the Investment Act have been suspended. The remittance of pension payments to re- tired government employees who served the Government as Burmese nationals but took up foreign citizenship before de- parture from Burma is not permitted. Most personal money order remittances to neighboring countries through post of- fices are not permitted. Foreign exchange allocations for tourist travel by residents have been suspended. However, residents granted an official permit to go abroad for any other purpose may take out freely the equivalent of K 50 in the currency of the country of destination (except India) or, if that currency is not available, in sterling notes or U.S. dollar notes. At present, Burmese nationals are not allowed to travel abroad except on official missions or for employment abroad. On leaving, nonresident travelers who have stayed in the country for less than six months may take out any foreign currency they still hold and may also reconvert the amount of foreign currency which they had converted into kyats. The export of Burmese cur- rency is prohibited. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports are effected by the MEIC. There is a list of prohibited exports which comprises iron and steel, brass, copper, and aluminum and scraps thereof, foreign manufac- tures, and commodities of domestic origin the conservation of which is desired for domestic requirements. All exports to Rhodesia and South Africa are prohibited. Export proceeds must be obtained in a manner satisfactory to the exchange control authorities; the exchange must be surrendered to the Union of Burma Bank within six months from the date of shipment. When exports are made on an f.o.b. basis, buyers are free to choose the carrier, but exports on a c.i.f. basis are usually shipped by the Burma Five Star Line or on vessels nominated by it. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles must be surrendered. Travelers may bring in, subject to declaration, any amount in foreign currency; foreign nationals who intend to stay for more than six months must surrender all foreign exchange in 79 ©International Monetary Fund.

The import, export, and transfer of securities involving nonresident interests require individual licenses. Capital Foreign investments in Burma are governed by the provi- sions of the Union of Burma Bank Investment Act, 1959 and the Investment Rules of February 25, 1960 issued under au- thority of the Act. Investment proposals are to be considered by an Investment Committee to ascertain whether the pro- posed enterprise will utilize domestic raw materials, increase domestic employment, conserve foreign exchange, and gener- ally conform to the economic plans of the Government. No private investments have been made under the Act; since February 15, 1963, when the Government announced a new policy of nationalization, permission has not been granted for any foreign private investment in Burma. The investment law provides for the transfer abroad of profits after taxes and for the withdrawal of imported capital at any time after five years from the time of entry, in annual quotas not exceeding 25 per cent of its original value. In principle, proceeds from the liquidation or sale of an enter- prise may also be transferred abroad. All such transfers may, subject to prior approval, be made at the official rate of exchange prevailing at the time of the transaction. However, transfers of capital proceeds from the voluntary liquidation of foreign companies were suspended in July 1963. All outward transfers of capital require prior approval. Residents are not permitted to remit funds abroad for invest- ment. The repatriation of personal assets and the making of family remittances have been suspended, with minor excep- tions, for foreign nationals employed in the private sector; those employed in the public sector may remit their personal savings when leaving the service. When the transfer abroad of payments in favor of nonresidents is not permitted, the authorities can allow such payments to be credited to kyat nonresident accounts. All debits and credits to such accounts Gold Residents may hold and negotiate gold jewelry, gold coins, and unworked gold in Burma. Licenses for imports and ex- ports of gold are not granted unless they are effected by or on behalf of the monetary authorities of Burma. Jewelry for personal wear may be brought into Burma subject to customs declaration at the port of arrival. The export of personal jewelry is permitted under license, subject to the condition that the jewelry will be repatriated. No conditions are at- tached, however, to the taking out of personal jewelry that was declared to the customs when it was brought into Burma. Changes during 1973 February 13. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Burma maintained the gold value of the kyat; the central rate, previously K 5.3487 = US$1, became K 4.8138 = US$1. Burma continued to avail itself of wider margins. March 5. The Union of Burma Bank increased from 10 per cent to 15 per cent the commission levied since October 31, 1972 on purchases of sterling. The Bank introduced a com- mission of 10 per cent on purchases of U.S. dollars; this commission was discontinued on March 22. November 77. A Foreign Exchange Control Committee headed by the Minister of Planning and Finance was insti- tuted to supervise the use of foreign exchange by the public sector. December 6. It was announced that compensation would be paid in respect of Burmese and foreign-owned private busi- ness enterprises nationalized since 1963.

Not for Redistribution BURUNDI Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.00935443 gram of f ine gold per Burundi Franc, corresponding to FBu 95 = SDR 1 or FBu 78.7501 = US$1, and Burundi avails itself of wider margins. The exchange rates quoted by the Bank of the Republic of Bu- rundi (the central bank) for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, are fixed at FBu 78.35 buying, and FBu 79.15 selling, per US$1. The Bank quotes buying and selling rates for the Belgian franc based on the fixed rates for the U.S. dollar and the official market rates for U.S. dollars in Brus- sels; the Bank also quotes buying and selling rates for other specified currencies 1 which are based either on its quoted rates for the Belgian franc and the official market rates for the currencies concerned in Brussels, or, for the Kenya shilling, the Rwanda franc, the Tanzania shilling, and the zaire, on their parities. Authorized banks must carry out permitted exchange transactions at the buying and selling rates established by the Bank of the Republic of Burundi for currencies quoted by that Bank; they may agree rates freely with their customers for Uganda shillings. Buying rates lower than FBu 78.35 per U.S. dollar apply to proceeds from coffee exports shipped via Kigoma, when the time between shipment and delivery of the foreign exchange exceeds three calendar months. Administration of Control Control over foreign exchange transactions and foreign trade is vested in the Bank of the Republic of Burundi; au- thority to carry out some transactions is delegated to three authorized banks. Prescription of Currency Outgoing payments may be made in any currency; receipts must be obtained in one of the currencies quoted by the Bank of the Republic of Burundi. Nonresident Accounts Nonresident Accounts in Burundi Francs may be main- tained, subject to the approval of the central bank, by (1) physical persons of foreign nationality who are temporarily established in Burundi and are not considered as residents, such as diplomats, and (2) juridical persons of foreign nation- ality with special status, such as foreign embassies and inter- national organizations. These accounts may be credited freely with the proceeds of foreign currencies quoted by the central bank and they may be debited freely for withdrawals of Bu- rundi francs for any normal current payments in Burundi and for conversion into foreign exchange (except banknotes). All other debits and credits require the prior approval of the central bank. These accounts cannot bear interest and must not be overdrawn. 1 Austrian schillings, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Kenya shillings, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Rwanda francs, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, Tanzania shillings, U.S. dollars, and zaires. Certain nonresidents may maintain Nonresident Accounts in Foreign Currencies with an authorized bank. The opening of such accounts requires the approval of the central bank and is restricted to (1) physical persons of foreign nationality who are resident abroad and (2) juridical persons having branches or subsidiaries abroad. These accounts may be cred- ited freely with any foreign currency quoted by the Bank of the Republic that is received from abroad. They may be debited freely for (1) conversion into Burundi francs required to pay any expenses in Burundi and (2) payments abroad for travel and representation or for the purchase price of foreign goods. These accounts cannot bear interest and must not be overdrawn; the related bank charges and commissions may be settled in Burundi francs. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. All imports except trade samples and merchan- dise not intended for sale and valued up to FBu 20,000 re- quire licenses; these are issued freely, except for certain used clothing. Applications for licenses must be submitted to the Bank of the Republic of Burundi on a form entitled Import License and Payment Authorization. The approval of such an application constitutes an authorization also to obtain foreign exchange. With certain exceptions, applications for amounts under FBu 100,000 are approved by the authorized banks. Import licenses must be presented to the customs officials when the goods are cleared through customs. The license is valid for a period of seven months starting at the end of the month following that of validation; in special cases, exten- sions may be granted by the central bank. The number and date of expiration of the license must be entered on the cus- toms clearance form, the Consumption Declaration, a copy of which is then sent to the central bank by the customs office. Advance deposits calculated on the c.i.f. value are required for certain luxury goods from private sector importers. The deposit on such commodities is 100 per cent; it is not re- quired, however, when the goods are imported in small amounts, i.e., when the amount of the license is less than FBu 10,000. The deposit must be made at the time the import license is validated; it is released when the import payment is made. In principle, foreign exchange is made available at the time of shipment of the goods. For certain prime necessities, however, documentary credits may be opened for which ex- change is supplied immediately. For goods under global li- censes, foreign exchange is not made available until after customs clearance. All imports are subject to a statistical tax of 3 per cent ad valorem, in addition to any applicable cus- toms duties and fiscal duties. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require approval. Shipping in- surance on coffee exports normally must be taken out in Burundi francs with brokers or insurers established in Bu- rundi. Transfers of earnings of foreign nationals are freely permitted upon proof of payment of taxes, up to 60 per cent 81 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution BURUNDI of net annual income, depending on the amount of such in- come; this regime applies to earnings under a labor contract, to income earned in a profession, and to profits earned by any enterprise operated by an individual or a partnership. Private joint-stock companies may freely transfer 50 per cent of net declared profits after taxes to their foreign nonresident stock- holders or to stockholders who are resident foreign nationals; however, approved enterprises may obtain a guarantee of full transferability of net declared profits. Persons leaving Bu- rundi permanently are authorized to transfer abroad their holdings of Burundi francs that consist of unremitted savings or of the proceeds of the sale of their personal effects. Transfer of income from rental properties to nonresident owners of foreign nationality is permitted up to 50 per cent of net rental income (after payment of taxes and deduction of 20 per cent for maintenance expenses); resident owners of foreign nation- ality may remit the same proportion of such income. Resi- dents of Burundi nationality may purchase needed amounts of exchange for foreign travel. All travelers may take out up to FBu 2,000 in Burundi banknotes. In addition, residents may freely purchase foreign travel tickets up to reasonable amounts against payment in Burundi francs. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. All exports valued at over FBu 3,000 are subject to a prior declaration entitled Declaration of Collection of Foreign Exchange. The Declaration must be presented for certification by the central bank through an authorized bank, with the exception of those for cotton, which may be certified by authorized banks; for coffee exports, the central bank's visa is dependent on the prior advice of the Coffee Committee. Declarations are valid for six months, but extensions may be granted by the central bank. Payments must be collected not later than 45 days after the goods have left the country when they are sold to neighboring countries, and not later than 90 days for goods shipped to other destinations. All exchange proceeds from exports must be surrendered to an authorized bank within 8 days from their collection. However, unfavor- able exchange rates are applied when surrender of export proceeds of coffee occurs more than three months after ship- ment. Virtually all exports, including coffee, are subject to export taxes and a statistical tax. Exports of manufactured goods may receive a refund of 3 per cent of the f.o.b. value, provided that they incorporate raw materials on which im- port duty has been paid. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles must be surrendered to authorized banks. Travelers may bring in any amount of foreign banknotes and up to FBu 2,000 in Burundi bank- notes. Capital The Investment Code of August 25,1967 provides for fiscal and other benefits for domestic and foreign private investors. New investment that fulfills specified conditions as to amount 82 and economic importance may be granted priority status to which specified privileges are attached, mainly in the form of exemptions from import duties and from taxes on income from the investment. Import duties and taxes may be reduced or suspended for goods and equipment needed for starting a particular project and, during a period of 5 years, for other merchandise needed for the manufacturing operation or for the upkeep of the original investment. Taxes on profits and real estate may be likewise reduced or suspended. Enterprises which are granted priority status may obtain protection against foreign competition, priority in the allocation of gov- ernment contracts, and a guarantee from the central bank for the free transfer of profits and dividends as well as the repatri- ation of the invested capital. In addition to these privileges, companies undertaking investments that are considered to be of prime importance to Burundi's economic development may be granted, under a separate convention, a guarantee that direct taxes on their activities will not be increased for a period of up to 15 years. An Investment Commission under the Minister of Planning is charged with examining requests for priority status and granting the necessary authorization. Capital transfers by residents require individual authoriza- tion, which is rarely given, except in the case of foreign capital on which a repatriation guarantee has been granted. The guarantee is given to foreign exchange imported in any of the currencies quoted by the central bank by resident enterprises for working capital purposes and is valid for one year from the date on which the exchange is surrendered to the central bank through an authorized bank. The guarantee provides for the transfer of the original amount surrendered at the official rate ruling on the day of transfer. Gold Dealings in gold coins must be carried out through the central bank. All other private dealing in gold is prohibited. The central bank purchases unrefined gold from domestic producers at FBu 135 a gram. After refining abroad, this gold is included in the official monetary reserves. Imports and exports of gold may be made only by the central bank, with the exception that private firms may be licensed to import gold for dental use. Changes during 1973 January 9. The central bank's purchasing price for unre- fined gold was increased from FBu 100 to FBu 135 a gram. February 20. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Burundi decided to maintain the par value of its currency unchanged in terms of gold. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously FBu 87.50 = US$1, became FBu 78.7501 = US$1. March 20. The Bank of the Republic quoted the zaire on the basis of its parity. August 8. New regulations were issued for exports of the 1973/74 coffee crop (Central Bank Communication No. 66 Rt. C/EXP.). Authorized banks would maintain control of shipments until the foreign exchange settlement took place; shipping documents, therefore, had to be made out to the order of the bank concerned. Each contract normally had to ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution provide for the opening of an irrevocable documentary credit. The exchange rates applicable to the foreign exchange pro- ceeds were as follows: If delivery of foreign currency took place within three months of shipment to Kigoma, the spot buying rate on the date of surrender (at that time FBu 78.35 per US$1); if surrender took place between three and four calendar months after shipment, the spot buying rate minus a discount of 0.6 per cent (i.e., for U.S. dollars, FBu 77.88 per US$1); if surrender took place after four to five months, the discount applied would be 1.5 per cent (i.e., the rate for U.S. dollars would be FBu 77.17 per US$1); and for surrender more than five months after shipment, the discount would be 1.5 per cent plus a discount of 1 per cent per month or part of a month. October 15. The Bank of the Republic quoted the Kenya shilling on the basis of its parity. BURUNDI 83 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CAMEROON Exchange System No par value for the currency of Cameroon has been estab- lished with the Fund. The unit of currency is the CFA Franc,l which is officially maintained at the rate of CFAF 1 = 0.02 French franc. Exchange transactions in French francs, the intervention currency, between the Banque des Etats de 1'Afrique Centrale (BEAC) and commercial banks take place at the rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02, free of commission. Exchange transactions relating to foreign countries, i.e., countries other than France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories except the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries of the French Franc Area, take place in a dual exchange market, at rates based on the fixed rate for the French franc and the Paris exchange rate for the foreign currency concerned in either the official exchange market or the financial franc mar- ket. Settlements eligible for the official exchange market are payments and receipts in respect of imports, exports, and most other current transactions, as well as all current pay- ments by or in favor of domestic and foreign public authori- ties and public bodies. All other settlements with foreign countries, as well as transactions in banknotes of foreign countries and banknotes issued by the BEAC, take place through the financial franc market at freely fluctuating rates. The principal current payments and receipts channeled through the financial franc market are those relating to travel expenses, capital earnings, and workers' remittances. Ex- change rates for certain European currencies in the official market are based on par values and central rates; the effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar in this market is not confined within any announced margins. With the exception of those relating to gold, Cameroon's exchange control measures do not apply to (1) France (as defined above) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Opera- tions Account (the Central African Republic, Chad, the Peo- ple's Republic of the Congo, Dahomey, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Togo, and Upper Volta). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries, except Cameroon itself, are considered foreign countries, and in principle, financial relations only with for- eign countries are subject to exchange control. All financial transfers to countries of the French Franc Area must be declared to the authorities for statistical purposes. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Sub-Directorate of Financial Operations in the Directorate of Economic Con- trols, Ministry of Finance, which also surpervises borrowing and lending abroad, the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Cameroon, and inward and out- ward direct investment. All exchange transactions relating to 1 The CFA franc circulating in Cameroon is issued by the Banque des Etats de 1'Afrique Centrale (BEAC) and is legal tender also in the Central African Republic, Chad, the People's Republic of the Congo, and Gabon. 84 foreign countries must be effected through authorized inter- mediaries, i.e., the Postal Administration and authorized banks. Import and export licenses are issued by the Ministry of Industrial and Commercial Development. Prescription of Currency Cameroon is an Operations Account country of the French Franc Area, since the BEAC maintains an Operations Ac- count with the French Treasury; settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the other Operations Account countries of the French Franc Area are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other Operations Ac- count country. Settlements with all other countries are usu- ally made through correspondent banks in France in any of the currencies of those countries or in French francs through Foreign or Financial Accounts in Francs. All settlements between Cameroon and Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Af- rica are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. BEAC banknotes may be credited to Financial Accounts in Francs when mailed direct to the BEAC agency in Yaounde by the foreign correspon- dents of authorized banks. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. The import from all sources of certain "con- trolled" goods requires a special authorization (autorisation speciale d'importation); when these goods are imported from countries other than France or the Operations Ac- count countries of the French Franc Area and are valued at CFAF 25,000 or more, they require in addition an import license. The import of rice, flour, and sugar is subject to special procedures. Other imports from France and the Oper- ations Account countries in the French Franc Area do not require a license. All other imports are subject to licensing, but licenses are issued freely. All import transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value ex- ceeds CFAF 50,000. Import licenses entitle importers to pur- chase the necessary exchange, provided that the shipping documents are submitted to the authorized bank. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Mo- naco, and the other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to the approval of the Ministry of Fi- nance. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution are also permitted freely when the basic transaction has been approved. For tourist travel, residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the other Operations Account countries of the French Franc Area may obtain an exchange allocation of an amount equivalent to CFAF 200,000 a person a year; any foreign exchange remain- ing after return to Cameroon must be surrendered. For busi- ness travel to foreign countries, there is an allocation of the equivalent of CFAF 15,000 a day, subject to a maximum of CFAF 450,000 a trip. The transfer of rent from real property owned in Cameroon by foreign nationals is limited in principle to 50 per cent of the income declared for taxation purposes. Remittances for current repair and management of real property abroad are normally limited to the equivalent of CFAF 200,000 every two or three years. The transfer of 20 per cent or 50 per cent of the salary of a foreigner working in Cameroon is permitted upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher, provided that the transfer takes place within one month of the pay period concerned. Except in the case of foreigners working in Cameroon temporarily, payments to foreign countries of in- surance premiums are not permitted if the same type of insur- ance is available in Cameroon. Resident and nonresident travelers going to foreign countries may take out up to a maximum of CFAF 20,000 in BEAC banknotes. Travelers to other countries may take out any amount in BEAC bank- notes. Nonresident travelers may take out foreign banknotes and coins up to the amount declared by them on entry, or up to CFAF 50,000 if no declaration was made. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. Export transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank when valued at CFAF 50,000 or more. Exports to countries in the French Franc Area are free of license. Proceeds from exports to for- eign countries must be collected within 90 days of the date of arrival at their destination and proceeds received in curren- cies other than those of France or an Operations Account country must be surrendered within a month after collection. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be collected within a month of the due date and surrendered within a month of collection if received in foreign currency. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of banknotes and coins issued by the BEAC, the Bank of France, or a bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign banknotes and coins (except gold coins) of countries outside the French Franc Area. CAMEROON Capital Capital movements between Cameroon and France (as de- fined above), Monaco, and other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require ex- change control approval and are restricted, but capital re- ceipts from such countries are permitted freely. Emigrants to foreign countries may transfer abroad their full savings, pro- vided that they have met their tax obligations. Special controls (additional to any exchange control re- quirements that may be applicable) are maintained over bor- rowing and lending abroad, over inward and outward direct investment, and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Cameroon; these controls relate to the transactions themselves, not to payments or receipts. With the exception of those over the sale or introduction of foreign securities in Cameroon, the control measures do not apply to relations with France (as defined above), Monaco, and those other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account. The provi- sions of Decree No. 67/DF/365, which introduced these spe- cial controls, have been suspended insofar as they are contrary to Decree No. 68/DF/460, on which the present exchange controls are based. All foreign securities, foreign exchange, and titles embodying claims on nonresidents must be deposited with an authorized intermediary, whether they belong to residents or nonresidents. Direct investments abroad 2 require the prior approval of the Ministry of Finance, unless they take the form of a capital increase resulting from reinvestment of undistributed profits; the full or partial liquidation of such investments requires only a report ex post to the Minister of Finance, unless the operation involves the relinquishing of a participation that had previously been approved as constituting the making of a direct investment abroad. Foreign direct investments in Cameroon 3 require prior declaration to the Minister of Fi- nance, unless they take the form of a capital increase resulting from reinvestment of undistributed profits; the Minister has a period of two months from receipt of the declaration during which he may request the postponement of the projects sub- mitted to him. The full or partial liquidation of direct invest- ments in Cameroon requires only reporting ex post to the Minister of Finance, unless the operation involves the relin- quishing of a participation that had previously been approved as constituting the making of a direct investment in Came- roon. Both the making and the liquidation of direct invest- ments, whether these are Cameroonian investments abroad or foreign investments in Cameroon, must be reported to the Minister of Finance within 20 days following each operation. Direct investments are defined as investments implying con- trol of a company or enterprise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 per cent of the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. 3 Including those made through the intermediary of foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controUed by persons in Cameroon and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Cameroon. 3 Including those made by companies in Cameroon that are directly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in Cameroon of foreign companies. 85 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CAMEROON The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign secu- rities in Cameroon requires prior authorization by the Minis- ter of Finance, and must subsequently be reported to him. Exempt from authorization, however, and subject only to an ex post report, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Cameroonian Government, and (2) shares similar to securities whose issue, advertising, or offering for sale in Cameroon has previously been autho- rized. Borrowing abroad by physical or juridical persons, whether public or private persons, whose normal residence or registered office is in Cameroon, or by branches or subsidiar- ies in Cameroon of juridical persons whose registered office is abroad, requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance, and must subsequently be reported to him. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization, and require only a report ex post: (1) loans constituting a direct investment abroad for which prior approval has been ob- tained, as indicated above; (2) loans directly connected with the rendering of services abroad by the persons or firms men- tioned above, or with the financing of commercial transac- tions either between Cameroon and countries abroad or between foreign countries, in which these persons or firms take part; (3) loans contracted by registered banks and credit institutions; and (4) loans other than those mentioned above, when the total amount outstanding of these loans does not exceed CFAF 50 million for any one borrower, their duration does not exceed two years, and the rate of interest does not exceed 6 per cent a year. Lending abroad by physical and juridical persons, whether public or private persons, whose normal residence or regis- tered office is in Cameroon, or by branches or subsidiaries in Cameroon of juridical persons whose registered office is abroad, requires prior authorization by the Minister of Fi- nance and must subsequently be reported to him. The follow- ing are, however, exempt from prior authorization and are subject only to a report ex post: (1) loans constituting a direct investment abroad for which prior approval has been ob- tained, as indicated above; (2) loans directly connected with the rendering of services abroad by the persons or firms men- tioned above, or with the financing of commercial transac- tions either between Cameroon and countries abroad or between foreign countries, in which these persons or firms take part; and (3) loans contracted by registered banks and credit institutions. An Investment Code promulgated in 1960 and revised in April 1964 establishes four categories of fiscal and other bene- fits which may be granted to both foreign and domestic firms undertaking approved new industrial or agricultural projects in Cameroon. The scope and duration of the benefits vary depending on the size of the investment, the degree to which it helps implement the economic and social development plan, and its importance to national economic growth. Cate- gory A permits mainly duty-free entry of capital goods and raw materials required for manufacturing and processing. Under Category B, firms may be entitled to the benefits of Category A and also to exemption for 5 years from the tax 86 on industrial and commercial profits and from various other taxes and fees. Under Category C, large companies may con- clude an "establishment agreement" with the Government, under which special conditions for the operations of the com- pany are agreed and the nature and extent of tax concessions are determined. Normally, an "establishment agreement" is valid for 25 years and defines also the legal, economic, and financial guarantees granted to the company, including the assurance of stable conditions for financial transfers and mar- keting of goods. Category D grants to firms making invest- ments of particular significance to the national economy the benefits of Category C, as well as a guarantee of stability of taxation for up to 25 years. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold jewelry in Cameroon. They require the approval of the Direc- torate of Mines to hold gold in any other form. Approval is normally given only to industrial users, including jewelers. Newly mined gold must be declared to the Directorate of Mines, which authorizes either its exportation or its sale to domestic industrial users; exports are made only to France. Imports and exports of gold require prior authorization by the Directorate of Mines and the Minister of Finance, which is seldom granted for imports. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, and (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles). Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Changes during 1973 February 13. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the exchange rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02 was maintained; the effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously CFAF 255.785 = US$1, became CFAF 230.207 = US$1. March 19. With the entry into effect of new margins ar- rangements between the French franc and certain other Euro- pean currencies, and the maintenance of the exchange rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02, the CFA franc began to appreciate in terms of the U.S. dollar. April 2. The Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique Equatoriale et du Cameroon (BCEAEC) was replaced by the Banque des Etats de 1'Afrique Centrale (BEAC). July. The exchange control regulations applicable to for- eign countries became applicable also to the Malagasy Re- public and Mauritania. September 5. For statistical purposes only, all financial transfers to countries of the French Franc Area had to be declared to the authorities. December 13. Circular No. 21 raised the floor value for the domiciliation of imports from countries outside the French Franc Area from CFAF 25,000 to CFAF 50,000. It also provided new regulations concerning the collection and sur- render of export proceeds. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Exchange Rate System Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles CANADA The par value is 0.822021 gram of fine gold per Canadian Dollar. Since May 31,1970, however, the authorities have not maintained the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar within prescribed margins, and therefore all transactions, for the time being, take place at a fluctuating exchange rate. The closing free market rate for the U.S. dollar on December 31, 1973 was Can$0.9906 per US$1. Canada has no exchange restrictions on foreign payments other than certain restric- tions on payments to Rhodesia. On March 25, 1952, Canada notified the Fund that it was prepared to accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Prescription of Currency No prescription of currency requirements are in force. In implementation of UN Security Council Resolution No. 253(68) of May 29,1968, payments and transfers to Rhodesia are restricted. Imports and Import Payments Payments and transfers abroad may be made freely. Import licenses are required only for certain drugs, for a few agricul- tural items, including certain cereals, for certain textile prod- ucts, for natural gas, and for material and equipment for the production or use of atomic energy. For some of the agricul- tural items, such as certain dairy products, licenses are gener- ally not being issued. Commercial imports of certain commodities from any source are generally prohibited; these include oleomargarine, used automobiles, secondhand air- craft, certain periodicals, and goods of Rhodesian origin. Exports and Export Proceeds The surrender of the proceeds from exports is not required, and exchange receipts are freely disposable. For supply rea- sons, the export of a few commodities to all destinations is under export control, as is the export to the United States of crude petroleum, certain petroleum products, and natural gas. For security reasons, the export of certain specified com- modities to all destinations except the United States is under export control. All exports to Albania, Bulgaria, the Peo- ple's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany and East Berlin, Hungary, North Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Rhodesia, Romania, North Viet-Nam, and the U.S.S.R. are subject to control, although certain goods of Canadian origin may be exported to these destinations, with the exception of Rhodesia, under the authority of a general export permit. The export of all goods to Rhodesia is prohibited, except medical supplies, news material, educational equipment and materials for use in educational institutions, and books, magazines, and periodicals. No requirements are imposed on exchange payments for, or exchange receipts from, invisibles. However, travelers may not take out any Canadian silver coins minted in or prior to 1968. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or payments by residents or nonresidents. Certain nonmandatory guidelines were issued in 1966 and 1968, mainly to prevent Canada from being used as a "pass- through" channel for outflows of U.S. capital to countries other than the United States, but also to prevent an excessive inflow of long-term capital, particularly from the United States. They apply to (1) all Canadian investors, with respect to the acquisition of "offshore" securities issued by U.S. com- panies and their foreign subsidiaries for sale outside the United States; (2) chartered banks and other financial institu- tions with respect to their foreign assets and liabilities; and (3) companies incorporated in Canada with respect to trans- fers of capital to overseas countries. The principal exemptions from these guidelines relate to export financing designed to facilitate Canadian exports, and to Canadian dollar term loans to, and Canadian dollar securities issued or guaranteed by, the central governments or central banks of developing countries.1 The Minister of Finance and the Bank of Canada have asked Canadian borrowers to carefully explore the po- tentialities of the Canadian market before offering securities for sale abroad. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad. Under the Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act of 1948, all mines receiving subsidies are re- quired to sell their newly mined gold to the Royal Canadian Mint at US$42.22 a fine ounce. After refining, this gold is disposed of in the free market to established wholesale dealers by the Bank of Canada, acting as agent for the Government. Unsubsidized mines may sell their output on the free market. Exports of gold are subject to the following conditions: (1) exports to Albania, Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany and East Berlin, Hungary, North Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Rhodesia, Romania, North Viet-Nam, and the U.S.S.R. are included among those ex- ports subject to control and require a license from the De- partment of Industry, Trade and Commerce; (2) gold of U.S. origin may only be re-exported from Canada when covered by a permit issued by the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce under the authority of the Export and Import Permits Act; and (3) owing to the general embargo on trade with Rhodesia, movements of gold to or from Rhodesia are prohibited. Commercial imports of articles containing minor 1 The 1968 guidelines were revoked on January 30, 1974. All remaining guidelines with respect to capital outflows or "pass-through" flows were withdrawn on February 11, 1974. 87 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CANADA quantities of gold, such as watches, are unrestricted and free of license. Changes during 1973 January 24. A proposed Foreign Investment Review Act was introduced in Parliament. It obtained Royal Assent on December 12 but by the end of 1973 had not come into force. The Act provided that the acquisition of control over a Cana- dian business enterprise by noneligible persons, or the estab- lishment by them in Canada of a new business unrelated to any business which they might already be carrying on in Canada, was subject to control by the Government. The review process for take-overs would be instituted within 180 days of Royal Assent. Screening of the establishment of new businesses would begin later. The Foreign Investment Review Agency had not been formally established by the end of the year. January 31. The trade agreements with the United King- dom, including the remaining provisions of the Ottawa Agreement of 1932, expired. February 15. Exports of crude oil were made subject to quota restriction. Controls instituted by the National Energy Board took effect on March 1. February 19. Temporary import duty reductions went into effect which averaged 5 percentage points on imports valued in 1972 at almost Can$1.3 billion. (The duty on beef and live cattle was restored on September 21.) February 20. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the Canadian authorities stated that they would continue to allow basic market forces to determine the value of the Canadian dollar and that the Bank of Canada would continue to restrict its intervention to main- taining an orderly market. April 5. Exports of Canadian silver coins minted in or prior to 1968 were placed under control. May 11. Banks were asked to pay particular attention to the needs of small businesses and to applications for credit in the slower growth regions of the country, and to give priority to the creditworthy needs of their Canadian customers rather than respond to unusual requests from foreign corporations or foreign-owned subsidiaries in Canada for funds for use abroad or to replace funds that would normally be obtained abroad. June 15. Exports of gasoline and heating oil were re- stricted. June 16. The system of discretionary licensing of imports of motor gasoline was abolished. June 29. Export controls were imposed on soybeans, lin- seed, rapeseed, cottonseed, and their oils and by-products.

Exports of petroleum to the United States were further reduced on December 1, 1973. October 15. Export controls were imposed on propane gas, butane gas, and heavy fuel oils. October 18. The buying price of the Royal Canadian Mint for newly produced gold was increased from US$38 to US$42.22 an ounce. October 20. The export controls over agricultural protein commodities imposed on June 29 and July 9, and those over live cattle, hogs, beef, and pork imposed on August 14, were removed. November 2. The Canadian Commercial Corporation was authorized to purchase crude petroleum abroad. December 2. Minimum export prices were imposed on nat- ural gas. December 20. Guidelines were issued governing take-overs of Canadian businesses in the interim period until the Foreign Investment Review Act would come into effect. The guide- lines took effect immediately. 88 ©International Monetary Fund.

Exchange transactions in French francs, the intervention currency, between the Banque des Etats de FAfrique Centrale (BEAC) and commer- cial banks take place at the rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02, free of commission. Exchange transactions relating to foreign countries, i.e., countries other than France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories except the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries of the French Franc Area, take place in a dual market, at rates based on the fixed rate for the French franc and the Paris exchange rate for the foreign currency concerned in either the official exchange market or the financial franc market. Settle- ments eligible for the official exchange market are payments and receipts in respect of imports, exports, and most other current transactions, as well as all current payments by or in favor of domestic and foreign public authorities and public bodies. All other settlements with foreign countries, as well as transactions in banknotes of foreign countries and bank- notes issued by the BEAC, take place through the financial franc market at freely fluctuating rates. The principal current payments and receipts channeled through the financial franc market are those relating to travel expenses, capital earnings, and workers' remittances. Exchange rates for certain Euro- pean currencies in the official market are based on par values and central rates; the effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar in this market is not confined within any announced margins. An exchange tax of 2l/2 per cent (subject to a minimum of CFAF 500) is levied on most exchange transactions with, and payments to, countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries. In addition to payments to the countries mentioned, the following are exempt: (1) transactions of less than CFAF 12,500; (2) all operations relating to foreign exchange receipts; (3) foreign currency allowances for travel to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, or the Operations Account countries; (4) government expenditures in countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, or the Operations Account countries; (5) transactions of international organiza- tions and embassies; and (6) transactions carried out with the member countries of the EEC.

All other countries, except the Central African Republic itself, are con- sidered foreign countries, and in principal financial relations only with foreign countries are subject to exchange control. Administration of Control All draft legislation, directives, correspondence, and con- tracts having a direct or indirect bearing on the finances of the State require the prior approval of the Minister of Fi- nance, who has delegated this approval authority to the Di- rector of the Budget. The Office of Foreign Financial Relations in the Ministry of Finance supervises borrowing and lending abroad, the issuing, advertising, or sale of foreign securities in the Central African Republic, and inward and outward direct investment. Exchange control is administered by the Minister of Finance, who has delegated some of his approval authority to the BEAC, 2 to the authorized banks, and to the Postal Administration. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through autho- rised banks. Import and export licenses are issued by the Directorate of Foreign Trade in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, except those for gold, which are granted by the Ministry of Mines and Geology. Prescription of Currency The Central African Republic is an Operations Account country of the French Franc Area, since the BEAC maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury; settle- ments with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the other Operations Account countries of the French Franc Area are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury. Settlements with all other countries are usually made in any of the currencies of those countries or in French francs through Foreign Accounts in Francs or Financial Accounts in Francs. s Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. The principal nonresident accounts are Foreign Accounts in Francs, related to the offi- cial exchange market, and Financial Accounts in Francs, related to the financial franc market. BEAC banknotes mailed direct to the BEAC agency in Bangui by the foreign correspondents of authorized banks may be credited freely to Financial Accounts in Francs.

Imports of certain goods, when not originating in a member country of the Central African Customs and Economic Union (UDEAC), may be made only in given ratios to purchases of the local product. The import of firearms is prohibited irrespective of origin. All other imports from countries in the French Franc Area may be made freely and without an import license. All other im- ports from EEC countries also are free from quantitative restrictions. Imports from all countries outside the French Franc Area are subject to licensing within the framework of an annual import program of an indicative character. All import transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank. The import license entitles importers to purchase the necessary exchange, pro- vided that the shipping documents are submitted to the au- thorized bank. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are suspended. All exports of cotton, coffee, corn, tobacco, pea- nuts, palm oil, meat, and diamonds require a license. All other exports to countries in the French Franc Area may be made freely. All exports to countries out ide the French Franc Area require licenses, which are issued freely. The National Marketing Office for Agricultural Products has a monopoly over the export of agricultural products. Proceeds from exports to foreign countrie must be col- lected and repatriated within one month from the due date; the latter generally must fall within 180 days of shipment. Export proceeds received in currencies other than those of France or another Operations Account country must be sur- rendered. All export transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Payments for In visibles Proceeds from Invisibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Mo- naco, and the other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to approval. For many types of payment the approval authority has been delegated to authorized banks. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted freely when the basic transaction has been approved. Resident tourists traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the other Operations Account countries of the French Franc Area may obtain an exchange allocation of an amount equivalent to CFAF 50,000 a year for each person; of this allocation, an amount equiva- lent to CFAF 25,000 may be taken out in foreign banknotes. Any exchange in excess of the equivalent of CFAF 5,000 that remains after return to the Central African Republic must be surrendered. For business travel to foreign countries, there is a special allocation of the equivalent of CFAF 10,000 a person a day, subject to a maximum of CFAF 100,000 a trip, for travel to certain listed countries; the allocation is CFAF 15,000 a day, up to CFAF 150,000 a trip, for business travel to any other foreign country; of this allocation, an amount equivalent to CFAF 5,000 may be taken out in for- eign banknotes. The transfer of the entire net salary of a foreigner working in the Central African Republic is permit- ted upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher, pro- vided that the transfer takes place within three months of the pay period. Travelers going to foreign countries may take out up to a maximum of CFAF 10,000 in BE AC banknotes, French banknotes, and banknotes issued by any other insti- tute of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury. Travelers to other countries may take out any amount in BEAC banknotes. Nonresident travelers may take out foreign currency and other foreign means of payment up to the amount declared by them on entry; they may reconvert up to CFAF 50,000 in BEAC banknotes into foreign currency. 90 Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be collected within a month of the due date and if received in foreign currency, surrendered within a month of the date of receipt. Resident and nonresidents travelers may bring in any amount of banknotes and coins issued by the BEAC, the Bank of France, or any other bank of issue main- taining an Operations Account with the France Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign banknotes and coins (except gold coins) of countries outside the France Franc Area. Capital Capital movements between the Central African Republic and France (as defined above), Monaco, and the other Opera- tions Account countries in the France Franc Area are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries re- quire exchange control approval and are restricted, but capi- tal receipts from such countries are permitted freely. All foreign borrowing by the government or its public and semi- public enterprises, as well as all foreign borrowing with a government guarantee, requires the prior approval of the Di- rector of the Budget within the Ministry of Finance. Special controls (additional to any exchange control re- quirements that may be applicable) are maintained over bor- rowing and lending abroad, over inward and outward direct investment, and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in the Central African Republic; these controls relate to the transactions themselves, not to payments or receipts. With the exception of those over the sale or introduction of foreign securities in the Central Afri- can Republic, the control measures do not apply to relations with France (as defined above), Monaco, and those other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Trea- sury by an Operations Account. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Direct investments abroad 4 require the prior approval of the Ministry of Finance, unless they take the form of a capital increase resulting from reinvestment of undistributed profits; the full or partial liquidation of such investments also re- quires the prior approval of the Ministry of Finance unless the operation involves the relinquishing of a participation that had previously been approved as constituting the making of a direct investment abroad. Foreign direct investments in the Central African Republic 5 must be declared to the Minis- ter of Finance unless they take the form of a capital increase resulting from reinvestment of undistributed profits; the Min- ister has a period of two months from receipt of the declara- tion during which he may request the postponement of the projects submitted to him. The full or partial liquidation of direct investments in the Central African Republic must also be declared to the Minister, unless the operation involves the relinquishing of a participation that had previously been ap- proved as constituting the making of a direct investment in the Central African Republic. Both the making and the liqui- dation of direct investments, whether these are Central Afri- can Republic investments abroad or foreign investments in the Central African Republic, must be reported to the Minis- ter within 20 days following each operation. Direct invest- ments are defined as investments implying control of a company or enterprise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 per cent in the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign se- curities in the Central African Republic requires prior au- thorization by the Minister of Finance. Exempt from authorization, however, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Central African Repub- lic Government and (2) shares similar to securities whose issuing, advertising, or offering for sale in the Central African Republic has previously been authorized. Borrowing abroad by physical or juridical persons, whether public or private persons, whose normal residence or registered office is in the Central African Republic, or by branches or subsidiaries in the Central African Republic of juridical persons whose registered office is abroad, requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans con- stituting a direct investment abroad for which prior approval has been obtained, as indicated above; (2) loans directly con- nected with the rendering of services abroad by the persons or firms mentioned above, or with the financing of commer- cial transactions either between the Central African Republic and countries abroad or between foreign countries, in which these persons or firms take part; (3) loans contracted by registered banks; and (4) loans other than those mentioned above, when the total amount outstanding of these loans does not exceed CFAF 50 million for any one borrower. The con- 4 Including those made through the intermediary of foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in the Central African Republic and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in the Central African Republic. 5 Including those made by companies in the Central African Republic that are directly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in the Central African Republic of foreign companies. CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC tracting of loans referred to under (4) that are free of authori- zation, and each repayment thereon, must be reported to the Office of Foreign Financial Relations within 20 days of the operation, unless the total outstanding amount of all loans contracted abroad by the borrower is CFAF 500,000 or less. Lending abroad by physical or juridical persons, whose normal residence or registered office is in the Central African Republic, or by branches or subsidiaries in the Central Afri- can Republic of juridical persons whose registered office is abroad, requires prior authorization by the Minister of Fi- nance. The following are, however, exempt from this authori- zation: (1) loans granted by registered banks and (2) other loans when the total amount outstanding of these loans does not exceed CFAF 50 million for any one lender. The making of loans that are free of authorization, and each repayment thereon, must be reported to the Office of Foreign Financial Relations within 20 days of the operation except when the amount of the loan granted abroad by the lender is less than CFAF 500,000. Under Law No. 62 /355 of February 19, 1963 (as amended by Ordinance No. 69/47 of September 2, 1969) and UDEAC Decision No. 18/65 of December 14,1965, industrial, tourist, agricultural, and mining enterprises (both foreign and domes- tic) established in the Central African Republic are granted, under certain conditions, reduced duties and taxes on the import of specified equipment; in addition, certain enterprises receive exemption from direct taxes on specified income. The law also provides for three categories of preferential treatment in accordance with which fiscal and other privileges may be accorded to firms investing in new enterprises or in the expansion of existing ones in most sectors of the economy, except the commercial sector. Preferential treatment A applies to enterprises whose activity and market are limited to the territory of the Central African Republic; it is granted for a period of up to 10 years. Preferential treatment B applies to enterprises whose activity and market include the territory of two or more states of the former Equatorial Customs Union. Preferential treatment C, which contains the most favorable provisions, is reserved for enterprises of prime importance to the country's economic development; it provides for stabiliza- tion of their fiscal charges for up to 25 years. Requests for approval for preferential treatment must be submitted to the Minister of Industry, who is the Chairman of the Investment Commission which considers the applica- tion. If a positive decision has been given by the Commission, the proposed authorization is submitted to the Council of Ministers. Preferential treatments A and C are granted by decree issued by the Council of Ministers. Preferential treat- ment B is granted by an Act of the Board of Directors of the former Equatorial Customs Union upon the recommendation of the Council of Ministers. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in the Central African Republic. Imports and ex- ports of gold from or to any other country require a license, which is seldom granted; in practice, imports and exports are made by an authorized purchasing office. Exempt from prior 91 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC authorization are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the Treasury and (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles). Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Certain companies have been officially appointed as Offices for the Purchase, Import, and Export of Gold and Raw Diamonds. Changes during 1973 February 13. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the exchange rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02 was maintained; the effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously CFAF 255.785 = US$1, became CFAF 230.207 = US$1. March 19. With the entry into effect of new margins ar- rangements between the French franc and certain other Euro- pean currencies, and the maintenance of the exchange rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02, the CFA franc began to appreciate in terms of the U.S. dollar. April 2. The Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique Equatoriale et du Cameroun (BCEAEC) was replaced by the Banque des Etats de 1'Afrique Centrale (BEAC). July. The Malagasy Republic and Mauritania ceased to be Operations Account countries. Consequently, the exchange control regulations and transfer commissions applicable to French Franc Area countries ceased to be applicable to these two countries. 92 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CHAD Exchange System No par value for the currency of Chad has been established with the Fund. The unit of currency is the CFA Franc,l which is officially maintained at the rate of CFAF 1 = 0.02 French franc. Exchange transactions in French francs, the intervention currency, between the Banque des Etats de 1'Afrique Cent rale (BEAC) and commercial banks take place at the rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02, free of commission. Exchange transactions relating to foreign countries, i.e., countries other than France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories except the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries of the French Franc Area, take place in a dual exchange market, at rates based on the fixed rate for the French franc and the Paris exchange rate for the foreign currency concerned in either the official exchange market or the financial franc mar- ket. Settlements eligible for the official exchange market are payments and receipts in respect of imports, exports, and most other current transactions, as well as current payments by or in favor of domestic and foreign public authorities and public bodies. All other settlements with foreign countries, as well as transactions in banknotes of foreign countries and banknotes issued by the BEAC, take place through the finan- cial franc market at freely fluctuating rates. The principal current payments and receipts channeled through the finan- cial franc market are those relating to travel expenses, capital earnings, and workers' remittances. Exchange rates for cer- tain European currencies in the official market are based on par values and central rates; the effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar in this market is not confined within any announced margins. With the exception of those relating to gold, Chad's ex- change control measures do not apply to (1) France (as de- fined above) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Opera- tions Account (Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the People's Republic of the Congo, Dahomey, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Togo, and Upper Volta). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries, except Chad itself, are considered foreign countries, and in principle financial relations only with for- eign countries are subject to exchange control. Administration of Control The Office of the Minister of Finance supervises borrowing and lending abroad, the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Chad, and inward and outward direct investment; it also issues import and export authoriza- tions for gold. Exchange control is also administered by the Minister of Finance, who has delegated his approval author- ity in part to the authorized banks. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through autho- rized banks. Import and export licenses are issued by the 1 The CFA franc circulating in Chad is issued by the Banque des Etats de 1'Afrique Centrale (BEAC) and is legal tender also in Cameroon, Central African Republic, People's Republic of the Congo, and Gabon. Foreign Trade Office in the Ministry of Commerce and In- dustry, except those for gold. Prescription of Currency Chad is an Operations Account country of the French Franc Area, since the BEAC maintains an Operations Ac- count with the French Treasury; settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the other Operations Account countries of the French Franc Area are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Trea- sury. Settlements with the U.S.S.R. are made through special accounts established in accordance with a payments agree- ment. Settlements with all other countries are usually made through correspondent banks in France in any of the curren- cies of those countries or in French francs through Foreign or Financial Accounts in Francs. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. BEAC banknotes may be credited freely to Financial Accounts in Francs maintained by the foreign correspondents of authorized banks, provided that the notes are mailed direct to the BEAC agency in Chad by the correspondent banks concerned. Imports and Import Payments Imports from all sources of wheat, wheat flour, and sugar require licenses. All other imports from countries in the French Franc Area and from EEC countries other than France may be made freely. All imports from non-EEC countries outside the French Franc Area are subject to licens- ing in accordance with an annual import program. This pro- gram and the amount of foreign exchange required to implement it are determined by the Minister of Commerce and Industry on the basis of proposals drawn up by the Committee on Imports and discussed by a joint French- Chadian Committee. The import program contains global quotas for imports from non-EEC countries outside the French Franc Area and a special quota for imports of cotton textiles from countries with abnormal competitive advantages. In addition, the pro- gram contains global quotas for imports of wheat, wheat flour, and sugar from EEC countries. Imports from Rhodesia and South Africa are prohibited. Specified imports from neighboring countries not belong- ing to the French Franc Area (the Libyan Arab Republic, Nigeria, and the Sudan) up to a value of CFAF 3 million a year in each direction for a single importer may be made through compensation transactions. All import transactions valued at CFAF 100,000 or more and relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Import licenses entitle importers to pur- chase the necessary exchange, provided that the shipping documents are submitted to the authorized bank. Forward 93 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CHAD cover for imports from foreign countries is only permitted for specified commodities and requires the prior approval of the Office of the Minister of Finance. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Mo- naco, and the other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to approval. For many types of payment the approval authority has been delegated to authorized banks. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted freely when bona fide. For tourist travel, residents traveling to countries other than France, Monaco, and the other Operations Account countries of the French Franc Area may obtain an exchange allocation of an amount equivalent to CFAF 175,000 a person a trip, for any number of trips a year; any foreign exchange remaining after return to Chad must be surrendered. For business travel to foreign countries, there is a special allocation of the equivalent of up to CFAF 400,000 a person a trip; the Office of the Minister of Finance may issue exceptional allocations in excess of CFAF 400,000. Tourist and business travel allocations may not be combined. Travelers going to foreign countries may take out up to a maximum of CFAF 10,000 in BEAC bank- notes. Travelers to other countries may take out any amount in BEAC banknotes. A resident going abroad for less than 24 hours may not take out more than CFAF 5,000 in CFA banknotes. Nonresident travelers may take out foreign banknotes and coins up to the amount declared by them on entry, or, if no declaration has been made, up to the equivalent of CFAF 100,000; they may reconvert into foreign currency BEAC banknotes up to CFAF 25,000 that have been ob- tained from the sale of foreign means of payments that were declared upon entry. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Rhodesia and South Africa are prohibited. All exports to non-EEC countries outside the French Franc Area require licenses. Specified exports to the Libyan Arab Repub- lic, Nigeria, and the Sudan may be made through compensa- tion transactions. Exports of cotton are the monopoly of COTONTCHAD. Export transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value exceeds CFAF 50,000. Export proceeds received in currencies other than those of France or an Operations Account country must be surrendered. Export proceeds normally must be received within 180 days after the arrival of the commodities at their destination. The proceeds must be collected, and surrendered if received in a foreign currency, within two months of the due date. 94 Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be collected, and if received in foreign currency surrendered, within two months of the due date. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of banknotes and coins issued by the BEAC, the Bank of France, or any other bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank- notes and coins (except gold coins) and other foreign means of payment. Capital Capital movements between Chad and France (as defined above), Monaco, and other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require exchange control ap- proval and are restricted, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. All foreign securities, foreign currency, and titles embodying claims on foreign countries or nonresidents that are held in Chad by residents or nonresi- dents must be deposited with authorized banks in Chad. Special controls (additional to any exchange control re- quirements that may be applicable or suspended insofar as they would be contrary to the exchange control regulations) are maintained over borrowing and lending abroad, over in- ward and outward direct investment, and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Chad; these controls relate to the transactions themselves, not to payments or receipts. With the exception of those over the sale or introduction of foreign securities in Chad, the control measures do not apply to relations with France (as defined above), Monaco, and those other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account.

Both the making and the liquidation of direct investments, whether these are Chadian investments abroad or foreign investments in Chad, must be reported to the Minister of Finance within 20 days following each operation. Direct investments are de- fined as investments implying control of a company or enter- prise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 per cent of the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign secu- rities in Chad requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. Exempt from authorization, however, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Chadian Government and (2) shares similar to securities whose issue, advertising, or offering for sale in Chad has previously been authorized. Borrowing abroad by physical or juridical persons, whether public or private persons, whose normal residence or registered office is in Chad, or by branches or subsidiaries in Chad of juridical persons whose registered office is abroad, requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans constituting a direct investment abroad for which prior approval has been obtained, as indicated above; (2) loans directly connected with the rendering of services abroad by the persons or firms mentioned above, or with the financing of commercial transactions either between Chad and countries abroad or between foreign countries, in which these persons or firms take part; (3) loans contracted by registered banks; and (4) loans other than those mentioned above, when the total amount outstanding of these loans does not exceed CFAF 50 million for any one borrower. The contracting of loans referred to under (4) that are free of authorization, and each repayment thereon, must be declared to the Minister of Finance within 20 days of the operation, unless the total outstanding amount of all loans contracted abroad by the borrower is CFAF 5 million or less. Lending abroad by physical or juridical persons, whether public or private persons, whose normal residence or regis- tered office is in Chad, or by branches or subsidiaries in Chad of juridical persons whose registered office is abroad, requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans granted by registered banks; and (2) other loans, when the total amount outstanding of these loans does not exceed CFAF 50 million for any one lender. The making of loans that are free of authorization, and each repayment thereon, must be declared to the Minister of Finance within 20 days of the operation, unless the amount of the loan is less than CFAF 500,000, provided, however, that the total outstanding amount of all loans granted abroad by the lender does not exceed CFAF 5 million. Commercial banks must maintain in Chad a specified minimum proportion of their assets. Under the Investment Code of August 26, 1963, any enter- CHAD prise established in Chad, whether domestic or foreign, is granted, under certain conditions, reduced duties and taxes on specified imports, as well as exemption from direct taxes on specified income. The Code also provides for three catego- ries of preferential treatment, in accordance with which cer- tain fiscal and other privileges may be accorded to firms- investing in specified new industries or in the expansion of existing ones. Requests for preferential treatment must be submitted to the Minister of Commerce and Industry, who, after examining the documents, transmits them to the Invest- ment Commission. After an opinion has been given by that Commission, the project is submitted to the Council of Min- isters. Gold Chad has issued five gold coins of CFAF 1,000, 3,000, 5,000, 10,000, and 20,000 which are legal tender. Ordinance No. 3 /PR /TP of February 10, 1968 concerning nonmonetary gold (ratified by Law No. 23 of June 4, 1968), in conjunction with relevant exchange control regulations, governs the hold- ing, sale, import, circulation, export, and processing of gold and diamonds. Residents who are not producers of gold may not hold unworked gold unless thay have obtained an autho- rization issued by the President acting on the advice of the Minister of Mines. Imports and exports of gold, whether unworked or refined, require prior authorization by the Office of the Minister of Finance and by the Directorate of Mines and Geology as well as the visa of the Foreign Trade Office in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and (2) imports and exports of man- ufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles). Exports of unworked gold and of raw diamonds (as well as domestic purchases and sales of both) are the monopoly of an approved Office for Purchases, Sales, Imports, and Exports (BAVIE), which is a private company. Unworked gold may be exported only to France. Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Changes during 1973 February 13.

Not for Redistribution CHILE Exchange Rate System No par value for the Chilean Escudo (which was intro- duced on January 1, 1960) has been established with the Fund. The par value for the Chilean peso established with the Fund on October 5, 1953 is not applied to any transactions under the present exchange system. There are two exchange markets: the official market (known as the banking market) and the brokers' market. Only the Central Bank, the Banco del Estado, authorized commercial banks, and other persons or entities authorized by the Central Bank may operate in these markets; at present, brokers are not permitted to operate in either market. There are multiple exchange rates in both markets and outward transfers through both markets are controlled. The rates of exchange in both markets are set by the Central Bank and they are adjusted periodically. Through the banking market pass government transactions, all trade and trade-related transactions, all capital transactions, and most invisible transactions other than travel. There is a separate exchange rate in this market for the proceeds from copper exports. Only travel expenditures and a few residual transactions in invisi- bles are conducted through the brokers' market. Transactions in the banking market are for both spot and forward delivery at the same exchange rate; forward exchange purchases are mandatory for imports of most commodities and export pro- ceeds (other than those from copper, nitrate, and iron) may be sold forward. For both types of transaction, settlement in escudos is effected at the time the foreign exchange contract is negotiated. Transactions in the brokers' market are for spot delivery only. There is some restriction on the availability of foreign exchange in that the Central Bank sells exchange to the commercial banks only for forward delivery (180 days from the date of settlement in escudos by the importer). On December 31,1973 the main exchange rate in the bank- ing market was E° 360 per US$1 and the rate for copper export proceeds was E ° 130 per US$1. In the brokers' market, the basic exchange rate was E ° 750 per US$1; the application on the selling side of two exchange taxes totaling 53.15 per cent resulted in an effective selling exchange rate of about E° 1,150 per US$1. In both markets, commissions were per- mitted only on sales of exchange, and these could not ex- ceed YJO of 1 per cent. Most transfers of profits and dividends are settled in the banking market, subject to an exchange tax of 18.5 per cent. Administration of Control The Foreign Trade Department and the Department of International Transactions of the Central Bank of Chile are in charge of the operation of the exchange control system. Some functions of the Foreign Trade Department have been delegated to local commissions in important cities, and the supervision of copper exports, all imports of the copper in- dustry, and some imports of the nitrate and iodine industry has been delegated to the Copper Corporation (CODELCO), which is supervised by the Central Bank and the Superinten- dency of Banks. Imports for the public sector are supervised 96 by the interministerial Import Committee for the Public Sec- tor, on which the Central Bank is also represented. Prescription of Currency Settlements with Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela must be made through accounts maintained with each other by the Central Bank of Chile and the central bank of the country concerned, within the framework of the LAFTA multilateral clearing system. For imports, payment in U.S. dollars is per- mitted for goods of any origin and is mandatory for imports from the United States and imports from Latin American countries with which reciprocal credit agreements are in force; payment in sterling is permitted for imports of any origin other than the United States and countries with recip- rocal credit agreements; payment in renminbi through the clearing account is mandatory for goods originating in the People's Republic of China; Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs may be used to pay for imports from the country issuing the currency concerned. Export proceeds must be received in U.S. dollars when stemming from sales to Latin American countries with which reciprocal credit agreements are maintained, and renminbi must be received for exports to the People's Republic of China. Proceeds from exports to other countries may be re- ceived in any of the following currencies: Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Ital- ian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kro- ner, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, or Swiss francs, but the use of each of these currencies is manda- tory for exports to the country issuing the currency con- cerned. All settlements with Poland and certain settlements with Bulgaria are made through special accounts established under bilateral payments agreements. Certain payments and transfers to South Africa are prohibited. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Rhodesia and imports of military equip- ment from South Africa are prohibited. There is a List of Permitted Imports; commodities not appearing on it are pro- hibited unless imported through a "free port" zone (see be- low) or unless they are on Chile's National List negotiated with LAFTA or are imported from Andean Pact countries. A wide range of commodities may be considered as effectively prohibited for private importation since, although on the List of Permitted Imports, they are subject to an advance deposit requirement of 10,000 per cent unless they are imported by public sector agencies, originate in Andean Pact countries, are imported under a special regime, or are on the National List and originate in a LAFTA country; the Executive Com- mittee of the Central Bank, however, may grant specific ex- ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution emptions. Goods may be normally imported in any amount. The Central Bank, however, is empowered to reject import applications (registrations) and during most of 1973 this au- thority was used in lieu of an import licensing system. Imports on deferred payment terms (cobertura diferidd) require prior authorization of the credit terms by the Central Bank. Imports of goods not on the permitted list that are imported into "free port" zones such as Arica, Magallanes, Aysen, and Chiloe, may not be shipped to other parts of the country unless they are first processed or assembled in the tree port" zone. Certain commodities (including automobiles and most trucks) may only be imported into a "free port" zone for use in that zone. Importers may purchase forward exchange as soon as their import applications have been ap- proved. Settlement in escudos is effected at the time the for- ward exchange contract is negotiated. Foreign exchange for payments of approved imports is sold by the Central Bank for delivery 180 days from the date of the escudo payment. Im- ports are subject to a registration tax of 3 per cent of the c.i.f. value. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles are subject to exchange control. Most are settled in the banking market, while travel and certain residual invisible transactions are settled in the bro- kers' market. Payments through this market may be effected up to established limits for a number of purposes: for tourist travel (in addition to fares; all limits are a person a journey, with a 30-day waiting period between trips, and subject to an annual limit of US$300 for all travel exchange taken up by any one person; all allocations are subject to a tax at a rate of 53.15 per cent) the equivalent of US$30 for travel to desti- nations within 500 kilometers of the Chilean border (defined to include all of Argentina except the cities of Buenos Aires, Bahia Blanca, and Comodoro Rivadavia), subject to a maxi- mum of US$5 a day; the equivalent of US$105 for travel to other parts of Latin America (defined to include the Baha- mas, Curacao, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico), with a maximum of US$15 a day; the equivalent of US$200 for travel to Can- ada and the United States, with a maximum of US$20 a day; the equivalent of US$300 to countries outside the Western Hemisphere, with a maximum of US$20 a day; for purchases of books and periodicals US$100 a person a year. At the end of 1973 the allocation for family remittances was suspended. Banks may sell up to US$1,200 a person a year for payment of insurance premiums contracted prior to November 20, 1970 in foreign currency with national insurance companies or with foreign companies authorized to operate in Chile. Transfers of other insurance premiums require the approval of the Central Bank, which acts on the advice of the Superin- tendent of Insurance. Payments for medicines and pharma- ceutical products may only be made provided that the product in question is not available in Chile. A number of transactions conducted in the banking market are also sub- ject to established limits: student registration fees, US$50 a person a year; students abroad on scholarship, US$95 to US$400 a person a month; other students abroad, US$125 to US$175 a person a month. Transfers in excess of the limits CHILE and those in respect of transactions for which no basic alloca- tion has been announced require the prior authorization of the Central Bank. All purchases of exchange in the brokers' market are sub- ject to a tax of 53.15 per cent, except those for which the Central Bank has approved a transfer application (solicited de giro), which are subject only to a 0.15 per cent basic exchange tax; the only documentation required for invisibles that are neither covered by the approval authority delegated to autho- rized commercial banks nor by a solicitud de giro is an appli- cation form (carta petition) addressed to the Central Bank through an authorized bank. Residents of Chilean nationality and residents of foreign nationality who have spent more than a year in Chile, when traveling to countries outside Latin America, are required to pay a travel tax of E° 3,550 a trip. Exports and Export Proceeds With minor exceptions for humanitarian reasons, exports to Rhodesia are prohibited. Exports of arms and related equipment to South Africa also are prohibited. Additionally, exports of some items are prohibited or are subject to quota irrespective of destination. All exports must be registered with the Foreign Trade Department of the Central Bank and the sale proceeds of exports are subject to surrender requirements. Exporters, when submitting an export registration to the Central Bank, are required to furnish at the same time a power of attorney entrusting the Central Bank or any authorized commercial bank with the collection of export proceeds.1 Commercial banks are authorized to purchase on a spot or a forward basis foreign exchange proceeds from exporters. In the case of forward purchases, the forward period cannot be under 10 days nor over 180 days. Receipts from copper exports are sold direct to the Central Bank on a spot basis. Most export proceeds subject to surrender requirements must be repatriated within 90 days from the date of shipment, and surrendered within 10 days thereafter, but for specified goods this period is extended to between 120 days and 480 days. Export proceeds sold on a spot basis must be trans- ferred to the Central Bank. By virtue of Law No. 16528 of 1966, many minor exports receive refunds of taxes and other charges included in their cost of production. Proceeds from Invisibles All foreign exchange proceeds from invisibles must be sur- rendered. Proceeds from productive services rendered by resi- dents, from most insurance transactions by national insurance companies or by foreign insurance companies au- thorized to operate in Chile, and from certain commercial services (news agency fees, royalties, copyrights, etc.) must be sold in the banking market. Exchange received from commu- nications agencies1 fees, nontrade-related transport services, tourism expenditure, fo/reign student remittances, and a few other invisible transactions must be sold in the bro- kers' market. 1 This requirement was abolished on January 7, 1974. 97 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CHILE Capital Capital inflows are free, but most outflows are restricted. All capital transactions and remittances of dividends, profits, and interest are settled in the banking market. Chile has ratified the Andean Group's Cartagena Agreement and in principle limits transfers of profits, dividends, and interest on foreign capital to 14 per cent per annum. All new foreign borrowing or refinancing of existing credits by commercial banks requires prior approval by the Central Bank. Foreign capital may enter Chile under one of three different arrange- ments depending on the purpose and type of the investment. (1) Article 14 of Decree No. 1272 of September 7, 1961 stipulates that capital brought into the country in the form of foreign exchange (aporte de capital) may be sold freely through authorized banks when the investor (individual or corporation, national or foreign) has registered with the Cen- tral Bank. Such capital may only be repatriated with the prior approval of the Central Bank. The same is true for the trans- fer of interest and profits on such capital. Repatriation is only allowed in accordance with the amortization schedule estab- lished at the time of registration. (2) According to Article 16 of the above Decree, the inves- tor may enter into a loan agreement with a Chilean individual or corporation, or into an agreement with a national enter- prise with a view to capital participation. The Central Bank guarantees access to the banking market, both for the servic- ing of loans and the re-export of capital, and for the remit- tance of interest and profits. The guarantee is given subject to certain conditions, one of which is a minimum investment period of three years. As an application and extension of Article 16, the Executive Committee of the Central Bank on November 3, 1963 took a decision to create an additional regime to further foreign investment in Chilean export indus- tries. Under this regime, capital may be brought in for the promotion of exports of agricultural, industrial, and mining products and it may be repatriated, provided that the amount repatriated is financed from the increase in the volume of exports resulting from the investment. The regime is imple- mented through individual investment agreements in accor- dance with Article 16. Repatriation of the invested capital may start two years after entry and may amount to 12V2 per cent annually of the invested capital. In addition, the remit- tance of interest or profits is permitted annually up to 7 per cent of the invested capital. The above privileges are granted only to firms that will not purchase foreign exchange in the banking market to acquire abroad any machinery, equip- ment, or capital goods on a cash payment basis. In a further extension of the regime under Article 16, on June 2, 1966, the Central Bank announced that it would guarantee the foreign exchange for repatriation of, and earn- ings on, imported capital, provided that certain conditions were met. These were (a) the investment must be deemed to be of importance to the Chilean economy; (b) it must amount to at least US$100,000 or the equivalent in other currencies; (c) the capital must remain in the country for at least three years, and subsequent repatriation must not be more than 20 per cent a year, on a noncumulative basis; (d) the exchange must be sold in the banking market; and (e) the interest rate 98 on credit to Chilean firms must not be higher than that in the domestic market. (3) The most important law governing foreign investment is Decree-Law No. 258 of 1960, which establishes a regime both for foreign exchange transfers and long-term capital investment. A Foreign Investment Committee studies the proposal and the Ministry of Economy approves by decree the particular investment; the Committee establishes both guarantees regarding withdrawal of capital and remittances of interest and profits and may also give special guarantees regarding exemption from payment of certain import sur- charges, customs duties, and taxes. Such privileges may be granted for a period of 10 years, with extension to 20 years in special cases. Remittances are effected in the same market (normally the banking market) through which the capital was brought in, and the investor has the right to use the exchange resulting from the export proceeds of his investment. Decision No. 24 of the Cartagena Agreement is considered to override any contrary provisions of Decree-Law No. 258 and of Articles 14 and 16 of Decree No. 1272. Gold Chile has issued four gold coins, which are legal tender. Newly mined gold is purchased from the producers by Em- presa National de Mineria (ENAMI), which, after refining, sells it to the Central Bank. The latter has this gold coined at the Mint. The Central Bank makes gold available to dental users at E° 2,605.75 a gram of fine gold (in the form of Chilean gold coins) and to industrial users at E° 3,195.73 a gram (in the form of mint blanks). The Central Bank has exclusive power to purchase, sell, negotiate, or transfer gold in any form for any purpose, except in the form of jewelry. All import and export of gold contained in minerals is subject to special authorization by the Central Bank. Gold bars are imported and exported only by the Central Bank. The import of gold coins and of gold dust, gold leaf, and gold wire for industrial use is subject to a 10,000 per cent advance deposit requirement; the import of gold coins is not normally permit- ted.

CHILE 103 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPUBLIC OF CHINA Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.0204628 gram of fine gold per New Taiwan Dollar. The Republic of China has established a cen- tral rate of NT$1 = SDR 0.0218144, corresponding to 0.0193858 gram of fine gold per new Taiwan dollar or NT$38 = US$1, and avails itself of wider margins. The official buy- ing and selling rates for the U.S. dollar are NT$37.90 and NT$38.10, respectively. Buying and selling rates for certain other currencies are also officially posted, with daily quota- tions based on the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar in markets abroad. 1 Currencies for which rates are not offi- cially posted may be accepted by appointed banks, and the rates are calculated in accordance with the foreign market quotations. 2 With certain exceptions, earners of foreign ex- change must sell it to banks appointed by the Central Bank of China. There is no exchange market. The appointed banks clear their exchange transactions at the end of each day with the Central Bank. Forward cover facilities are limited to im- port and export transactions and to the officially posted cur- rencies, with the exception of the U.S. dollar. Administration of Control The Executive Yuan is responsible for policies concerning foreign exchange and trade controls. Foreign exchange and trade matters are entrusted to the Ministries of Finance and Economic Affairs and the Central Bank of China. The Minis- try of Finance has general jurisdiction over foreign exchange laws and regulations, and is in charge of government remit- tances. The Foreign Exchange Department of the Central Bank of China is responsible for the overall management of foreign exchange, for the determination of the official buying and selling rates of exchange, and for the supervision of the authorized banks ("appointed banks**)* of which the Bank of Taiwan is the most important. The Central Bank also licenses private remittances and capital movements. The Board of Foreign Trade of the Ministry of Economic Affairs coordi- nates industrial and trade policies, including those relating to the import regime and export promotion, and is in charge of the issuance of import and export licenses. By delegation, the Application Receipt and Dispatch Center at the Board of Foreign Trade screens applications for import licenses and issues the licenses; for some goods, however, import applica- tions and licenses are screened and issued by 15 appointed banks and their branches. Export applications are screened, and export permits issued, by 25 appointed banks. Most foreign exchange transactions are conducted through ap- pointed banks. Prescription of Currency Export receipts must be obtained in Australian dollars, deutsche mark, Hong Kong dollars, pounds sterling, Singa- 1 Australian dollars, deutsche mark, Hong Kong dollars, pounds sterling, Singapore dollars, and Swiss francs. * A conversion rate Y 7.5 = NT$1 exists for Japanese banknotes. 104 pore dollars, Swiss francs, or U.S. dollars. 3 Currencies not officially posted may be accepted by appointed banks but must be converted into posted currencies in exchange markets abroad. The Central Bank supplies foreign exchange in the form of any of the posted currencies for making payments to residents of foreign countries. Nonresident Accounts The Republic of China's exchange control regulations do not provide for a clear distinction between residents and non- residents. As a consequence, persons who would be consid- ered nonresident under many other exchange control systems are not granted treatment essentially different from that ac- corded to residents of the Republic of China in exchange control matters. Accounts in new Taiwan dollars of persons who are resi- dents of other countries are treated in the same way and are subject to the same regulations as other accounts in new Taiwan dollars. The exchange control regulations do not pro- vide for blocked balances and blocked accounts held in the name of residents of foreign countries. Residents may maintain accounts in U.S. dollars, pounds sterling, or Hong Kong dollars, as follows: Holders of foreign banknotes or travelers checks may have these credited to Foreign Currency Accounts, and recipients of remittances from abroad or of money orders or other negotiable instru- ments drawn on foreign banks may have the proceeds cred- ited to Foreign Exchange Accounts. Balances in Foreign Currency Accounts may be withdrawn in the original cur- rency or in new Taiwan dollars, after conversion at the official buying rate. Balances in Foreign Exchange Accounts may be withdrawn in new Taiwan dollars; they may also be remitted abroad freely, with the exception that foreign exchange that originated in the United States may not be remitted to Hong Kong. Foreign Exchange Accounts and Foreign Currency Accounts are subdivided into interest-bearing time deposits and passbook accounts (which do not bear interest). Imports and Import Payments4 Most imports require individual licenses. For virtually all commodities subject to license, license applications are screened, and import licenses are issued, by the Application Receipt and Dispatch Center at the Board of Foreign Trade. Designated appointed banks have authority to screen import applications for certain daily necessities, to issue import li- censes on behalf of the Central Bank, and to make the neces- sary foreign exchange available; these goods are automatically approved for an import license. Importers of goods on the permissible list (see below) may contract on documents against payment (D/P), documents against acceptance (D/A), or usance letter of credit terms (provided that the credit term is less than one year); imports of machinery and equipment, however, must be made on a 3 However, certain exports to Viet-Nam are settled under tied letters of credit in U.S. dollars which may be used only to finance imports from the United States other than surplus agricultural commodities. 4 Special regulations apply to imports into the export processing zones; the main one is at Kaohsiung. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution cash settlement basis when the value of the import is less than US$3 million and the terms of repayment are under five years. The holder of an import license is entitled to obtain the necessary foreign exchange from an appointed bank. Ex- change settlement corresponding to 25 per cent of the f.o.b., c. & f., or c.i.f. value of imports must be made within 28 days of approval of the license for all imports not taking place on adeferred payment, consignment, D /P, or D /A basis, i.e., for all imports under sight letter of credit; the requirement is 15 per cent for usance letters of credit; 15 per cent for letters of credit financed by self-provided exchange; 20 per cent for letters of credit on an installment payment basis; and 10 per cent for letters of credit covering bulk imports specially ap- proved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. This advance settlement requirement, the so-called performance deposit, is a condition for the issuance of a letter of credit. Imports from communist countries are prohibited in prin- ciple, although imports of bulk goods, industrial raw materi- als, and many consumer goods from any source other than mainland China are now being licensed. The authorities li- cense and check imports from Hong Kong in order to induce importers to obtain certain imports direct from the country of production and to control effectively imports from main- land China; for similar reasons, certain commodities are not permitted to be imported from Hong Kong, Japan, Macao, Malaysia, and Singapore. Certain commodities financed with U.S. aid funds (including tied letter of credit funds) can be imported only from the United States. Applications for im- ports from Japan of machinery valued over US$200,000 for each individual order require the approval of the Board of Foreign Trade. Imports are divided into three groups: (1) prohibited, (2) controlled, and (3) permissible. The prohibited imports com- prise not only narcotics and some other goods excluded by most countries from importation but also a wide range of Pharmaceuticals. The controlled list contains, in addition to such items as arms and ammunition, ships, and poisonous chemicals, a number of luxury goods and less essential items (such as certain Chinese luxury foods, cigarettes, cigars, li- quor, certain medicines, tea, sugar and its substitutes, molas- ses, made-up clothing, consumer durables, antiques, certain jewelry, gold, and silver) and goods subject to domestic regu- lation and allocation. The first type of goods are licensed restrictively; 5 goods of the second type are often imported by government agencies, which offer them for sale either by allocation or by auction. Liquor and cigarettes are imported by a government monopoly organization, which is also re- sponsible for domestic distribution of these commodities. Goods on the permissible list are licensed liberally and can be imported by both end-users and traders. The importation of items on the controlled list is permitted only to factories and end-users. For certain goods, preference must be given to domestic over imported goods, provided that the price of the local product does not exceed that of the import by more than * Licenses for goods on the controlled list are liberally granted when the goods concerned are for equipping new facilities, e.g., hotels for the tourist trade. REPUBLIC OF CHINA 5 per cent. On December 31, 1973, of 15,261 classified import items, 13 were prohibited, 461 were controlled, and 14,787 were permissible. A general (covering) licensing procedure has been intro- duced in respect of a few items on the controlled list. Under this procedure, manufacturers and other direct end-users are granted authorization semiannually for the importation of listed items specified by value and by quantity. Exchange for such imports is obtainable automatically each time the im- porter presents the general approved license at an appointed bank. Furthermore, an automatic approval system is applied to certain items on the permissible list. Under this system, importers may obtain foreign exchange at any appointed bank by submitting import licenses which are automatically approved. On December 31, 1972, the system applied to 3,955 items, and on December 31, 1973 to 10,271 items. Special regulations apply to 6 commodities normally im- ported in bulk shipments. 6 They are subject to annual quotas and priority must be given to Chinese flag vessels for their importation. According to the intended utilization, goods may be im- ported by one of the three main groups of importers: govern- ment trading agencies, qualified private traders, and end-users and manufacturers. The import of crude oil is con- fined to the Chinese Petroleum Corporation. The Central Trust of China is the main government trading agency. It handles imports for government and military organizations, public enterprises, and other customers. Another government trading agency is the Taiwan Supply Bureau, which is in charge of imports for the Taiwan Provincial Government, some local industries, and certain other customers. Firms that wish to operate as authorized ("registered") importers must obtain approval ("registration") from the Board of Foreign Trade; the firms must be operating in accor- dance with certain laws and have a minimum capital of NT$500,000 and an "export record" equivalent to more than US$100,000 for the last year. Traders licensed to operate on a commission basis may act only as agents for foreign suppli- ers. They also must be registered by the Board of Foreign Trade. End-users and manufacturers are permitted to import raw materials, machinery, and replacement equipment needed for their factories. In granting licenses to this category of im- porter, the licensing authorities take into account such crite- ria as production capacity and equipment. In processing applications for licenses to import capital equipment for the construction of new plants, the licensing authorities consider the feasibility of the project and its priority from the point of view of the economic needs of the country. When the capital goods concerned are available from domestic sources, import licenses usually are not issued. Imports to be used for process- ing or producing goods for export are licensed up to require- ments (e.g., raw cotton, wool, and wood for the production of plywood). According to the methods of financing, imports may be divided into two broad categories: (1) imports for which ex- change is allocated directly out of official exchange reserves, 6 Soybeans, wheat, barley, corn, sorghum, and rapeseed. 105 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPUBLIC OF CHINA and (2) imports which are made without recourse to official exchange reserves and which comprise (a) those made under the U.S. P.L. 480 program and (b) those paid for with self-provided exchange or exchange supplied by foreign inves- tors, foreign lenders, or overseas Chinese. Imports obtained with self-provided exchange are those financed by importers out of their own foreign exchange obtained by them prior to their coming to the Republic of China or originating from exchange receipts exempt from the surrender requirement. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require approval from the Cen- tral Bank of China. Payments for invisibles directly related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved. The transfer of interest, profits, and earn- ings on authorized foreign investments in the Republic of China may be made without restriction. Residents may at any time (but not more often than four times a year) make out- ward transfers up to the equivalent of US$200 for any pur- pose other than import payments; applications for such personal remittances are approved automatically. Foreign exchange for payments for certain other invisibles is allocated only up to established limits or on a percentage basis. Foreign technicians are allowed to remit to their depen- dents abroad up to 70 per cent of their monthly salary. Em- ployees of the Government or of educational institutions may remit to their dependents in Hong Kong or Macao up to HKS150 a month. Membership fees of foreign institutions and certain payments for news services, books, and maga- zines (personal subscriptions for reference purposes) are also approved. Receipts from local subscriptions to, and sales of, imported newspapers and periodicals are remittable. Up to 70 per cent of the net amount of motion-picture film rental and of foreign entertainers* earnings may be transferred abroad; the remainder is to be used for local expenses. The full amount of tuition and living expenses during the first aca- demic year of students studying abroad may be remitted, and up to US$3,600 a year in the second to f i f th academic years. Residents are granted an exchange allowance equivalent to US$1,000 a trip (US$500 for each accompanying dependent under the age of 12) for any approved type of travel; visas for tourist travel, however, are not normally granted to Chinese nationals. For business travel, an allowance equivalent to US$ 1,200 a month for up to three months is granted for living expenses. All travel allocations are net of fares and tickets. Applications for exchange to pay for certain other types of invisibles are approved on their merits. Residents leaving the Republic of China may take with them no more than NT$ 1,000 in domestic banknotes and coins and the equivalent of US$400 in foreign currencies. Nonresident travelers who have stayed in the Republic less than six months may take with them any unspent portion of the foreign currency which they registered upon entry, and may in addition convert local currency into foreign currency upon submission of the foreign exchange memorandum evi- dencing their acquisition of local currency by sale of ex- change. 106 Exports and Export Proceeds 7 All exports require licenses, mainly in order to ensure the surrender of foreign exchange. Licenses may be issued only for exports to noncommunist countries. The re-exportation of imported goods is permitted after they have been processed. Exports of sugar, rice, and salt are handled by government trading agencies. Quota limitations are maintained on the export of bananas, canned mushrooms, and asparagus. The export of other food- stuffs, fertilizers, paper and pulp, logs, PVC products, ce- ment, steel, and scrap of iron and steel, is either prohibited or suspended. There are ceilings on the export of textiles to Canada, the United States, and the member countries of the EEC. Manufacturers who use imported raw materials to produce goods for export are, after export of the processed goods, refunded various charges imposed on such raw materials. These charges include import duties, harbor dues, and com- modity tax. Some preferential treatment is accorded to payers of income tax related to the production of goods for export, provided that the taxpayers submit satisfactory proof of such exports; complete exemption from the tax is not granted, however. With minor exceptions, exporters are required to surrender exchange earnings accruing from exports immediately after their collection. Most exports to any permitted destination may be made on a consignment or collection basis, provided that payment is not deferred for more than 180 days from shipment. Subject to approval, bona fide gifts and commodity samples up to the value of US$200 may be sent abroad. When leaving the Republic of China, tourists are allowed to take out domestic products valued up to US$200 without providing evidence that they have surrendered foreign exchange. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange surrender requirements applicable to proceeds from invisibles are generally similar to those applicable to export proceeds. Interest, earnings, and profits on invest- ments made by Chinese investors outside the country, and originally approved by the Central Bank of China, must be surrendered to the banks, but earnings from private invest- ments abroad that have not been financed by outward remit- tances may be retained. Private inward remittances may be retained by the recipients for deposit on a foreign exchange account, from which they may be transferred freely. Travelers may bring in any amount of foreign currency and either hold or surrender it; the amount imported must be declared upon entry. The import of domestic banknotes ex- pressed in new Taiwan dollars is limited to NT$ 1,000 for each traveler; a license from the Ministry of Finance is required for importing a larger amount. Capital Investments by nonresidents (including overseas Chinese) may be made in capital equipment or raw materials, or 7 Special regulations apply to exports and re-exports from the export processing zones. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution through the transfer of foreign currency to the Republic of China. In accordance with the Foreign Investment Law of July 14, 1954, as amended in 1959, and the 1971 Statute for Encouragement of Investment, new foreign investments ap- proved by the authorities are guaranteed (1) unrestricted transfer of net annual profits or earned interest; (2) repatria- tion of capital, including reinvested earnings, 2 years after completion of the investment plan, at an annual rate not exceeding 15 per cent, calculated in relation to the invested funds; (3) the right to re-export invested capital in its original form; (4) favorable treatment in respect of rezoning and req- uisition of agricultural land for industrial use; (5) certain benefits with respect to business income tax and import duties; and (6) compensation for expropriation where the foreign investment constitutes less than 51 per cent, and im- munity from expropriation for 20 years where the foreign investment constitutes at least 51 per cent, of the total invest- ment. In addition, foreign investments are granted treatment at least as favorable as that accorded to new domestic invest- ments. Laws for the encouragement of foreign investments provide for additional benefits in specific cases. To obtain the benefits of the investment laws, investments by nonresidents must be made in enterprises conducive to the economic and social development of the country, such as mining, communications, and manufacturing for domestic needs. Preference is given to foreign investors who intend to produce goods for export or for replacing imports. Nonresidents (including overseas Chinese) who intend to make investments in Taiwan stocks and wish to take advan- tage of privileges provided under the foreign investment laws, as described above, must obtain approval from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Purchases and sales of stocks and bonds by nonresidents must be made through the intermediary of registered brokers, such as the Trust Department of the Bank of Taiwan and the Trust Department of the Central Trust of China. Subject to approval, direct investments may be made out- side the Republic of China in the form of technical know-how, semifinished products, locally manufactured equipment, and remittances of foreign exchange. Applica- tions that receive sympathetic treatment include those which would assist in assuring a stable supply of raw materials for domestic industries. Portfolio investment abroad by residents who are private persons is not normally permitted. Chinese nationals who wish to emigrate, and foreign per- sons who have settled in the Republic of China and wish to return to their native countries, are not accorded any transfer facilities in respect of proceeds from the liquidation of their assets in the Republic. Persons outside the Republic of China who acquired in the Republic assets or balances in new Tai- wan dollars on account of dowries, inheritances, gifts, and so forth, are not normally granted the right of transferring them from the Republic. Certain inflows of short-term capital are restricted. These include foreign currency loans for working capital purposes and certain forms of import credit. Domestic banks are per- mitted to hold short-term deposits with their foreign corre- spondents but they are not normally permitted to acquire REPUBLIC OF CHINA foreign treasury bills, certificates of deposit, or other types of foreign securities. Gold Producers of gold must sell their output to ornamental gold processors (registered goldsmiths, silversmiths, and jew- elers), through open tenders conducted by the Central Trust of China; gold delivered to the Central Trust for refining must have a fineness of 0.945, any necessary reduction being under- taken by the Taiwan Metal Mining Corporation. Any newly produced gold that remains unsold at auction must be kept in the custody of institutions specifically designated by the Government; at present, only the Central Trust is so desig- nated. Ornamental gold processors are not permitted to sell gold of a fineness in excess of 0.945. Other residents may hold gold in any form and of any fineness, but its use as collateral for loans is prohibited. Trav- elers may bring in any amount of gold, which must be de- clared upon entry if its weight exceeds 5 shih Hang, i.e., 156.25 grams; other imports of gold are not permitted. Residents may freely take out gold in the form of jewelry, provided that its weight does not exceed 2 shih Hang, i.e., 62.5 grams. Otherwise, exports of gold and gold jewelry by travelers are not normally permitted. Changes during 1973 January 1. A number of luxury goods and less essential items were shifted from the prohibited import list to the controlled list. They included certain Chinese luxury foods, cigarettes, cigars, liquor, certain jewelry, certain medicines, tea, sugar, and molasses. January 1. The tenth edition of the classification of import and export commodities came into effect. It covered 15,261 import items. Of these, 14 items were prohibited, 2,864 were controlled, and 12,383 were permissible. These numbers took into account the shifts from the prohibited to the controlled list that are indicated in the first entry for January 1, above. January 15. The Central Bank ceased to approve new bor- rowing abroad in the form of short-term foreign currency loans for working capital purposes. January 15. Foreign exchange settlement arrangements with banks were changed to provide for the simultaneous payment of domestic currency upon the surrender of export proceeds and other foreign exchange earnings to the Central Bank. Previously, the Central Bank provided domestic cur- rency up to 15 days in advance of the surrender. January 22. For letters of credit opened by appointed banks under foreign currency loans for imports, importers were required to settle in advance not less than 10 per cent of the total amount of the letter of credit. January 23. Exports of wheat flour were suspended for one year, and exports of steel were suspended indefinitely. January 24. It was announced that the Central Bank would extend US$400 million in foreign exchange loans for the im- port of daily necessities and of industrial raw materials and capital equipment. Of this amount, one half would be loaned by various banks at 7% per cent per annum for the importa- tion of machinery. The remaining US$200 million would be 107 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution REPUBLIC OF CHINA loaned through banks to traders and manufacturers for im- ports of necessities and raw materials, also at 7V2 per cent per annum. In addition, to curb rising prices of certain imported products, direct financing would be available at 5% per cent per annum through the Board of Foreign Trade. February 1. Foreign banks in China were permitted to accept local currency demand deposits, but not time or sav- ings deposits. Each bank's local currency deposits could not exceed 12% per cent of capital, and there was an overall ceiling on the deposits of all foreign banks combined. February 16. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the Republic of China established a central rate of NT$1 = SDR 0.0218144, corresponding to NTS45.8413 = SDR 1 or NT$38 = US$1, and continued to avail itself of wider margins. The official buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar, previously NT$40.00 and NT$40.10, were set at NTS37.90 and NT$38.10, respectively, per US$1. February 17. The conversion rate for Japanese banknotes was changed from Y 8.5 = NT$1 to Y 7.5 = NT$1. February 25.

On August 24, these reductions were extended for six months. March 7. The value of bona fide gifts and commodity sam- ples which may be sent abroad, subject to approval, was increased from US$100 to US$200. Tourists leaving the Re- public of China were allowed to take out domestic products valued at up to US$200, compared with US$100 previously, without providing evidence that they had surrendered foreign exchange. March 15. The Board of Foreign Trade began to make foreign currency loans available to importers through the Central Bank. The total amount was initially set at US$200 million. From July 1, unlimited foreign currency loans were made available for imports of wheat, soybeans, corn, and iron and steel. March 16. Over 2,000 items were shifted from the list of controlled imports to the permissible list, and 1 item from the prohibited list to the controlled list. As a result, 13 import items were prohibited, 461 were controlled, and 14,787 were permissible. Most of the shifted items henceforth could be imported from all sources except mainland China. March 16. The requirement was withdrawn that in certain manufacturing industries a stipulated minimum ratio of the value of manufactured products must be met by the use of domestic resources. However, the use of local materials con- tinued to be required for certain domestic industries. April 1. Approval was no longer given for the renewal of maturing short-term foreign currency loans for working capi- tal. Refinancing of such loans was to be obtained in domestic currency through local banks. April 1. Advance settlement requirements for imports were increased; for sight letters of credit the increase was from 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the value. April 1. Export financing loans by banks to manufacturers, other than loans for exports of machinery, were provided only up to 80 per cent of the amounts previously made available. April 1. The acceptance by domestic importers and manu- facturers from foreign suppliers or banks abroad of 108 short-term financing and/or usance letters of credit of less than one year was suspended. After meeting the advance settlement requirement, domestic importers and manufactur- ers could apply to appointed banks for loans in domestic currency for settlement of the balance. The rate of interest on these loans was fixed at 7% per cent per annum. April 1. Imports of machinery and equipment had to be made on a cash settlement basis when the amount involved was less than US$3 million and the terms of repayment were less than five years. After advance settlement of 20 per cent of the foreign exchange amount, importers and manufactur- ers could obtain domestic bank financing at 7V2 per cent a year for the remaining 80 per cent of the import value. May 3. The limitations imposed on April 1 on imports on a documents against acceptance (D/A) basis or a documents against payments (D/P) basis were removed. July 1. Consular invoices ceased to be required for imports. July 4. Certain limitations on permitted countries of origin for imports of bulk goods and industrial raw materials were lifted. Henceforth, these could be imported from any source other than mainland China, while previously restricted sources of origin included Hong Kong, Japan, Macao, Ma- laysia, and Singapore. July 17. The remittance facility for individuals was in- creased from US$100 to US$200 per transfer. July 17. The exchange allowances for study abroad were increased. Those for approved travel abroad were increased from US$600 to US$1,000 a person a trip (from US$300 to US$500 for children). The living expenses allowance for busi- ness travel was increased from US$1,000 to US$1,200 a month. August 10. The Central Bank made available domestic fi- nance up to a total of NT$1 billion to facilitate the financing of imports by small and medium-size enterprises of basic consumer goods and industrial raw materials. Such enter- prises were, in addition, urged to avail themselves of foreign currency loans available at the Central Bank at preferential interest rates of 5y2-7y2 per cent. August 22. Tariff reductions of about 50 per cent were announced for imports of nine industrial raw material prod- ucts. September 27. Exports of certain foodstuffs and fertilizers were prohibited. October 9. Export controls were imposed on additional commodities. These included chemicals, foodstuffs, and pa- per products. October 23. The country of origin requirement for 824 cate- gories of consumer goods imports was removed. These goods could now be imported from any country except mainland China, while previously the restricted sources of origin in- cluded Hong Kong, Japan, Macao, Malaysia, and Singapore. December 7. Import duties on 36 categories of foodstuffs and other basic consumer goods were reduced by 25-50 per cent, for a period of one year. December 22. The country of origin requirement for an- other 404 categories of consumer goods imports was re- moved. These goods could now be imported from any country except mainland China. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Exchange Rate System Administration of Control COLOMBIA 1 On December 17,1948, a par value for the Colombian Peso was established by Colombia with the Fund. However, ex- change transactions no longer take place at rates based on that par value. All exchange transactions are effected through the Bank of the Republic (the central bank) or the authorized banks in the official market —the exchange certificate market, in which the rate fluctuates. On January 1, 1974 the average selling rate in the certificate market was Col$24.89 per US$1. The peso equivalent of the Government's exchange receipts from the export tax on coffee is credited to the Treasury's Special Exchange Account at the central bank's accounting rate of Col$23.70 per US$1; the Government purchases ex- change for all public debt payments and other expenditures included in the national budget at the same exchange rate. There are also certain other effective exchange rates, some of which result from a system of tax credit certificates granted on export proceeds. The different exchange rates and the types of transaction to which they apply are set out in the Table of Exchange Rates, below. On January 1, 1974, the fluctuating buying rate for proceeds from coffee exports (after taking into account a 20 per cent exchange tax) was Col$19.91 per US$1, and that for most other exports about Col$28.62 per US$1. In principle, all imports are paid for at the certificate market rate, and all payments and receipts in respect of current invisibles and capital also take place at that rate; different effective rates, however, arise from the applica- tion of advance payments deposits for purchases of exchange for certain import payments and for many other purposes. A fixed rate of Col$20.00 per US$1 applies to certain petroleum transactions. The Bank of the Republic stands ready to sell to the public, against payment in pesos at the certificate market selling rate ruling on the date of issue, exchange warrants (titulos canjea- bles por certificados de cambio or titulos de divisas). These warrants, which are expressed in U.S. dollars, are negotiable, and may also be exchanged, provided that the holder presents an exchange license, for exchange certificates (for the same amount of foreign currency and free of charge); such ex- change must take place between 45 and 180 days after the date of issue. Within the period mentioned, warrants may also be sold to the Bank of the Republic for pesos, at the certificate market buying rate ruling on the date of repurchase and subject to a commission of 1 per mill. Warrants bear interest at 7 per cent per annum. Warrants held for more than 180 days but less than two years may be resold to the Bank at the certificate market rate ruling 180 days after issue. They be- come null and void two years after issue. Foreign payments made with certificate exchange that has been acquired against warrants are exempt from the 100 per cent advance payments deposit that must otherwise be lodged for many types of outward transfers. Between 45 and 180 days after issue, war- rants may also be used to purchase exchange for travel pur- poses. 1 In view of certain changes that took place on January 1, 1974 (see note at the end of this survey), this survey presents the position on that date. All imports and exports require prior registration at the Institute of Foreign Trade (iNCOMEx). Exchange for pay- ments must be purchased through the Bank of the Republic or the commercial banks, with an approved exchange license issued by the Exchange Office of the Bank of the Republic; however, payments for current transactions, when made through credit institutions, do not require prior exchange licenses. The Monetary Board periodically draws up a foreign exchange budget. It also establishes priorities within that budget for the delivery of exchange, after setting aside the amounts necessary to cover the obligations of the Bank of the Republic and to service the external debt of the public agen- cies and the National Federation of Coffee Growers. Overall import and export policy is determined by the Foreign Trade Council. The Institute of Foreign Trade, through its Import Board, controls imports that are subject to prior licensing. The National Council for Economic and Social Policy issues directives concerning direct investment in Colombia to the Exchange Office and the National Planning Department, which evaluates new projects. The Exchange Office of the Bank of the Republic keeps an accounting record both of foreign investment in Colombia and of debts abroad, and controls the movement of foreign capital as well as the trans- fer of profits, dividends, commissions, and royalties for trade- marks, patents, etc. The Superintendency of Exchange Control, which is an autonomous agency reporting to the Presidency of the Republic, enforces the control and supervi- sion over exchange transactions and is responsible for apply- ing penalties for any violation of the exchange regulations. Prescription of Currency Payments and receipts related to international transactions are normally effected in U.S. dollars. Settlements with Bul- garia, Eastern Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Spain, and Yugoslavia for commercial transactions must be made through clearing accounts in accordance with the provisions of the relevant bilateral payments agreement. Payments between Colombia and Argentina, Bolivia, Bra- zil, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Para- guay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela are made through accounts maintained within the framework of the LAFTA multilateral clearing system. Nonresident Accounts Credit establishments are authorized to receive short-term deposits in foreign currency from physical or juridical per- sons not resident in Colombia, and these deposits are freely available to the holders, but any foreign currency deposits that they may wish to convert into Colombian currency must be sold to the Bank of the Republic. Before releasing the accounts of nonresidents, banks must obtain authorization from the Exchange Office. 109 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution COLOMBIA Imports and Import Payments There is no prohibited import list. Imports are classified as follows: goods whose import is subject to prior licensing by the Institute of Foreign Trade; and goods that may be im- ported freely without license although subject to registration. In this last category, there are a global free list applicable to all countries, a National Free List applicable to LAFTA countries only, and a free list applicable to Andean Common Market countries only. Liberalized imports on the global free list at the beginning of 1974 corresponded to about 42 per cent of 1973 reimbursable imports. 2 All import registrations by public sector agencies are screened by the Institute of Foreign Trade to determine whether local substitutes are available. Import licenses for certain items are not normally issued; these include arms and habit-forming drugs, certain foodstuffs, certain textiles and garments, jewelry, and a num- ber of other consumer goods. Prior registration of the import transaction at the Institute of Foreign Trade is required for all imports other than those with an f.o.b. value of less than US$20 (or US$40 for books and Pharmaceuticals). The charge for import registration is Col$ 100.00 (in some cases Col$5.00) plus a consular invoice tax of 1 per cent. Advance import deposits (consignations) in Colombian currency of at least 35 per cent of the registered amount must be made with an authorized bank before import registration is permitted; the deposit may be used at any time to make import payments. 3 The following imports are the main exemptions from prior deposits: nonreimbursable imports (see footnote 2); imports brought into Colombia under special import-export arrange- ments (Vallejo Plan); all foodstuffs and agricultural inputs; all imports for the military and the police; all imports from Andean Group countries; imports by official entities when financed with foreign credits having a maturity of at least five years; imports from Spain (when financed under the bilateral payments agreement); goods imported by the National Fed- eration of Coffee Growers for its own use; goods exempt by virtue of an international agreement; goods of prime necessity imported by the Institute of Agricultural Marketing (IDEMA); most imports by universities and other nonprofit-making ed- ucational institutions; and books, newspapers, and maga- zines. The advance import deposit is calculated on the f.o.b. value of the goods, at the average selling rate for exchange certificates for the previous month, as determined by the Ministry of Finance (the "Ministry of Finance exchange rate"). The importer is issued a nonnegotiable noninter- est-bearing title (titulo de divisas) denominated in foreign currency and corresponding to the advance rniport deposit; 2 The term reimbursable imports generally covers imports financed from Colombia's own foreign exchange reserves or financed with foreign credit; they include imports under bilateral payments agreements. Nonreimbursable imports consist mainly of aid imports under grants, commodities constituting part of a direct investment, and goods financed by certain types of long-term loans. 3 Monetary Board Resolution No. 5 of January 23, 1974 increased the deposit requirement to 40 per cent (with effect from January 25), raised the percentage up to which the deposit may be used to make payments for imports other than the registered import transaction from 50 per cent to 100 per cent, and extended the exemptions from the deposit to all imports into the free ports of San Andres and Providencia when originating in bilateral payments agreement countries. 110 during its six-month validity the title may be used to purchase exchange for import payments, free of the 100 per cent ad- vance payments deposit, and at the expiration of this period the title, if unutilized, will be repurchased by the central bank at the original exchange rate. Under these arrangements, the importer is free to put up a deposit in excess of the prescribed minimum of 35 per cent of the registration amount. A prior exchange license issued by the Exchange Office is required for payments for imports. At least 20 days prior to filing an application for an exchange license, the importer must provide an advance payments deposit (deposito provi- sional) in pesos equivalent to 100 per cent of the exchange requested, calculated at the Ministry of Finance exchange rate (see above). Exemptions include import payments by the government departments, municipalities, and official agen- cies, and payments for imports financed with foreign credits extended to the Bank of the Republic, goods for general consumption imported by the Institute of Agricultural Mar- keting, payments for the crude oil acquired by the national petroleum company (Empresa Colombiana de Petroleos— ECOPETROL) for refining in Colombia, imports financed by U.S. AID credits, import payments made not later than 30 days after customs clearance (including import payments made in advance of shipment), and payments for imports from Spain when settled under the bilateral payments agree- ment with that country and financed by the Bank of the Republic, and import payments made with titles correspond- ing to advance import deposits. Import duties are calculated at the Ministry of Finance exchange rate. In addition to customs duties, there is an ad valorem tax on imports equal to 3 per cent of the c.i.f. value. Of the amounts collected, 50 per cent goes to the Export Promotion Fund, while the remaining 50 per cent goes to the National Coffee Fund. Exempt from this tax are imports by public entities, goods of LAFTA origin, and imports under the Vallejo Plan. Importers of goods financed by the U.S. AID are required to ship at least 50 per cent of the total volume of shipments on Colombian flag ships. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles are made at the exchange certificate rate. In principle, all payments for invisibles are subject to exchange licenses, which are granted according to officially established priorities determined by the Monetary Board; however, the Bank of the Republic may make payments abroad on behalf of credit institutions without prior exchange license, and commercial banks in cities where Exchange Of- fices are located may sell exchange directly for the purpose of foreign travel and may also transfer without prior approval the monthly allowances of students studying abroad with government support. No advance payments deposit is re- quired for invisibles. Payments for travel abroad are limited to US$40 a person a day, not to exceed US$1,400 a year; this limit may be raised to US$70 a day and US$6,300 a year when the travel may be especially beneficial to the country; trans- fers to professionals and technicians undertaking courses abroad are generally restricted to US$450 a month for up to ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution 12 months, while for other students the ceilings vary from US$200 to US$300 a month, depending on the cost of living in the country concerned. The Exchange Office, however, is empowered to grant larger allocations. Foreign tourists who have stayed in Colombia for a period not exceeding three months may, on leaving the country, purchase foreign cur- rency not exceeding US$60 on presentation of their boarding pass. Colombian nationals and resident foreigners are required to pay a travel tax of Col $500 whenever they leave the coun- try. Exports and Export Proceeds Certain exports are prohibited. No export licenses are re- quired. Prior application for registration, however, is required for all exports except crude oil, samples, and Colombian products in noncommercial quantities. If the application meets all legal requirements, approval is stamped on the ap- plication form, i.e., registration is granted. When registering an export transaction, the exporter must provide either a personal guarantee in pesos (but without depositing any funds) corresponding to the full export value or a bank guar- antee (usually for 30 per cent of the same value), to ensure that the proceeds will be surrendered to the Bank of the Republic. The periods for surrendering export proceeds are as follows: (1) for coffee exports, within 20 days from the date of registration of the export; (2) for banana exports, 50 per cent of the value must be surrendered within 30 days follow- ing the registration of the export, and the remaining 50 per cent within 60 days after the registration; and (3) for other exports, generally within 90 days from the same date. The Bank of the Republic is empowered in certain cases to retain a portion of the exchange proceeds surrendered by the exporter of any product to repay debts for imports under the Vallejo Plan incurred by the exporter concerned. All ex- change proceeds from exports, except those from the export of crude oil not produced by ECOPETROL, must be surren- dered to the Bank of the Republic. On surrendering their export proceeds to the Bank of the Republic, exporters of commodities other than coffee, raw cattle hides, or petroleum and petroleum products receive tax credit certificates (CATs) in an amount corresponding to a specified percentage of the total earnings surrendered, con- verted at the Ministry of Finance exchange rate. This ratio is 1 per cent for timber, hides and skins, platinum, emeralds, dairy products, and live animals; 13 per cent for many agri- cultural products; and 15 per cent for all other commodities (including bananas and gold; the 15 per cent is calculated on value added if the exports are manufactured goods). These certificates, which are freely negotiable and are quoted on the stock exchange, are accepted at par by tax offices three or six months after issuance for the payment of income tax, customs duties, and sales taxes. At the end of 1973 certificates just issued were quoted at a discount of about 18 per cent. The surrender of foreign currency earned by exports is carried out by exchanging the foreign currency for exchange certificates that are negotiable in the bankers' market. The certificates have a validity of 5 to 10 days, after which they COLOMBIA must be surrendered to the central bank at 90 per cent of the lowest certificate rate quoted by the Bank in the preceding week. The surrender price for exports other than coffee varies with fluctuations in prices in the world market. Coffee ex- ports are subject to the following additional regulations: (1) A minimum surrender price (reintegro) is fixed after deduc- tion for freight and insurance, at US$104.50 per 70-kilogram bag. (2) Exporters pay a tax in foreign exchange at the rate of 20 per cent ad valorem. Of this tax, 4 percentage points are paid to the National Coffee Fund while the remainder pro- vides revenue for the Treasury's Special Exchange Account, of which the net product forms a contribution to the national budget. The Special Exchange Account is credited at the Bank of the Republic's accounting rate of Col$23.70 per US$1. (3) Exporters must either surrender in the form of untreated coffee to the National Federation of Coffee Grow- ers and without payment the equivalent of 35 per cent of the volume of excelso coffee that they wish to export (retention) or pay the Federation the peso equivalent. (4) Exports of coffee are subject to an additional tax of 6 per cent ad valorem (pasilla tax); the tax must be paid, either in kind or in pesos, to the Federation. (5) A committee composed of the Ministers of Finance and Agriculture and the Managing Director of the Federation establishes a domestic buying price for ex- port-type coffee, expressed in pesos per arroba of 12.5 kilo- grams. (6) Whenever the domestic support price, net of taxes and freight, exceeds a level corresponding to a spot New York price of US$0.57 a pound, the excess (net of taxes and levies) is shared among producer, Coffee Fund, and local produc- ers* committees at a ratio of 35:30:35; in that event, the reten- tion is to be increased and the proceeds of the increase are paid to the Coffee Fund and the producers' committees. Anticipated export proceeds from coffee may be provision- ally surrendered in advance of actual surrender (when prefi- nanced by foreign buyers) provided that the latter takes place within 60 days of the provisional surrender, at a provisional exchange rate of Col$20.50 per US$1. 4 The peso payment to the coffee exporter at the time of actual surrender is based on the certificate market rate on the day of advance surrender. Proceeds from Invisibles All exchange receipts from invisibles must be surrendered; they are converted at the certificate market buying rate. Capital All inward and outward capital transfers are effected at the certificate market rate. All foreign investment in Colombia, all new foreign loans, direct lines of foreign credit obtained by nonbank residents, 5 and the movement of capital previously imported (except loans previously registered under Decree No. 2322 of Septem- ber 2, 1965) must be registered with the Exchange Office of 4 This term may be extended by another 60 days. 5 Suppliers' credits of a once-for-aU nature do not require registration; their repayment is authorized by the exchange license covering the relevant import transaction. Such repayment, however, is subject to the 100 per cent advance payments deposit. In addition, such credits are subject to an interest rate ceiling of 1 % per cent over the six-month London interbank rate. I ll ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution COLOMBIA the Bank of the Republic. 6 Capital imports also require prior approval by the National Planning Department in accor- dance with directives issued by the National Council for Eco- nomic and Social Policy; capital for the petroleum industry or for other mineral exploration in addition requires approval by the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum. Capital registration entitles the investor to export profits and to repatriate capital at the certificate market rate on certain conditions specified in Resolution No. 17 of July 19,1972 by the National Council for Economic and Social Policy. The transfer of profits is limited to 14 per cent of the net capital value in any one year (beginning with profits earned in 1968), except for profits resulting from investments of outstanding importance or in- volving special risks in view of the circumstances prevailing in the international money market. If in any year the earnings remitted are less than 14 per cent, the balance may be remit- ted in subsequent years, provided that the additional remit- tances do not exceed 3 per cent a year. New investments may be granted exemptions from import duty and from advance deposit and import license requirements. Capital invested in the petroleum industry is subject to special rules and to con- tractual provisions. Foreign loans contracted by private Colombian individuals or firms are generally subject to a minimum maturity of four years and to an interest rate ceiling of 1 % per cent over the monthly average of the six-month London interbank rate. Such loans normally are permitted only when needed as working capital for manufacturing enterprises or for direct investment in industrial or agricultural activity. Contracts involving royalties, commissions, trademarks or patents, and similar arrangements must be registered with the Exchange Office to enable the beneficiary to make transfers abroad. They require approval by the Royalties Committee before they can be registered. Colombian nationals who have invested abroad must sur- render to the Bank of the Republic not only the interest, profits, commissions, and royalties but also the proceeds of the sale or liquidation of the principal investment at the pre- vailing certificate market rate. Exports of capital by residents are restricted and such exports by private individuals are not normally permitted. Gold Physical and juridical persons may trade in Colombia in gold coins for collection purposes only. With this exception, only the Bank of the Republic is entitled to purchase, sell, hold, import, or export gold. The Bank of the Republic pur- chases the gold produced in the country at US$38 an ounce7 and is empowered to pay up to 50 per cent in foreign currency on presentation by foreign capital mining companies of ex- change licenses entitling them to make payments abroad for services, dividends, capital repayments, taxes, etc. The re- maining 50 per cent and all payments to the small producers 6 At the end of 1973, the registration of certain foreign investments and of old contracts involving payment of royalties, commissions, etc., had not yet been completed. 7 On January 30, 1974 the Bank's purchase price was increased to US$42.22 an ounce. 112 are paid in pesos at the certificate market exchange rate. On selling their gold to the Bank of the Republic, the producers receive tax credit certificates equivalent to 15 per cent of the value of the gold sold. The certificates held by the small producers are bought by the Bank of the Republic in Colom- bian pesos at their market value. The Bank of the Republic, which exports gold at world market prices, at the same time pays the producer a bonus or premium consisting of the difference between the average quotation in the international market during the previous week and the official price of gold. The Bank of the Republic makes domestic sales of gold for industrial use either direct or through the Colombian Mining Association at a price equivalent to the average quotation in the free external gold markets during the previous month; this price is translated into pesos at the prevailing selling rate of exchange certificates on the date of sale. Imports and exports of gold are a monopoly of the Bank of the Republic; imports of nonmonetary gold are not normally undertaken. The assay and refining houses and the mining companies producing gold are under the supervision of the Superinten- dency of Exchange Control. In addition, the mining compa- nies must obtain a license from the Superintendency in order to carry on their operations. The Bank of the Republic from time to time strikes com- memorative gold coins which are legal tender. Residents and nonresidents may freely buy such coins, but export licenses are not normally granted. Changes during 1973 During the year, the selling rate in the certificate exchange market was gradually depreciated from Col$22.83 per U.S. dollar to Col$24.89 per U.S. dollar. Import restrictions were relaxed significantly and the system of advance import depos- its was reorganized. Changes in the system of tax credit certif- icates for exports resulted in an increased number of effective exchange rates. The restrictions on borrowing abroad were eased. January 1. By virtue of Decree No. 1841 of September 30, 1972 the tax credit certificate rate for exports of emeralds was lowered from 15 per cent to 12 per cent. January L The suspension of most private borrowing abroad (which had been in effect in November and December 1972) was terminated. Private external loans converted after January 1, 1973 had to conform to the following conditions: (1) The amortization period must not be less than 48 months. (2) The interest rate must not exceed that set by the Monetary Board. (3) Such loans were permitted only if it was shown to the satisfaction of the Exchange Office that they were needed as working capital for manufacturing enterprises or for direct investments in industrial or agricultural activities that were in conformity with the legal purpose of the borrowing enter- prise. The extension or refinancing of older loans had to conform to the regulations covering new loans. (Monetary Board Resolution No. 69 of 1972.) January L The exchange applications for payments for imports effected before June 30, 1971 had to be accompanied by a deposit corresponding to 150 per cent of the exchange value. Two thirds could be used as payment for the foreign ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution exchange, while the remainder would be repaid after 90 days. As from February 1, 1973 the deposit requirement would increase to 200 per cent, of which one half could be used to pay for the exchange, and the other half would be repaid after 90 days. The exchange applications in question would be exempt from the provisional 95 per cent deposit requirement. (Monetary Board Resolution No. 75 of 1972.) January 15. By virtue of Resolution No. 1 of October 3, 1972 of the Royalty Commission, all remittances abroad re- lating to film distribution contracts required the prior ap- proval of the Royalty Commission. January 17. The exchange rate for the actual surrender of export proceeds from commodities other than coffee, where advance surrender had taken place, was changed from the certificate market rate on the day of actual surrender to the certificate market rate on the day of advance surrender. (Monetary Board Resolution No. 2.) January 24. Exports of rice were suspended. January 31. The coffee retention quota was raised from the equivalent of 30 per cent to 31.64 per cent of coffee exports. (Decree No. 152.) Table of Exchange Rates (as at January 1, 1 9 7 4) COLOMBIA January 31. The minimum surrender price per 70-kilogram bag of coffee was raised from US$91.20 to US$102. (Mone- tary Board Resolution No. 3.) February 13. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the certificate rate of exchange was maintained unchanged. February 14. The maximum term for import credits granted by domestic credit institutions was increased from 180 days to 15 months for imports under the Vallejo Plan. (Monetary Board Resolution No. 4.) February 20. INCOMEX Resolution No. 005 transferred some 200 tariff items to the free import list. The transferred items represented about Col $100 million on an annual basis and consisted mainly of machinery and industrial inputs. The coverage of the free list thus was increased to about 43 per cent of reimbursable imports in 1972. February 21. General Circular No. 10 of the Exchange Office clarified that, contrary to General Circular No. 25 of July 5, 1972, direct suppliers' credit was not subject to the registration and maximum maturity requirements applicable to direct lines of credit.

The average rate in the certificate market in the previous month (December 1973) as determined by the Ministry of Finance was Col$24.68 per US$1. 11 The central bank purchases gold from domestic producers at a price corresponding to the world market price of gold, calculated at the same effective rate as for exports of commodities eligible for that buying rate (i.e., at Col$28.62 per US$1 at the end of 1973). 12 Except specified exports of manufactured goods, for which tax credit certificates are granted on the basis of value added rather than export value; this practice results in an additional effective exchange rate. 13 This rate is also used as a computation rate to determine the price in pesos which ECOPETROL and foreign-owned companies receive for domestic sales of crude petroleum. 14 A different effective rate arises from the application of the 100 per cent advance payments deposit required for purchases of exchange for many purposes. 113 ©International Monetary Fund.

Monetary Board Resolution No. 10 increased the minimum surrender price for coffee exports to US$108 a bag. March 8. Decree No. 356 increased the coffee retention quota to the equivalent of 37.16 per cent of coffee exports. March 21. Monetary Board Resolution No. 13 exempted all public sector agencies from the special advance import deposits (for imports effected before June 30, 1971) that had been imposed under Resolution No. 75 of 1972 (see Janu- ary 1, above). March 21. Monetary Board Resolution No. 14 set a new, uniform interest rate ceiling of 10 per cent on private external loans, on special direct lines of credit for the financing of imports of capital goods and intermediate goods needed for the manufacture of durable consumer goods, and on direct lines of credit for export financing. (The previous maximum interest rates for these types of external credit covered by Monetary Board Resolution No. 61 of 1972 had been 8-8.5 per cent, depending on maturity.) The interest rate ceiling on direct lines of credit granted by foreign banks for other im- port financing was increased from 6.5 per cent to 8.5 per cent. March 21. Law No. 8 ratified Colombia's signature of the Andean Subregional Agreement of May 26, 1969 (Cartagena Agreement). March 29. Law No. 5 reduced the tax credit certificate rate for agricultural exports from 15 per cent to 13 per cent (see also August 9, below). March 29. Decree No. 498 lowered the coffee retention quota to the equivalent of 35 per cent of coffee, exports. April 5. The Government announced that meat exports in 1973 would be reduced by 50 per cent. May 11. Monetary Board Resolution No. 21 revoked Reso- lutions Nos. 70 and 75 of 1972 and introduced an additional type of advance import deposit (consignation). In order to obtain exchange licenses for import payments, the importer had to lodge a local currency deposit with the central bank equivalent to 10 per cent of the total value of the import registration, converted at the Ministry of Finance rate, before registration. The central bank would credit the amount to a special account in the name of the importer, and in exchange for the deposit issue him a certificate denominated in foreign currency (calculated at the exchange rate in effect on the day of import registration). Such certificates could be used at any time by the importer for partial payment of the import, in- cluding advance payments, downpayments, or payments af- ter customs clearance; for these payments, the advance payment deposit of 95 per cent of the value was not required. The importer could resell the certificates to the central bank, at the exchange rate prevailing on the day of resale, if INCOMEX had accepted the registration, or at the exchange rate used to calculate the deposit, if INCOMEX had rejected the registration. Exempt from the new deposit requirement were all non- reimbursable imports, as well as such reimbursable imports of foodstuffs and raw materials for agriculture as might be determined by the Executive Council for External Commerce. Imports under the Vallejo Plan, however, were subject to the 114 new deposits. Whereas the old import deposit (deposito previo ) could not be released until customs clearance, the new deposit (consignation) could be used at any time to make import payments. May 11. Monetary Board Resolution No. 22 established that with effect from May 14, 1973 the Bank of the Republic and authorized credit institutions would no longer convert the foreign exchange proceeds from private external loans into pesos unless they had been approved by the Exchange Office prior to May 11. The Exchange Office was authorized to grant exchange licenses for the full or partial advance repayment of external private loans registered under the sys- tems in force prior to Monetary Board Resolution No. 69 of 1972. May 14. INCOMEX Resolution No. 015 exempted certain fertilizers and certain foodstuffs from the 10 per cent advance import deposit when imported by IDEMA. May 14. INCOMEX Resolution No. 016 required certificates issued by INCOMEX for exports of specified agricultural com- modities. May 16. Monetary Board Resolution No. 24 established that the 10 per cent advance import deposit (Resolution No. 21) was to be considered as a minimum, and that the importer had the option of making a larger deposit. May 18. INCOMEX Resolution No. 018 transferred several food items from the prohibited import list to the prior ap- proval list. May 18. INCOMEX Resolution No. 019 exempted numer- ous food and fertilizer items from the 10 per cent advance import deposit requirement. May 18. INCOMEX Resolution No. 020 transferred some 420 tariff items from the prior approval list to the free import list. May 30. Monetary Board Resolution No. 26 changed the exchange rate for advance surrender of export proceeds from the Ministry of Finance rate on the date of advance surrender to the certificate market rate on that day. Thus the rate for advance surrender was made equal to the rate for final surren- der. June 13. Monetary Board Resolution No. 29 increased the travel allowance from US$30 a person a day, subject to a limit of US$1,050 a person a year, to US$40 a person a day with a limit of US$1,400 a person a year. The advance deposit requirement of 50 per cent for purchases of travel exchange was abolished. June 14. INCOMEX Resolution No. 025 transferred a large number of tariff items from the list of prohibited imports to the prior approval list. June 14. Decree No. 1121 terminated the advance import deposit requirements in force prior to those of Monetary Board Resolution No. 21. At the same time, Monetary Board Resolution No. 30 incorporated the suspended rates of ad- vance deposit into the new advance import deposit system of Resolution No. 21. The new minimum advance import deposit rates were as follows: (1) for imports which had been exempted from the old advance import deposit requirement, 10 per cent of the total value of the import registration; (2) for imports previ- ously subject to a 1 per cent deposit requirement, 11 per cent; ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution (3) imports which had been subject to an advance deposit of 5 per cent were subject to a rate of 16 per cent; and (4) imports which had been subject to the highest rate, 10 per cent, were subject to a rate of 21 per cent. July 4. Monetary Board Resolution No. 31 established an interest rate ceiling of 10.5 per cent for (1) external loans obtained by banks and financial corporations (previously 8- 8.5 per cent, depending on maturity); (2) direct external lines of credit for import financing (previously 8.5 per cent) as well as special direct lines of credits (previously 10 per cent); and (3) private external loans (previously 10 per cent). The ceiling under (3) would also apply to those private external loans registered prior to Monetary Board Resolution No. 22 of May 11, 1973 under original contracts calling for periodic interest rate adjustments. July 6. Monetary Board Resolution No. 34 exempted books and all imports under the Vallejo Plan from advance import deposits. Exchange licenses for payments for imports of machinery and equipment by public work contractors refi- nanced by the Fondo Vial Nacional were exempted from the 95 per cent advance payment deposit. July 10. INCOMEX Resolution No. 029 introduced restric- tions on exports of iron, steel, and their by-products. July 25. Monetary Board Resolution No. 38 changed the interest rate ceiling established by Resolution No. 31 of July 4 from a flat 10.5 per cent per annum to 1.5 percentage points above the six-month London interbank rate. August 1. Monetary Board Resolution No. 41 exempted imports of equipment for the military forces and the police from advance import deposits. Also exempted were imports in connection with the international fair to be held in Bogo- ta in July 1974. August 9. Decree No. 1561 provided that, in accordance with Law No. 5 /73, Article 21, the Bank of the Republic would withhold 2 percentage points from the tax credit certif- icates issued for specified agricultural products. The resulting rate of tax credit certificate was 13 per cent. August 10. INCOMEX Resolution No. 883 required the prior approval of the Natural Resource Development Insti- tute (INDERENA) for imports and exports of live animals. August 14. Exports of long-fiber cotton were suspended. August 14. Monetary Board Resolution No. 42 abolished the system of advance surrender of export proceeds for minor exports, i.e., all exports other than coffee. August 14. Monetary Board Resolution No. 43 increased the advance payment deposit from 95 per cent to 100 per cent of the amount of the exchange license. The advance payment deposit ceased to be required for (1) import payments in advance of shipment; (2) import payments made within 15 calendar days of customs clearance; and (3) goods imported with financing from a special credit facility in the central bank for machinery and equipment for manufacturing industries. August 14. INCOMEX Resolution No. 034 exempted speci- fied chemicals, fertilizers, and tractors from advance import deposits. August 14. INCOMEX Resolution No. 037 eliminated the prohibited import list transferring all items on this list to the prior licensing list. The Resolution also contained a reissue of the import free list. COLOMBIA August 14. INCOMEX Resolution No. 038 exempted 138 tariff items from advance import deposits. August 29. With effect from September 3, Monetary Board Resolution No. 46 increased the minimum advance import deposit rates from 10, 11, 16, and 21 per cent to 19, 20, 25, and 30 per cent. August 29. Monetary Board Resolution No. 47 amended the regulations applying to private external loans for the purpose of financing the construction of new factories and other projects of economic and social interest (as regulated in Article 131 of Decree No. 444 of 1967). Prior to contracting a loan to be used in whole or in part for imports, the debtor was required to obtain from INCOMEX an import registration and import license (or global import license) specifying that the import transaction was nonreimbursable. The Exchange Office could not register such loans if they were contracted to pay for imports covered by licenses for reimbursable im- ports that had been issued before August 29. Loans of these types (i.e., in conformity with Article 131 of Decree No. 444 of 1967) intended in part for the payment of technical services abroad could only be registered by the Exchange Office when that Office had previously authorized both the service con- tract and the payment. The interest ceiling for credits dealt with in this Resolution was the same as that for other external credit operations. Suppliers' credits could not be registered under the Resolu- tion.

Decree No. 1996 modified the valuation basis for the tax credit certificates granted on specified ex- ports of manufac tured products (under the Vallejo Plan) f rom total export value to value added, w i th effect f rom January 1, 1974. The same Decree empowered IDEMA to act as sole exporter of any agricultural product. September 29. Decree No. 1997 increased the validity of tax credit certificates from three or six months to eleven months, 115 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution COLOMBIA with effect from October 1, 1973. The Decree was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. September 29.

October 3. The advance import deposit rates were increased to a uniform minimum rate of 35 per cent, to be calculated at the Ministry of Finance exchange rate. Exempt from im- port deposit requirements were all nonreimbursable imports and all food items, agricultural inputs, books, imports under the Vallejo Plan, imports for the military and the police, imports by official entities obtained with foreign credit of at least five years, and goods for the international fair in July 1974; these exemptions were additional to those in Monetary Board Resolution No. 43. (Monetary Board Resolution No. 60.) October 31. The exemption from advance import deposit requirements was extended to all imports from countries of the Andean Common Market. The exemption from the 100 per cent advance payments deposit was extended to all goods for which payments were made within 30 days from customs clearance. (Monetary Board Resolution No. 65.) November 20. INCOMEX Resolution No. 056 established a list of permitted exports, a list of prohibited exports (includ- ing live cattle, sheep, and pigs, mutton and pork, poultry, bacon, milk, eggs, certain types of grains, animal and vegeta- ble oils, refined sugar, cacao, hides and skins, timber, speci- fied iron and steel products, zinc, tin, and lead), and a list of exports requiring prior approval (including sugarcane, raw sugar, specified milling products, sulphur, specified chemi- cals, plastic tubes, and paper products). December 5. Monetary Board Resolution No. 72 modified the advance import deposit system introduced by Resolution No. 21. The minimum deposit rate was maintained at 35 per cent, but the deposit would now be calculated at the certifi- cate market rate, and the titles issued to importers could henceforth also be used, up to 50 per cent of the amount of foreign exchange taken up, to make payments for imports other than those to which the registration and the certificate were related. The deposits had to be lodged with commercial banks, which were to transfer them to the central bank within a day. The titles were nonnegotiable and noninterest-bearing and their validity was limited to six months; any unused titles could at the end of their validity be resold to the central bank at the original rate of exchange. Payments made with titles remained exempt from the advance payments deposit. December 5. Monetary Board Resolution No. 72 added imports from Spain financed under the bilateral payments agreement with that country to the exemptions from advance payments deposits and advance import deposits listed in Monetary Board Resolutions Nos. 43 and 60. December 17. Monetary Board Resolution No. 75 created a line of credit of US$30 million to finance imports from Eastern European countries with which bilateral trade agree- ments were in force. December 17. Monetary Board Resolution No. 76 changed the accounting exchange rate of the central bank from Col$22.00 per US$1 to Col$23.70 per US$1, to be applicable for the first time to the balance sheet for December 1973. December 20. Applications for nonreimbursable imports by foreign mining and petroleum companies required prior approval by the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum. NOTE.—The following change took place early in 1974: January 1. By virtue of Decree No. 1998 of September 29, 1973 the rates of tax credit certificates on exports of timber, hides and skins, platinum, emeralds, dairy products, and live animals were reduced to 1 per cent. By Decree No. 1996 of the same date, the valuation basis for exports under the Val- lejo Plan was changed from total export value to value added. 116 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO Exchange Rate System No par value for the currency of the People's Republic of the Congo has been established with the Fund. The unit of currency is the CFA Franc,l which is officially maintained at the rate of CFAF 1 = 0.02 French franc. Exchange trans- actions in French francs, the intervention currency, between the Banque des Etats de 1'Afrique Cent rale (BEAC) and com- mercial banks take place at the rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. Exchange transactions relating to foreign countries other than France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories except the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas), Mo- naco, and the Operations Account countries of the French Franc Area, take place in a dual exchange market, at rates based on the fixed rate for the French franc and the Paris exchange rate for the foreign currency concerned in either the official exchange market or the financial franc market. Settle- ments eligible for the official exchange market are payments and receipts in respect of imports, exports, and most other current transactions, as well as all current payments by or in favor of domestic and foreign public authorities and public bodies. All other settlements with foreign countries, as well as transactions in banknotes of foreign countries and bank- notes issued by the BEAC, take place through the financial franc market at freely fluctuating rates. The principal current payments and receipts channeled through the financial franc market are those relating to travel expenses, capital earnings, and workers' remittances. Exchange rates for certain Euro- pean currencies in the official market are based on par values and central rates; the effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar in this market is not confined within any announced margins. Payments to the following countries, although subject to declaration, are unrestricted: (1) France (as defined above) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, Dahomey, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Togo, and Upper Volta). Settlements and investment transactions with all for- eign countries, however, are subject to control. Foreign countries are defined as all countries outside the People's Republic of the Congo. Payments to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries (as well as the purchase of their banknotes and travelers checks) are subject to a com- mission of 1 per cent, subject to a minimum of CFAF 100; exempt are payments of the State, the Postal Administration, and the BEAC, the salaries of Congolese diplomats abroad, the expenditures of official missions abroad, and the scholar- ships of persons studying or training abroad. Most payments to other foreign countries and credits to Foreign Accounts in Francs are subject to a commission of 1 per cent or, for foreign exchange purchased by Diamond Purchase Offices, 1 The CFA franc circulating in the People's Republic of the Congo is issued by the Banque des Etats de 1'Afrique Centrale (BEAC) and is legal tender also in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, and Gabon. 0.50 per cent; this commission also is subject to a minimum of CFAF 100. Administration of Control The Office of External Financial Relations in the Ministry of Finance and the Budget supervises borrowing and lending abroad, the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Congo, and inward and outward direct invest- ment. Exchange control is administered by the Minister of Finance and the Budget, who has delegated his approval authority to the Office of External Financial Relations and the authorized banks. All exchange transactions must be ef- fected through authorized banks or the Postal Administra- tion. Import and export licenses are issued by the Foreign Trade Office in the Ministry of Economic Affairs, except those for gold, which are granted by the Office of External Financial Relations. Prescription of Currency The People's Republic of the Congo is an Operations Ac- count country of the French Franc Area, since the BEAC maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury; settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the other Operations Account countries of the French Franc Area are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury. Settlements with the Peo- ple's Republic of China are made through special accounts established under a bilateral payments agreement. 2 Settle- ments with all other countries are usually made in any of the currencies of those countries or in French francs through Foreign or Financial Accounts in Francs. All payments to Portugal require the prior approval of the Ministry of Finance and the Budget. All settlements between Congo and Rhode- sia are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. The crediting of BEAC banknotes to Financial Accounts in Francs is permitted when they have been mailed direct to the BEAC agency in Brazza- ville by the foreign correspondents of authorized banks. Imports and Import Payments Imports of virtually all commodities from countries in the French Franc Area and from EEC countries other than France may be made freely. All imports of Portuguese or Rhodesian origin are prohibited. Imports from all non-EEC countries outside the French Franc Area are subject to licens- ing in accordance with an annual import program; the pro- gram also includes indicative quotas for a few commodities from EEC countries other than France. This program is de- 2 There are inoperative payments agreements with Bulgaria, North Korea, and Mali. 117 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO termined by a joint French-Congolese Committee. The im- port program does not include petroleum imports, for which a joint quota is set for the countries of the Central African Customs and Economic Union (UDEAC). Also outside the program are imports for the Goverment under foreign aid and bilateral payments agreements and imports made by the Of- fice National du Commerce (OFNACOM). The quotas for non-EEC countries may be used to import goods originating in any country outside the French Franc Area. Licenses for liberalized commodities originating in EEC countries other than France are issued automatically. Imports from non-UDEAC countries of certain goods are not permitted unless the importer also buys a certain quantity of the local product (jumelage). OFNACOM has a monopoly over certain imports, including hardware, rice, and salted fish from all sources, certain cotton piece goods from Japan, and certain other textiles from the People's Republic of China. All import transactions relating to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Ac- count countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Licenses for imports from countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries require the visa of the Foreign Trade Bureau and that of the Office of External Financial Relations. The ap- proved import license entitles importers to purchase the nec- essary exchange, provided that the shipping documents are submitted to the authorized bank. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Mo- naco, and the other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area are permitted freely provided they have been declared and are made through an authorized intermedi- ary; those to other foreign countries are subject to approval. For many types of payment the approval authority has been delegated to authorized banks. Payments for invisibles re- lated to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade trans- action has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted freely when the basic transaction has been approved. Resident tour- ists traveling to foreign countries other than France (as de- fined above), Monaco, Operations Account countries of the French Franc Area, or Zaire may obtain an exchange alloca- tion of an amount equivalent to CFAF 175,000 a person a trip (CFAF 87,500 for children under ten) for any number of trips a year; any foreign exchange remaining after return to Congo in excess of CFAF 5,000 must be surrendered. For business travel to such foreign countries, there is a special allocation of the equivalent of CFAF 20,000 a person a day, subject to a maximum of CFAF 400,000 a trip. Addi- tional amounts of foreign exchange for business travel may be authorized in appropriate cases. The use of credit cards abroad by residents is prohibited. There are special facilities for travelers to Kinshasa who request no foreign means of payment other than Zairian banknotes. The transfer of the entire net salary of a foreigner working in Congo is permitted 118 upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher, provided that the transfer takes place within three months of the pay period. Residents traveling to France (as defined above), Monaco, or an Operations Account country may take out CFAF 25,000 in BEAC banknotes. Resident and nonresident travelers going to foreign countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, Operations Account countries, or Zaire may freely take out up to a maximum of CFAF 10,000 in BEAC banknotes, French banknotes, and banknotes is- sued by any other institute of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Rhodesia are prohibited. Most exports to countries in the French Franc Area may be made freely; among the exceptions are commodities exported by the Na- tional Marketing Office for Agricultural Products (Office Na- tional de Commercialisation des Produits Agricoles, or ONCPA) or other state enterprises having an export monop- oly. All other exports require individual licenses. Proceeds from exports to foreign countries must be col- lected and repatriated, generally within 180 days of arrival of the commodities at their destination. Export proceeds must be surrendered within a month of the due date. All export transactions relating to countries other than France (as de- fined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Proceeds from Invisibles All amounts due from residents of foreign countries in respect of services and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be collected when due and surren- dered within a month of the due date. Resident and nonresi- dent travelers may bring in any amount of banknotes and coins issued by the BEAC, the Bank of France, or any other bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign banknotes and coins (except gold coins). Capital All capital movements between Congo and Rhodesia are prohibited. Movements of funds between Congo and France (as defined above), Monaco, and other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area are free, although subject to declaration; most investment operations and borrowing and lending between Congo and these countries are subject to authorization. Capital transfers to all other countries re- quire exchange control approval and are restricted, but capi- tal receipts from such countries generally are permitted freely. All foreign securities, foreign currency, and titles embodying claims on foreign countries or nonresidents that are held in Congo by residents or nonresidents must be deposited with authorized banks in Congo. Special controls (additional to any exchange control re- quirements that may be applicable) are maintained over bor- rowing and lending abroad, over inward and outward direct investment, and over the issuing, advertising, and offering for ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution sale of foreign securities in Congo; these controls relate to the transactions themselves, not to payments or receipts. Direct investments abroad 3 require the prior approval of the Minister of Finance and the Budget; the full or partial liquidation of such investments also requires the prior ap- proval of the Minister. Foreign direct investments in the Congo 4 require the prior approval by the Minister of Fi- nance, unless they involve the creation of a mixed economy enterprise. The full or partial liquidation of direct investments in Congo must be declared to the Minister. Both the making and the liquidation of direct investments, whether these are Congolese investments abroad or foreign investments in Congo, must be reported to the Minister within 20 days following each operation. Direct investments are defined as investments implying control of a company or enterprise. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign secu- rities in Congo requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. Exempt from authorization, however, are opera- tions in connection with (1) borrowing backed by a guarantee from the Congolese Government and (2) shares similar to securities whose issue, advertising, or offering for sale in Congo has previously been authorized. Borrowing by residents from nonresidents requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance and the Budget. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans constituting a direct investment in Congo for which prior approval has been obtained as indicated above; (2) loans contracted by registered banks; and (3) loans other than those mentioned above, when the total amount outstanding of these loans does not exceed CFAF 10 million for any one borrower. The contracting of loans that are free of authorization, and each repayment thereon, must be reported to the Office of External Financial Relations within 20 days of the operation. Lending by residents to nonresidents is subject to exchange control. In addition, lending to nonresidents requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance and the Budget. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans granted by registered banks; (2) other loans when the total amount outstanding of these loans does not exceed CFAF 5 million for any one lender; and (3) loans whose interest rate does not exceed 5 per cent a year and whose maturity is two years or less. The making of loans that are free of authorization, and each repayment thereon, must be re- ported to the Office of External Financial Relations within 20 days of the operation. 5 Under the Investment Code of April 26, 1973 (Ordinance No. 11/73), a number of privileges may be granted to ap- proved foreign investments. The Code provides for four cate- gories of preferential treatment. * Including those made through the intermediary of foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in Congo and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Congo. 4 Including those involving the cession between nonresidents of a participa- tion in the capital of a Congolese company. 5 On January 23, 1974 all lending in CFA francs to nonresidents was prohibited unless special authorization was obtained. PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO Gold By virtue of Decree No. 66/236 of July 29, 1966, as amended by Decree No. 66/265, of August 29, 1966, resi- dents are free to hold in Congo gold in the form of coins, art objects, or jewelry, but they require the prior authorization of the Minister of Finance and the Budget to hold gold in any other form or to import or export gold in any form from or to any other country. Exempt from the latter requirement are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the Treasury or the BEAC and (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles). Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. The agency SOGA- REM has a monopoly over the export of newly mined gold. Changes during 1973 January 3. Order No. 0003 established the commissions for 1973 on transfers to countries not linked to the French Trea- sury by an Operations Account at 1 per cent (except for transfers of diplomatic officials' salaries, students' scholar- ships, and payments for the account of the Congolese Trea- sury) and 0.50 per cent (for foreign currency purchased by Diamond Purchase Offices to the debit of their Foreign Ac- counts in Francs). February 13. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the exchange rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02 was maintained; the effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously CFAF 255.785 = US$1, became CFAF 230.207 = US$1. February 28. Order No. 0866 introduced certain additional exemptions from the 1 per cent transfer commission. They included exemptions for all transfers of the Postal Adminis- tration and the BEAC. March 8. The regulations concerning the import and export of domestic and foreign means of payment were modified by Order No. 1095. March 19. With the entry into effect of new margins ar- rangements between the French franc and certain other Euro- pean currencies, and the maintenance of the exchange rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02, the CFA franc began to appreciate in terms of the U.S. dollar. April 2. The Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique Equatoriale et du Cameroun (BCEAEC) was replaced by the Banque des Etats de 1'Afrique Centrale (BEAC). April 26. Ordinance No. 11/73 introduced a new Invest- ment Code. Law No. 39/61, as modified by Law No. 45/62, was revoked. July. The Malagasy Republic and Mauritania ceased to be Operations Account countries. Consequently, the exchange control regulations and transfer commissions applicable to the French Franc Area countries ceased to be applicable to these two countries. August 25. The People's Republic of the Congo ceased to invoke Article XXXV of the GATT in respect of Japan. 119 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution COSTA RICA Exchange Rate System The par value agreed with the International Monetary Fund on February 1, 1965 is 0.134139 gram of fine gold per Costa Rican Colon. No transactions take place at the par value. l There is a dual exchange market. The Central Bank buys and sells exchange in the official market at fixed rates of £ 6.62 and 0 6.68, respectively, per US$1. The official market rates apply to export proceeds from bananas pro- duced by foreign-owned companies, coffee, sugar, and certain other traditional products; listed imports classified as essen- tial; 2 receipts from and payments for specified invisibles; most capital receipts and debt service payments of the public sector; and registered private capital inflows and their service payments. Official transactions with CACM countries, when settled through the Camara de Compensacion Cen- troamericana (a clearinghouse established by the central banks of Central America to foster the process of economic integration of their countries) are effected at a uniform buying and selling rate of £ 6.625 per US$1; transactions with these countries that are not eligible for the official market and are settled in non-CACM currencies may be effected at the free market rate. Two mixing rates of 0 7.5825 and 0 7.58 per US$1 apply to nontraditional exports to the CACM and to the rest of the world, respectively; 50 per cent of such exports is sold in the official market and 50 per cent in the free market. A mixing rate of 0 7.3688 per US$1 is applicable to proceeds from bananas exported by independent local growers; 39 per cent of their proceeds are sold in the free market and 61 per cent in the official market (certain additional mixing rates for exports are listed below in the section on Exports and Export Proceeds). All other sales and purchases of foreign exchange may be made freely in the free market in which the exchange rates also are fixed; on December 31, 1973, the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar in this market were £ 8.54 and £ 8.60, respectively. Further mixing rates may arise from the following arrange- ments: (1) coffee exporters incurring promotional expendi- tures abroad may sell up to 5 per cent of their export proceeds in the free market; (2) re-export industries may sell in the free market 50 per cent of the value added which is incorporated in their exports; and (3) transfers at the official rate of interest and dividends on registered capital may be limited to a certain percentage of the registered amount, while amounts in excess of that percentage can be transferred through the free market. The Central Bank stands ready in principle to buy U.S. dollars forward at 90 days, in the official market only, at (2 6.50415 per US$1; however, no transactions have taken place for some time, as a result primarily of the existence of the dual exchange market.

This par value, which came into effect on October 16, 1973, was not agreed with the Fund. 2 However, some goods that are otherwise payable at the free market rate are eligible for the official rate when imported from CACM countries or Panama. Similarly, certain export commodities are eligible for a mixing rate only when sold to countries outside Central America. 120 cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from February 1, 1965. Administration of Control The exchange controls are operated by the Central Bank of Costa Rica. Purchases and sales of official market exchange are made through the Central Bank or through commercial banks acting as its agents. The free exchange market is con- ducted by commercial banks, acting as agents of the Central Bank, and licensed exchange houses. Commercial banks deal in this market only as agents of the Central Bank, for its account and at its risk. Other residents do not require a license from the Central Bank to effect transactions in the free market. Prescription of Currency In practice, nearly all exchange transactions in Costa Rica are expressed in U.S. dollars. Payments to Poland may be made through special U.S. dollar accounts established under a payments agreement with that country. Payments to £1 Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua in respect of trade and trade-related invisibles, if eligible for the official rate, may be made in Costa Rican colones through the Camara de Compensacion Centroamericana; the documents must be expressed in colones and require approval by the Central Bank. The central banks of these four countries may also convert Costa Rican notes and coins, up to the equiva- lent of US$10,000 a month for Nicaragua and up to the equivalent of US$5,000 a month for each of the other countries. Payments to Mexico in respect of trade and invisi- bles may also be made in Costa Rican colones through the clearinghouse, in accordance with the Agreement on Gearing and Reciprocal Credits between the Bank of Mexico and the member banks of the clearinghouse; the documents must be expressed in colones and require the prior approval of the Central Bank. There are no special arrangements with Mexico for the conversion of Costa Rican notes and coins. Imports and Import Payments There is no import licensing and all import payments may be made freely. However, certain imports from CACM countries require prior authorization, and imports made on a barter basis require a barter license (licencia de trueque) is- sued by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Imports from South Africa are prohibited in principle. Exchange at the official rate is granted for the c.i.f. value of specified essential imports, regardless of origin; for all imports registered at the Central Bank for the purchase of official exchange before October 23,1972 (including goods of Central American origin); for goods imported prior to June 19,1971; for commitments undertaken prior to June 19,1971 with bona fide financial institutions abroad; and for payments of letters of credit issued prior to June 19, 1971 for goods not shipped by that date. Capital goods are eligible for official exchange only if certain external financing requirements are ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution met. All other imports pass through the free market. How- ever, some goods that are otherwise payable at the free mar- ket rate are eligible for the official rate when imported from CACM countries or Panama. To be eligible for foreign exchange from the official market, imports must be registered with the Central Bank within 60 days of arrival at a national port. This registration serves as an application for official exchange. In principle, the Central Bank grants authorization to purchase foreign exchange at the time of registration; delays may occur, however, except in respect of imports from CACM countries. In addition to any applicable customs duty, there are levied on imports (1) a stamp tax of 3 per cent of the customs du ty on commodities not covered by the common external tariff of the CACM; (2) a sales tax of 5 per cent ad valorem, from which certain essential items are exempt; and (3) a selective consumption tax with a range of 10-50 per cent ad valorem on imports from outside the CACM and at lower rates on CACM imports. There also exists a small consular tax on certain imports. Furthermore, most imports originating out- side the CACM are subject to an import surcharge of 30 per cent of the applicable import duty. Payments for In visibles Payments for invisibles may be made freely through the free market. Exchange at the official rate is only granted for freight and insurance on imports effected at the official rate; for dividends and interest on registered foreign capital; indis- pensable payments of the Central Government; normal ex- penses in foreign currency on export transactions settled through the official market; student remittances; royalties; and insurance and reinsurance premiums, provided a com- mitment is given that any receipts from indemnities will be sold in the official market. Allocations of exchange at the official rate for interest and dividends are, in principle, made on the basis of 10 per cent of the registered capital, while the balance may be settled through the free market; in practice, allocations are granted on the merits of the case. Taxes of 15 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively, are levied on remit- tances abroad of dividends and interest; interest on certain borrowing abroad (e.g., from government banks) is exempt. Residents traveling abroad by air must pay a travel tax of 5 per cent of the value of the tickets plus 0 20 a trip; govern- ment officials, diplomats, minors, and students are exempt. Exports and Export Proceeds The Central Bank supervises exports to ensure that ex- change proceeds are surrendered as prescribed. Surrender must take place in the official exchange market, with the following exceptions: the exchange proceeds may be sold in the free market up to 50 per cent for nontraditional exports; up to 39 per cent for bananas produced by independent local growers; up to 5 per cent for coffee, if the coffee exporter incurs promotional expenditures abroad; up to 50 per cent of value added for exports of re-export industries; and up to 50 per cent of value added for exports outside the CACM of products incorporating inputs financed at the official rate. Some of these mixing rates are applicable only to exports to COSTA RICA countries outside Central America. Furthermore, nontradi- tional exports are entitled to tax credit certificates (CATs) corresponding to 15 per cent of the f.o.b. value. Licenses from the Central Bank are necessary for the ex- portation of merchandise. In addition to the export license from the Central Bank, other export licenses are required as follows: strategic materials, such as armaments, munitions, scrap iron, and scraps of nonferrous base metals (from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce); sugar (from the Minis- try of Industry and Commerce, so that shipments under the sugar quotas may be controlled); lumber and root of ipecacu- anha (from the Institute for Lands and Colonization); beans, rice, potatoes, onions, cotton, meat, and purebred and other cattle (from the National Council of Production); airplanes (from the Civil Aviation Board); Indian art objects made of gold, stone, or clay (from the National Museum); tobacco (from the Tobacco Defense Board); certain livestock and ani- mals and plants of forest origin (from the Ministry of Agricul- ture and Livestock); and coffee (from the Coffee Office); in addition, when there is a lien on the coffee in favor of a bank, that bank's approval is required before the Central Bank grants an export license. Exports to South Africa are prohib- ited in principle. The exchange proceeds of all exports must be surrendered within 60 days of exportation or, if the goods were sold on credit, upon expiry of the term of the credit. Foreign-owned banana companies that have contracts with the Government must surrender their net export proceeds, which are calcu- lated by deducting from their gross export proceeds (1) prof- its obtained during the year from their transactions in Costa Rica; (2) the allowance for depreciation on their investment in Costa Rica that is acceptable to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service; (3) the export tax on bananas payable in foreign currency; and (4) the cost of imports made during the year that were necessary for their normal business in Costa Rica. There are export taxes on bananas, sugar, and coffee. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles must be surrendered at the official rate within 60 days of accrual, with the exception of the following, which may be retained or sold in the free market: diplomatic and similar salaries and expenses; tourist expenditure; family remittances and other personal remit- tances; settlements on insurance claims, provided that the premium was paid through the free market; and commissions received by agents of foreign firms. Capital Inward and outward transfers of capital may be made freely through the free market by residents and nonresidents. The Charter of the Central Bank provides that foreign capital entering through the official market may be registered with the Central Bank in order to be ensured access to that market for the transfer of interest, profits, and amortization. Private capital outflows may be effected through the official market only if so registered. Incoming capital may be sold freely in the free market if it is foreign capital that did not elect regis- tration and surrender at the official rate or if it is national 121 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution COSTA RICA capital returning from abroad. The only outward transfers of capital permitted to be made at the official rate are repay- ments on certain private and public debts and certain amorti- zation on registered foreign capital. Registration is mandatory only for public sector borrowing abroad and for government-guaranteed borrowing abroad. Gold The Central Bank may purchase, sell, or hold gold coins or bars as part of the nation's monetary reserves in accor- dance with regulations established by its own Board. Private physical and juridical persons may negotiate freely, at home or abroad, domestically produced gold (except national ar- chaeological treasures), provided there is no infraction of international agreements. They may also hold gold in any form in Costa Rica. The Central Bank does not supply gold to artistic or professional users. Changes during 1973 During the year, on a number of occasions, payments for selected imports from the CACM countries and Panama were shifted back from the free market to the official market. Also, there were several additions to the List of Essential Import Goods; these involved basic commodities such as industrial raw materials, irrespective of origin. January 26. It was decided to transfer foreign exchange from the free market to the official market in February 1973 in order to speed up payment authorizations for imports eligible for the official rate. Such transfers were made on February 15, March 6, June 5, July 24, August 4, Novem- ber 21, and December 7. February 16. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were maintained unchanged in both exchange markets. March 3. Legislative Decree No. 5188 was published, which changed the gold parity of the colon from 0.123549 gram of tine gold to 0.111194 gram of tine gold. It came into effect on October 16. The new par value had not been agreed with the International Monetary Fund. March 14. Import duties became payable on the basis of the exchange rate applicable to the import transaction. Previ- ously, all import duties were based on the official rate. March 20. In accordance with Article 10 of Law No. 5122 of November 16, 1972, which established the Costa Rican Development Corporation (CODESA), the Central Bank in- creased the selling rate in the official market to £ 6.68 per US$1 (previously £ 6.65 per US$1) and reduced the buying rate in the free market to £ 8.54 per US$1 (previously £ 8.57 per US$1). The resulting exchange differential of £ 0.03 per US$1 was earmarked to cover CODESA'S financial needs. April 12. Those industrial firms exporting outside the CACM that had previously been required to surrender their export proceeds in the official market in exchange for the privilege of importing their raw material inputs at the official rate, were permitted to sell 50 per cent of the exchange pro- ceeds in the free market. 122 April 14. Decree No. 2932-MEIC of April 5, 1973 was published, implementing the Export Promotion Law (Law No. 5162 of December 22,1972). The Decree provided for the granting of tax credit certificates (CATs). The value of such certificates would be equivalent to 15 per cent of the amount in colones obtained by surrender to the Central Bank of the exchange proceeds from nontraditional exports. April 26. Fifty per cent of the proceeds from nontraditional exports of agricultural, livestock, and fishing products (ex- cept those in the List of Essential Imports) could henceforth be sold in the free market, but only when the goods were sold outside Central America. The remaining 50 per cent had to be surrendered at the official rate. April 26. Re-export industries ("drawback industries") were permitted to sell in the free market 50 per cent of the value added that was included in their export proceeds. May 24. The Charter of the Central Bank was amended by the modification of Articles 93, 96, and 102, and the elimina- tion of Article 94. The new Article 102 provided that private physical or juridical persons could sell domestically produced gold (except national archaeological treasures) at home or abroad, provided there was no infraction of international agreements. Sales abroad would be subject to such condi- tions as the Central Bank might establish. (Law No. 5199 of May 17,1973.) Previously, only the Central Bank was permit- ted to buy or sell gold and to import or export gold. May 25. A free trade agreement with Honduras was signed. It came into effect on June 7. May 31. Official exchange was provided to liquidate arrears on imports that had entered the country before June 19,1971. June 1. Importers entitled to official exchange who had made import payments through the free market before this date were entitled to receive the domestic currency equivalent of the difference between the two exchange rates. June 11. Decree No. 2926 prohibited finance companies from engaging in certain foreign trade operations that were henceforth reserved for commercial banks. June 21. An agreement between the central banks of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua was approved that regulated, through the intermediary of the Camara de Compensation Centroamericana, transactions in banknotes and other documents of countries maintaining ex- change restrictions. June 28. The release of up to US$15 million of official exchange was authorized for the settlement, in chronological order, of arrears on imports made after June 19, 1971. July 2. The Central Bank established regulations governing the granting by commercial banks of an "aval" or guarantee of payment to persons or firms abroad. These regulations were published in the Official Gazette on September 12. July 19. Thirty-nine per cent of the exchange proceeds from banana exports effected by local independent companies be- came eligible for sale in the free market; the remainder had to be surrendered in the official market. The arrangement was not applicable to foreign-owned banana producers. August 23. The Central Bank tightened the conditions on which official exchange could be made available for imports of capital goods. This action was based on changes made on the same date in Article 64 of the Regulations for the Appli- ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution cation of the Exchange System. The new text provided that the Central Bank could make exchange for capital goods available at the official rate when the imports were financed by international credit institutions, etc., or when the importer had obtained external financing for at least five years. In the latter case, the downpayment could not exceed 20 per cent, ^6 the remainder had to be settled in five annual or ten semiannual proportional installments, beginning one year af- ter the downpayment. August 30. Exchange up to US$500 a month was granted at the official rate for expenses of persons engaged in a profes- sjon ^d taking postgraduate courses abroad. COSTA RICA 123 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution CYPRUS Exchange Rate System The par value is 2.13281 grams of fine gold per Cyprus Pound, which corresponds to £C 0.416667 = SDR 1 or £C 0.345395 = US$1. No exchange transactions take place at the par value. The Central Bank quotes daily buying and selling rates for deutsche mark, Greek drachmas, pounds sterling, and U.S. dollars. The rate for the U.S. dollar on December 29, 1973 was US$2.7740 buying, and US$2.7710 selling, per £C 1, and that for sterling was £ stg. 1.2000 buying, and £ stg. 1.1950 selling, per £C 1. The Central Bank quotes indicative rates for a number of other currencies as well. Furthermore, the Central Bank offers authorized dealers facilities for forward purchases and sales of U.S. dollars and pounds sterling for periods of up to six months, in cover of trade transactions only. Administration of Control Exchange controls are administered by the Central Bank of Cyprus and trade controls by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Certain authority to approve applications for the allocation of foreign exchange within the scope of instructions issued by the Central Bank has been delegated to the autho- rized dealers. Authority to introduce, adapt, and supervise controls on exports of potatoes has been delegated to the Cyprus Potato Marketing Board, while exports of cereals are licensed by the Cyprus Grain Commission. proceeds from sales by nonresidents of any foreign currencya other than Rhodesian currency. External Accounts may be debited for payments to residents and nonresidents, for trans- fers to other External Accounts, and for purchases of any foreign currency other than Rhodesian currency. Rhodesian Accounts are held by residents of Rhodesia and are subject to separate rules. Blocked Accounts are maintained in the name of a nonresi- dent for certain funds of a capital nature which, under the existing exchange control regulations, may not be transferred outside Cyprus. Blocked funds may either be held as deposits or invested in government securities or government-guaran- teed securities. Income earned on blocked funds so invested may be remitted to the nonresident beneficiary or credited to an External Account without prior reference to the Central Bank. Funds can be released from Blocked Accounts in the following circumstances: On application by the authorized bank concerned acting on behalf of the nonresident account holder, the Central Bank may authorize the release of blocked funds for (1) reasonable educational expenses in Cyprus of the account holder's children; (2) reasonable living expenses of the account holder while on a visit to Cyprus; and (3) dona- tions to charitable institutions in Cyprus. In addition to any releases under (1), (2), and (3), amounts up to a level deter- mined from time to time may become eligible for release. At present, the Central Bank is prepared to permit the release to each nonresident holder of blocked funds of up to £C 5,000 in any calendar year. Prescription of Currency Imports and Import Payments Cyprus has ceased to be a Scheduled Territory in terms of the U.K. Exchange Control Act, 1947 but under current U.K. exchange control regulations continues to be regarded as a country of the Overseas Sterling Area. Settlements with clearing countries * must be made through the appropriate clearing account denominated either in pounds sterling or in U.S. dollars. Payments to countries other than the clearing countries (except Rhodesia) may be made by crediting Cy- prus pounds to an External Account, or in any foreign cur- rency other than Rhodesian currency; the proceeds of exports to such countries may be received in Cyprus pounds from an External Account or in any foreign currency except Rhode- sian currency. Settlements with Rhodesia are subject to spe- cial regulations; payments for exports to Rhodesia must be received in any foreign currency other than Rhodesian cur- rency. Nonresident Accounts Residents of countries outside Cyprus other than Rhodesia may maintain with authorized banks nonresident accounts in Cyprus pounds, designated External Accounts. These may be credited with authorized payments from residents of Cyprus, with transfers from other External Accounts, and with the All imports from Rhodesia and South Africa are prohib- ited. Imports of virtually all commodities may be made freely from any other country except Albania, Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Hungary, North Korea, Poland, Romania, Tibet, the U.S.S.R., and North Viet-Nam. For protective reasons, cer- tain goods (such as some agricultural and textile products, footwear, metal manufactures, and industrial machinery) may not be imported freely; for a few of these items, no licenses are granted, while for most of them licenses are granted liberally. Imports from Bulgaria, the People's Repub- lic of China, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the U.S.S.R. are licensed in accor- dance with the terms of bilateral trade and payments agree- ments. With respect to Albania, North Korea, Mongolia, Tibet, and North Viet-Nam, no formal trading arrangements exist but certain barter transactions take place from time to time. Individual import licenses are not required for bona fide unsolicited gifts (which may not be sold) up to £C 10 in value, for returned goods, or for certain special import transactions. Payments for all permitted imports may be made freely, but the authorized dealers' authority to effect payment with- out reference to the Central Bank is for advance payments in respect of imports limited to the equivalent of £C 100. 1 Bulgaria, People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and U.S.S.R. a Foreign currencies are all currencies other than Cyprus pounds. 124 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to nonresidents require the ap- proval of the exchange control authorities. Profits, dividends, and interest from approved foreign investments may be trans- ferred abroad, after payment of any charges and taxes due. Insurance premiums due to foreign insurance companies are remittable after deduction of all expenses and contingencies in respect of any claims. Maintenance remittances are allowed on application accompanied by documentary evidence of hardship. For certain categories of payments, limits are im- posed, only for the purpose of preventing illicit capital out- flow. For study abroad, the lower limit is £C 700 a year, and the upper limit is EC 2,200 a year; the amount allowed de- pends on the cost of living in the country concerned—e.g., for study in countries in the Middle East (defined as Egypt, Greece, Israel, Lebanon, and Turkey), £C 700; in the United States and Canada, £C 2,200; in other countries, £C 1,400. Higher amounts for student allowances may be granted on presentation of documentary evidence. For tourist travel, the limit is £C 350 a person annually; for business travel £C 20 to £C 40 a day is granted in addition to the tourist allowance. The basic tourist allowance is not available for travel to Rho- desia. Resident travelers may take out Cyprus notes up to £C 10 and foreign currency notes up to the equivalent of £C 50, the latter as part of their annual basic travel allowance. Nonresident travelers may take out £C 10 in Cyprus notes and any amount of foreign currency notes that they brought into Cyprus. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of potatoes are subject to control by the Cyprus Potato Marketing Board, and those of wheat and barley to control by the Cyprus Grain Commission. All exports are subject to licensing when the f.o.b. value exceeds £C 75 to ensure repatriation of the sales proceeds in an appropriate manner (see section on Prescription of Currency, above). Ex- port proceeds in all currencies must be surrendered within one month of receipt. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in all currencies must be sold to an authorized bank within one month of receipt. Persons enter- ing Cyprus may bring in any amount in foreign currency notes and Cyprus currency notes. Capital Exchange control is exercised over all capital receipts or payments. Capital receipts must be offered for sale to an authorized dealer; payments of a capital nature to any desti- nation require prior approval. Foreign investments in Cyprus by nonresidents require the prior approval of the exchange control authorities. In consid- ering applications, due regard is given to the purpose of the investment, the extent of possible foreign exchange savings, the number of persons to be employed, the extent of the CYPRUS foreign exchange liability which might arise from the invest- ment, and possible competition with existing industries. Pro- ceeds from the liquidation of approved foreign investments may be repatriated in full at any time, after payment of any charges and taxes due. Foreign nationals who repatriate or take up residence out- side Cyprus, and Cypriots who emigrate, may transfer abroad up to £C 10,000. Any excess amount is deposited in a Blocked Account. Transactions in foreign securities owned by residents re- quire prior permission from the authorities. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Cyprus for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities, authorized dealers in gold, and industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Authorized dealers in gold are permitted to import gold only for the purpose of disposing of it to industrial users. The export of gold requires the permission of the exchange control authori- ties. Changes during 1973 January 1. The Central Bank began offering facilities for forward purchases and sales of U.S. dollars and pounds ster- ling for periods of up to six months. February 16. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Cyprus maintained the par value of its currency in terms of gold. The effective parity relation- ship for the U.S. dollar, previously £C 0.383772, became £C 0.345395 = US$1. The Central Bank announced new buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar of US$2.8360 and US$2.8390, respectively, per £C 1. May 1. Releases of balances in Blocked Accounts were increased from £C 1,000 to £C 5,000 for each holder in each calendar year. May 1. The amount that foreign nationals who repatriate or take up residence outside Cyprus could transfer abroad was increased from £C 5,000 to £C 10,000. June 1. The agreement of association with the EEC came into effect. July 9. The authorities ceased for the time being to ensure that the rates for the Cyprus pound would be confined within the margins hitherto observed. As a result, the currency ap- preciated in terms of the U.S. dollar. Reasonable stability would be maintained with regard to the value of the Cyprus pound in terms of the currencies of Cyprus' major trading partners. July 23. The Central Bank began to quote spot and forward rates for the deutsche mark, in addition to the rates already quoted for the U.S. dollar and the pound sterling. September 79. A bilateral trade and payments agreement was concluded with the People's Republic of China. It came into effect immediately. October 15. The Central Bank began to quote the Greek drachma. 125 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution DAHOMEY Exchange System No par value for the currency of Dahomey has been established with the Fund. The unit of currency is the CFA Franc ,l which is officially maintained at the rate of CFAF 1 = 0.02 French franc. Exchange transactions in French francs, the intervention currency, between the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de 1'Ouest (BCEAO) and commercial banks take place at the rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02, free of commission. Exchange transactions relating to foreign countries, i.e., countries other than France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories other than the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries of the French Franc Area, take place in a dual exchange market at rates based on the fixed rate for the French franc and the Paris exchange rate for the foreign currency concerned in either the official exchange market or the financial franc market. Settlements eligible for the official exchange market are payments and receipts in respect of imports, exports, and most other current payments, as well as all current payments by or in favor of domestic and foreign public authorities and public bodies. All other settlements with foreign countries, as well as transactions in banknotes of foreign countries and banknotes issued by the BCEAO, take place through the financial franc market at freely fluctu- ating rates. The principal current payments and receipts channeled through the financial franc market are those relat- ing to travel expenses, capital earnings, and workers' remit- tances. Exchange rates for certain European currencies in the official market are based on par values and central rates; the effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar in this market is not confined within any announced margins. With the exception of those relating to gold, Dahomey's exchange control measures do not apply to (1) France (as defined above) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Opera- tions Account (Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the People's Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Togo, and Upper Volta). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries, except Dahomey itself, are considered foreign countries, and in principle financial relations only with for- eign countries are subject to exchange control. For purposes of certain capital controls, however, the countries specified in this paragraph are also considered foreign countries. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Directorate-Gen- eral of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Economy and Finance, which also supervises borrowing abroad, the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Daho- mey, inward direct investment, all investment in foreign countries, and the solicitation of funds in Dahomey for place- 1 The CFA franc is issued by the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de 1'Ouest (BCEAO) and is the common currency in Dahomey, Ivory Coast, Niger, Senegal, Togo, and Upper Volta. 126 ment in foreign countries. The BCEAO is authorized to col- lect (either direct or through the intermediary of banks, finan- cial institutions, the Postal Administration, and notaries public), any information necessary to compile the balance of payments statistics. All exchange transactions relating to for- eign countries must be effected through authorized intermedi- aries. Import licenses are issued by the Directorate-General of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Economy and Fi- nance. Exports of diamonds and other precious or semipre- cious materials require prior approval granted by a decree issued by the Council of Ministers. There are three special offices for the import and export of precious metals and pre- cious mineral materials, but these are inoperative. Import certificates for liberalized commodities originating in OECD countries other than Japan are made out by the importer himself and approved by the Directorate-General of Eco- nomic Affairs. Prescription of Currency Dahomey is an Operations Account country of the French Franc Area, since the BCEAO maintains an Operations Ac- count with the French Treasury; settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the other Operations Account countries of the French Franc Area are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other Operations Ac- count country. Settlements with all other countries are usu- ally made through correspondent banks in France in any of the currencies of those countries or in French francs through Foreign or Financial Accounts in Francs. Certain settlements with the People's Republic of China and Ghana, however, are made through special accounts. 2 All settlements with Portu- gal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. The crediting to nonresi- dent accounts of CFA banknotes, French banknotes, or banknotes issued by any other institute of issue that main- tains an Operations Account with the French Treasury is not permitted, except for BCEAO banknotes mailed direct to the BCEAO agency in Cotonou by authorized banks' foreign correspondents for credit to the accounts opened for the latter by authorized banks. Imports and Import Payments All imports originating in or shipped from Portugal, Rho- desia, or South Africa are prohibited. Certain imports, such as narcotics, are prohibited from all sources. The Societe de Commercialisation et de Credit Agricole du Dahomey (SOCAD) has a monopoly over the importation of sugar, rice, wheat, wheat flour, and condensed milk. Imports of all other goods originating in countries in the French Franc Area may be made freely without an import license. Imports of all other 3 There are inoperative payments agreements with Eastern Germany, Egypt, and Hungary. The agreement with Eastern Germany has never been ratified. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution goods originating in EEC countries other than France may also be made freely; these goods require a license, which is issued automatically. Certain imports are liberalized when originating in OECD countries other than Japan and only require an import certificate made out by the importer him- self. Imports of nonliberalized commodities originating in OECD countries, all imports originating in Japan, and all imports originating in non-OECD countries are subject to licensing; they are admitted in accordance with an annual import program, which is determined each year in a French-Dahomean Committee, in which both countries have equal status, as provided for by the Economic Cooperation Agreement with France. Under this program, a global quota is established for imports from all countries outside the French Franc Area except EEC countries. Certain French textiles processed in foreign countries are licensed separately. All imports originating in foreign countries, when valued at more than CFAF 500,000, must be domiciled with an authorized bank. The import licenses or import certificates entitle importers to purchase the necessary exchange, but not earlier than eight days before shipment if a documentary credit is opened or one month before the payment is due if the commodities have already been imported. Payments for Invisibles Payments to Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to the approval of the Directorate-Gen- eral of Economic Affairs, but for many types of invisibles the approval authority has been delegated to authorized banks. Authorized banks and the Postal Administration have been empowered to make transfers abroad freely on behalf of resi- dents, up to CFAF 50,000 a transfer. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authoriza- tion. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted. For tourist travel, residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the other Oper- ations Account countries of the French Franc Area may obtain an exchange allocation of an amount equivalent to CFAF 175,000 a trip for each person (CFAF 87,500 for chil- dren under ten) for any number of trips a year; any foreign exchange in excess of the equivalent of CFAF 5,000 remain- ing af ter return to Dahomey must be surrendered. For busi- ness travel there is a special allocation of the equivalent of CFAF 20,000 a day, subject to a maximum of CFAF 400,000 a trip. The transfer of the entire net salary of a foreigner working in Dahomey is permitted upon presentation of the appropri- ate pay voucher, provided that the transfer takes place within three months of the pay period. Travelers going to foreign countries may take out up to a maximum of CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO banknotes, French banknotes, and banknotes issued by other Operations Account countries. Resident travelers to other countries of the French Franc Area may take out any amount in BCEAO banknotes, but if going to a country that DAHOMEY is not a member of the West African Monetary Union they must declare to the customs the amount taken out if it exceeds CFAF 150,000. Nonresident travelers may take out any unutilized foreign banknotes and coins up to the amount declared by them on entry subject to adjustment for amounts exchanged for CFA francs or obtained by exchange of foreign currency. Non- resident travelers may take out freely the equivalent of CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO banknotes, French banknotes, and banknotes issued by Operations Account countries; the equivalent of CFAF 25,000 in foreign banknotes; and any amount in other foreign means of payment (travelers checks, etc.) established abroad in their names. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. Exports to all foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank when valued at CFAF 500,000 or more. Exports to all countries are free of license, except those of gold and diamonds, but require an export application vi- saed by the Directorate-General of Economic Affairs. Export proceeds received in currencies other than those of France or another Operations Account country must normally be col- lected within 180 days of the arrival of the commodities at their destination and surrendered by sale on the official ex- change market within two months of collection. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services, and all income earned in those countries from for- eign assets, must be collected and surrendered. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank- notes and coins issued by the BCEAO, the Bank of France, or a bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bank- notes and coins (except gold coins) of countries outside the French Franc Area; resident travelers must within eight days of return surrender to an authorized bank any foreign bank- notes and foreign currency travelers checks in excess of CFAF 5,000 they bring in. Capital Transfers of capital between Dahomey and Portugal, Rho- desia, and South Africa are prohibited. Capital movements between Dahomey and France (as defined above), Monaco, and other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require exchange control approval and are re- stricted, but capital receipts from such countries are permit- ted freely. Special controls (additional to any exchange control re- quirements that may be applicable) are maintained over bor- rowing abroad, over inward foreign direct investment and all outward investment in foreign countries, and over the issuing, 127 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution DAHOMEY advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Daho- mey; these controls relate to the transactions themselves, not to payments or receipts. With the exception of those over foreign securities, these control measures do not apply to France (as defined above), Monaco, the other member countries of the West African Monetary Union, and those other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account. Special controls are maintained also over imports and exports of gold, over the soliciting of funds for deposit or investment with foreign private persons and foreign firms and institutions, and over all publicity aimed at placing funds abroad or at subscribing to real estate building operations abroad; these special con- trols do apply also to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries. All investments abroad by residents of Dahomey require prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Fi- nance. 3 Foreign direct investments in Dahomey 4 must be declared to the Minister of Economy and Finance before they are made. The Minister has a period of two months from receipt of the declaration during which he may request the postponement of the projects submitted to him. The full or partial liquidation of either type of investment also requires declaration. Both the making and the liquidation of invest- ments, whether these are Dahomean investments abroad or foreign investments in Dahomey, must be reported to the Minister of Economy and Finance and to the BCEAO within 20 days following each operation. Direct investments are de- fined as investments implying control of a company or enter- prise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 per cent in the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign secu- rities in Dahomey requires prior authorization by the Minis- ter of Economy and Finance. Exempt from authorization, however, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Dahomean Government, and (2) shares that are similar to or may be substituted for securities whose issuing, advertising, or offering for sale in Dahomey has previously been authorized. Borrowing by residents from nonresidents requires prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans constituting a direct investment, which are subject to prior declaration, as indicated above; (2) loans taken up by industrial firms to finance operations abroad, by interna- tional merchanting firms (approved by the Minister of Econ- omy and Finance) to finance transit trade, or by any type of firm to finance imports or exports; (3) loans contracted by authorized banks; and (4) subject to certain conditions, loans other than those mentioned above, when the total amount outstanding of these loans, including the new borrowing, does not exceed CFAF 50 million for any one borrower.

Lending abroad is subject to prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. The lending of CFA francs to nonresidents for periods of up to two years, how- ever, is freely permitted, subject to ex post reporting to the Directorate-General of Economic Affairs and to the BCEAO. The Investment Code (Ordinance No. 72-1 of January 8, 1972) provides for preferential status that may be granted to foreign and domestic investments in industry, mining, fisher- ies, agriculture, and tourism, when such investments are deemed to be of value to national development. Four prefer- ential regimes are established. Plan A is intended for medi- um-sized investments and provides for exemption, during a period of up to 5 years, from import duties and taxes on materials necessary for the production of the proposed prod- uct, and from certain other taxation. Plan B, for larger projects, is granted for a maximum period of 8 years and provides, in addition to the benefits of Plan A, certain other tax privileges. Plan Cis intended for enterprises undertaking to invest more than CFAF 500 million and is granted for a period of up to 15 years. In addition to the benefits of Plan B, Plan C guarantees stability of tax status, free choice of suppliers, and certain other advantages. Plan D provides cer- tain benefits for Dahomean entrepreneurs investing at least CFAF 10 million. The method of application of the Invest- ment Code is set out in Decree No. 72-7 of January 17, 1972. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Dahomey. 5 Imports and exports of gold from or to any other country require prior authorization by the Minis- ter of Economy and Finance, which is seldom granted. Ex- empt from this requirement are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the Treasury or the BCEAO; (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles); and (3) imports and exports by travelers of gold articles up to a maximum weight to be determined by an Order of the Minis- ter. Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Changes during 1973 January 29. The commissions levied by the BCEAO on transfers to France and other countries of the French Franc Area, except those of the West African Monetary Union, were made identical with those on transfers to countries out- side the French Franc Area. The unified commission was increased on July 2. February 7. Ordinance No. 73-11 obliged all industrial and commercial enterprises installed in Dahomey to domicile their head office in Dahomey and to conduct their accounts in Dahomey. 8 Prior authorization granted by a decree issued by the Council of Ministers acting on the advice of the Minister of Mines is required to hold, sell, import, export, or deal in, raw diamonds and precious or semiprecious materials. ©International Monetary Fund.

Not for Redistribution DENMARK 1 Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.118489 gram of fine gold per Danish Krone. A central rate has been established of DKr 6.28205 = US$1, corresponding to DKr 7.57831 = SDR 1, and Denmark avails itself of wider margins. Denmark maintains a maximum margin of 2.25 per cent for rates in spot exchange transactions in the official exchange market between the Dan- ish krone and the Belgian franc, the deutsche mark, the French franc, the Luxembourg franc, the Netherlands guil- der, the Norwegian krone, and the Swedish krona. 2 No an- nounced margins are maintained for any other currency. Market rates are quoted daily for the 16 currencies that are used most often. 3 On December 31, 1973, the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were DKr 6.2860 and DKr 6.2940, respectively, per US$1. Authorized exchange dealers may engage in arbitrage both spot and forward for up to 12 months with one another and with their foreign correspondents in all currencies, including Danish kroner. Special rules apply, however, for the forward sale of foreign currencies against Danish kroner to foreign correspondents. Forward premiums and discounts are gener- ally left to the interplay of market forces, but the central bank has from time to time sold U.S. dollars forward to authorized banks. Forward transactions with residents must cover con- tractual payments for goods and services or payments on authorized loans and credits, the payments covered being due not more than two years from the date of the forward con- tract. Denmark formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from May 1, 1967. Exchange Control Territory The Danish Monetary Area comprises Denmark, Green- land, and the Faroe Islands. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the National Bank of Denmark, which is the central exchange control authority. However, administrative powers for most payments and transfers are delegated to the authorized exchange dealers, i.e., banks and the stock exchange brokers who are members of the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. The exchange regula- tions generally do not apply to individual transactions and transfers of DKr 3,000 or less. Permission, when required, for foreign direct investments in Denmark has to be obtained from the Ministry of Commerce. Licenses for imports and exports, when required, are issued by the Ministry of Com- 1 In view of certain changes that took place on January 1, 1974 (see note at the end of this survey), this survey presents the position on that date. 2 With effect from January 19, 1974 these arrangements were suspended for the French franc. 3 Austrian schillings, Belgian (Luxembourg) francs, Canadian dollars, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Icelandic krdnur, Italian lire, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. 130 merce, the Ministry of Agriculture, or the Ministry of Fisher- ies. Prescription of Currency Payments to or from foreign countries may be made in any foreign currency or in Danish kroner. Virtually all payments in favor of residents of Rhodesia, however, must be credited to a South Rhodesian Account. Pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution No. 253 (1968), restrictions for security reasons are applied to virtu- ally all payments and transfers to, or for the benefit of, Rho- desia, and to certain receipts from Rhodesia. Nonresident Accounts Nonresident krone accounts are convertible. The only ex- ceptions are Emigrant Accounts and South Rhodesian Ac- counts. Krone Accounts may be opened by authorized banks for foreign banks, insurance companies, and shipping compa- nies, and for specified official institutions of the EEC. They may also be opened for other nonresidents, including persons who are or have been of Danish nationality, provided that the credit balance in any one account does not exceed DKr 75,000; any amounts in excess of DKr 75,000 must be transferred abroad within two days. Special accounts not subject to a maximum balance may be opened for nonresi- dents provided they are only credited with the liquidation proceeds or capital earnings from investments in Denmark and some other funds. Emigrant Accounts arc kept by authorized exchange dealers fpr holding capital, income from capital, pensions, and other funds owned by or accruing to Danish emigrants, to the extent that the amounts exceed the exchange allowance of DKr 40,000 available to each person at the time of departure. Certain payments to residents may be made freely from these accounts and the balances are in any case made convertible one year after departure. South Rhodesian Accounts are kept for residents of Rhode- sia; balances in these accounts are inconvertible. Imports and Import Payments Most commodities are liberalized and free of licensing from all sources. The only commodities that require a license when originating in or purchased from member countries of the EEC are a few agricultural products and unwrought and semimanufactured gold. A few items require a license when originating in Japan, the Republic of Korea, or any other non-state-trading, non-EEC country. A larger number of items require a license when originating in or purchased from Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Hun- gary, Poland, Romania, or the U.S.S.R. Special licensing pro- visions are in force for most items originating in or purchased from the People's Republic of China, the Republic of China, North Korea, Mongolia, or North Viet-Nam. No licenses are ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution granted for the importation of goods originating in or pur- chased in Rhodesia. With these exceptions, imports are free of license, provided that for Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the state trading countries the country of origin and the country of purchase are identical. The transfer of funds to, or for the benefit of, Rhodesia is prohibited. With this exception, payments for imports and the related shipping expenses may be made freely within five years from the end of the month in which the goods were cleared through customs, provided that repayments of debts are not made more than 30 days before the day stipulated as the latest in the contract (or before the latest customary date in the trade). However, commercial credits can be repaid at any time if any discount is obtained as a result, provided the payment is made to the supplier and conforms to normal commercial practice in the trade concerned. Prepayments linked to trade in goods and services that are in conformity with normal commercial practice for the particular line of business, may be granted to nonresidents up to one year prior to the expected date of import or the expected date of per- formance of the service; the permitted period is up to five years for capital goods (ships, aircraft, heavy machinery, and major installations) when purchased for an amount of DKr 1 million or more. All other advance payments for imports require prior approval by the National Bank. Payments for In visibles The National Bank has delegated to authorized exchange dealers the authority to permit payments by residents, includ- ing foreign nationals temporarily working in Denmark, for most invisibles to be made freely, provided that payments of debts are not made more than 30 days before the day stipu- lated as the latest in the contract (or before the latest custom- ary date in the trade); only in a few cases is approval from the National Bank required. Authorized banks are empowered to allow the transfer up to DKr 40,000 a person a year of foreign nationals' wages and salaries earned in Denmark, provided that the person concerned has not resided in Denmark for more than three years and the transfer is made to the remit- ter's own account abroad. Transfers of up to DKr 3,000 for any permitted purpose may be made without delivery of forms. Foreign exchange for travel is allocated freely and may be obtained for travel to any country, but not earlier than 30 days before the trip if the amount applied for exceeds the equivalent of DKr 3,000. Payments of any kind to Rhodesia, except payments for pensions, for strictly humanitarian, medical, or educational purposes, or for the purchase of news material, are prohib- ited. Travelers may take out freely DKr 3,000 in Danish bank- notes and coins, and any amount in foreign banknotes or other means of payment. Nonresidents may in addition ex- port any amount of Danish banknotes and coins derived from sales of foreign currency in Denmark or brought in by them when they entered Denmark. DENMARK Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Rhodesia are prohibited, with the exception of products intended for strictly medical purposes, educational material or other equipment for schools and the like, publica- tions, and news material. The only commodities that require a license when exported to member countries of the EEC are gold and waste and scrap of iron and steel. With respect to other destinations, except for certain items subject to strate- gic controls, export licenses are required only for waste and scrap of certain metals, crude oil and some oil products, and monetary gold and gold coins. Export proceeds must be transferred to Denmark without undue delay unless the National Bank permits otherwise. However, this obligation does not apply to amounts which are to be used within 30 days to settle or to offset the cost of certain commercial expenses. Foreign exchange receipts must be offered for sale to the National Bank or to an authorized exchange dealer without undue delay. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange derived from invisibles must be trans- ferred to Denmark, unless the National Bank permits other- wise, and offered for sale to the Bank or to an authorized exchange dealer without undue delay, with exceptions similar to those that apply to export proceeds (see section on Exports and Export Proceeds, above). Travelers may bring in any amount of Danish banknotes and coins, foreign banknotes, and other Danish or foreign means of payment. Capital Both inward and outward transfers of capital and all bor- rowing and lending between residents and nonresidents are subject to exchange control and may be restricted. Licensing practice vis-a-vis residents of member countries of the EEC is based on the rules of the EEC's directives on capital move- ments, subject to certain transitional arrangements, and li- censing practice in respect of residents of the rest of the world (except Rhodesia) as a rule is similar. Residents have an obligation to repatriate proceeds realized from the sale or liquidation of assets abroad. Transfers abroad may be made by residents to pay inter- est on, or to redeem upon maturity, or to repurchase any Danish securities denominated exclusively in Danish kroner as well as the transferor's own bonds irrespective of denomi- nation (provided these bonds are quoted on an authorized stock exchange abroad), to lend amounts not exceeding DKr 200,000 in a calendar year to subsidiary companies, branches, and so for th, or to a member of the resident's family, and to buy foreign securities that do not represent direct investments in foreign commercial or industrial enter- prises, provided that the securities are acquired on the basis of a subscription right to shares or the like owned by the resident concerned or provided that the resident furnishes proof that he has repatriated a corresponding amount within 131 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution DENMARK the last 12 months from the sale of foreign securities to a nonresident. No special permission is required for residents to make transfers abroad, within certain limits, in connection with direct investments in most industries (equity capital or loan capital) or with the private acquisition of real estate abroad. The limits are DKr 100,000 a year for each foreign enterprise for direct investments of equity capital, DKr 200,000 for direct investments of loan capital, and DKr 60,000 a person for private acquisition of real estate for noncommercial pur- poses. Direct investments abroad by residents are normally approved in accordance with Denmark's obligations as a member of the EEC and the OECD. The private acquisition of real estate in excess of DKr 60,000 normally is approved in accordance with Denmark's obligation as a member of the EEC. Loans and credits granted by exporters or banks and made in connection with the sale of goods or services are normally permitted for up to five years. Permission from the National Bank is required for most other transfers abroad of a capital nature by residents. Portfolio investment abroad is generally not allowed. Danish emigrants are granted an exchange allowance of up to DKr 40,000 for each person at the time of departure. Funds exceeding these amounts must be credited to an Emi- grant Account in the name of the owner and may be trans- ferred abroad one year after departure, or earlier if the emigrant can show that he has taken up permanent residence abroad with the approval of the relevant foreign authorities. Inward direct investment in the form of equity capital may be made without any special license if the investment con- cerns industry, trade in goods, handicrafts, the hotel business, travel agencies, or transportation, and if the investment does not increase total direct foreign investment in the enterprise concerned by more than DKr 100,000 in each calendar year. Inward direct investments with loan capital also are exempt from special license within certain limits. Other direct invest- ment by nonresidents requires permission from the exchange control authorities, which is granted liberally in accordance with Denmark's obligations as a member of the EEC and the OECD. The purchase by a nonresident of real property in Denmark usually requires a special license from the Ministry of Justice; permission is usually granted readily where real estate is to be used for industrial or similar enterprises. Nonresidents may purchase or subscribe to bonds that are quoted on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange and are expressed solely in Danish kroner, when the funds have been obtained from the liquidation of investments in Denmark (other than Danish shares representing portfolio investments), or from specified types of income accruing in Denmark; within certain limits, foreign insurance companies may purchase such bonds without any corresponding restrictions on the origin of the funds. Moreover, the sale to nonresidents (including persons who are or have been Danish nationals) of Danish bonds expressed solely in Danish kroner and listed on the Copenha- gen Stock Exchange is freely permitted within a periodically established quota, provided that sales are effected for the account of the National Bank of Denmark. Such bonds may be resold to residents and the proceeds of resale are transfer- able or may be reinvested, within a short period, by purchase 132 of, or subscription to, Danish bonds. Nonresidents may freely purchase or subscribe to shares that are quoted on the Copen- hagen Stock Exchange, provided the purchase does not repre- sent a direct investment and is not being made with a view to subsequent direct investment in the company concerned; this liberalization does not apply to certificates of investment companies, etc., whose latest balance sheet shows more than 10 per cent of their assets placed in Danish bonds, deben- tures, and mortgage deeds. Nonresidents may freely grant credits for up to five years to residents to finance purchases of commodities and services abroad and to finance the granting of credits for exports of commodities and services, provided the credit is in confor- mity with commercial practice in the trade concerned. They may, further, grant loans of up to DKr 5 million a borrower in a calendar year to enterprises in most industries, provided that the maturity is at least five years and that the entire proceeds are used only to finance expenditure made within six months prior to the date the loan is contracted or to be made within six months following that date, for the establish- ment, expansion, or equipment of the borrower's own busi- ness and /or industrial premises and for the acquisition of plant, machinery, and transport equipment to be used for its own business and /or industrial activities. Finally, they may grant loans up to DKr 200,000 a borrower in a calendar year to members of the nonresident's family. Municipalities and public utility companies may as a rule issue debenture loans abroad without special permission of the National Bank, but their foreign borrowing is subject to control by the competent executive department of the Gov- ernment. Transfers of proceeds from the sale or liquidation of all types of investments and transfers of all other liquid funds in Denmark owned by nonresidents other than newly emigrated persons are permitted freely, irrespective of when and how the original investment was acquired. Interest and repayment of principal on authorized loans, credits, and deposits received from persons and firms who are nonresidents at the time of receipt may be paid freely, with the proviso that loans and credits obtained from a nonresident generally must not be amortized or repaid in full more than 30 days before the amortization payment or repayment is due, or before the customary date in the trade. Inheritances and gifts to relatives may normally be trans- ferred to any country without limitation. Individual pay- ments above DKr 3,000 as gifts to persons other than relatives require approval from the National Bank. Such ap- proval is normally given for bona fide gifts. Imports and exports of securities are subject to regulations, the details of which are established by the National Bank. Bona fide imports of Danish securities payable only in Danish kroner are permitted. Exports of Danish and foreign securi- ties owned by nonresidents are normally permitted also. Dan- ish securities held in Denmark and belonging to nonresidents may, with the principal exception of securities denominated wholly or partly in foreign currencies, be sold freely to resi- dents. Foreign securities held in Denmark and belonging to nonresidents may, with certain exceptions, be sold to resi- ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution dents only with the permission of the National Bank. Foreign securities held in Denmark may be negotiated freely between residents, provided that the exchange control regulations are not circumvented. The net "commercial" foreign position of authorized for- eign exchange dealers is subject to limitation. For any indi- vidual bank, this position must not be negative, except in accordance with the following. For all banks collectively, a quota has been set (DKr 250 million for 1974) up to which they may incur a negative net "commercial" foreign position, insofar as this results from the taking up of foreign currency loans and credits for purposes of on-lending in foreign cur- rency to customers in order to finance Danish foreign trade. The largest exchange dealers have been allocated subquotas, and for the others there is a residual subquota of DKr 9 million. A positive net "commercial" foreign position is in principle allowed only as long as it does not exceed the higher of the following amounts—DKr 2 million or 15 per cent of the capital and reserves of the individual bank concerned. The National Bank has granted a number of exemptions from this rule. Bank advances to customers financed by foreign credit taken up under these quota arrangements are exempt from the credit ceiling to which the bank concerned is subject. Such advances to customers must be used only for purposes per- mitted by the exchange control regulations. Gold Residents may freely buy, hold, and sell gold coins in Denmark; they may also import gold coins from most non-state-trading countries. Otherwise, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to acquire gold abroad. Imports and exports of gold normally require licenses issued by the Ministry of Com- merce; such licenses are not normally granted except for im- ports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users, or exports to EEC countries of gold coins. Imports of gold in bars or coins, unless made by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, are subject to value-added tax at a rate of 15 per cent but not to customs duty. Domestic transactions also are taxed at a rate of 15 per cent. Changes during 1973 January 1. Denmark became a member of the EEC. January 1. Portfolio investment by nonresidents in Danish shares quoted on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange was liber- alized. The only exception was that with respect to certificates issued by investment associations and investment companies, this liberalization did not apply to those whose latest balance sheet showed more than 10 per cent of their assets placed in Danish bonds, debentures, and mortgage deeds. Before the purchase or subscription was effected, the nonresident acqui- rer was required to submit a declaration to the National Bank to the effect that the purchase or subscription would not result in a direct investment in Denmark and that it was not being made with a view to subsequent direct investment in the company concerned. The sales proceeds of Danish shares acquired by nonresidents were transferable abroad and hence DENMARK were in effect available also for the purchase of krone bonds by nonresidents. Sales of krone bonds to nonresidents remained subject to existing arrangements, but the special agent commission on such sales was canceled; the quota for the first six months of 1973 was fixed at DKr 125 million. January 1. The ceiling on residents' purchases of real es- tate abroad for noncommercial purposes was raised from DKr 40,000 to DKr 60,000 a person. Furthermore, applica- tions for higher amounts could generally be expected to be granted, but only for property situated in a member country of the EEC. January 1. Licensing practice under the existing exchange control regulations would henceforth be based on the rules of the EEC's directives on capital movements, subject to the transitional arrangements agreed with Denmark on inward and outward portfolio investment. January 1. The rules governing the net "commercial" for- eign position of authorized foreign exchange dealers were modified. Since December 1, 1971, these rules had provided that the position of each bank must at all times be at least zero and at most DKr 2 million, although a bank could at any given moment have a net "commercial" foreign position equal to 15 per cent of its share capital plus reserves. While the rule regarding the positive position remained unchanged, an indi- vidual bank's position henceforth could be negative in accor- dance with the following rule. For all banks collectively, a quota was set (DKr 250 million for 1973) up to which they could incur a negative net "commercial" foreign position, insofar as this resulted from the taking up of foreign currency loans and credits for purposes of on-lending in foreign cur- rency to customers in order to finance Danish foreign trade. The largest exchange dealers were allocated subquotas, and for the others there was a residual subquota of DKr 50 mil- lion. January L The right of expatriate Danes to make payments from abroad into their krone accounts was limited. Also, the rules governing the maximum balance in krone accounts maintained by nonresidents other than foreign banks, ship- ping lines, and insurance companies were amended so that the credit balance in any one account could not exceed DKr 75,000 unless the amount concerned was held as of Sep- tember 30, 1972 or stemmed from the subsequent liquidation of the account holder's capital investments or similar assets in Denmark. Existing individual exemptions from the rules on maximum balances in convertible krone accounts re- mained in force until further notice but would be reviewed by the National Bank. January 1. The temporary import surcharge was further reduced from 7 per cent to 4 per cent. January 1. An internal consumption tax was imposed on coffee to cover the difference between the previous import duty on coffee and the new customs duty imposed under the common external tariff of the EEC. February 1. A substantial overall liberalization of trade controls took place with the first commercial policy measures taken in compliance with EEC membership commitments. Licenses for imports from EEC countries henceforth were required only for a few agricultural products, ethyl alcohol, 133 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution DENMARK and gold (unwrought and semimanufactured, except gold leaf and gold foil). Licenses for exports to EEC countries were required only for waste and scrap of iron and steel and for monetary gold. The special arrangements agreed with the United Kingdom for Danish exports of bacon, poultry, and cheese lapsed and the levies on exports of pigs and pork to other EEC countries were terminated. The first tariff adjust- ments toward the elimination of import duties on intra-EEC trade and toward alignment on the common external tariff of the EEC took place. February 12. The exchange market was closed. It reopened on February 15. February 15. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Denmark maintained the value of the krone in terms of SDRs and the central rate, previously DKr 6.98 = US$1, became DKr 6.28205 = US$1. New upper and lower intervention rates for the U.S. dollar were set at DKr 6.4230 and DKr 6.1410, respectively. February 20. The reinvestment in Danish bonds of the proceeds from the sale of Danish shares representing portfo- lio investment by nonresidents was prohibited unless such reinvestment took place within the framework of the bond quota for nonresidents. March 2. The exchange market was closed. It reopened on March 19. March 14. Capital Accounts held by residents of Rhodesia were redesignated South Rhodesian Accounts. The remaining Capital Accounts were redesignated Emigrant Accounts. Foreign Accounts, i.e., nonresident accounts with savings banks and small cooperative banks, were redesignated Krone Accounts, these banks now being given full authorized bank status. Convertible Krone Accounts of nonresidents other than foreign correspondents, shipowners, and insurance com- panies were subdivided into O Accounts and M Accounts, with balances in the latter subject to ceilings. March 19. The official limits for the U.S. dollar were sus- pended. Denmark maintained a maximum margin of 2.25 per cent for rates in spot exchange transactions in its official market between the Danish krone and the Belgian franc, the deutsche mark, the French franc, the Luxembourg franc, the Netherlands guilder, and the Norwegian krone. On the same date, these arrangements were extended to include the Swed- ish krona. No announced margins were maintained for any other currency. March 19. A complete revision of the foreign exchange regulations came into force. Administrative practices were modified. The principal new measures were the following: (1) The foreign exchange regulations generally would not apply to individual transactions or transfers of DKr 3,000 or less. This provision replaced a large number of exemp- tions from the previous rules governing amounts of up to DKr 2,000. (2) The provisions on direct investments were relaxed and the scope for the granting of licenses upon verification was widened. Henceforth no permit was required for either Dan- ish direct investments abroad or foreign direct investments in Denmark in industry, trade in goods, or certain services, provided that such investments did not exceed DKr 100,000 a calendar year (previously DKr 40,000 a calendar year). 134 Subject to special rules, Danish direct investments abroad could be refinanced with loans taken up abroad with a matu- rity of at least five years. Subsidies granted by parent compa- nies to branches henceforth were treated as direct investments. (3) The purchase by nonresidents of Danish shares for portfolio investment was fully liberalized, provided the shares were quoted on a recognized security market. This liberaliza- tion henceforth also extended to Danish shares denominated in foreign currency and to shares and certificates issued by investment companies, provided their latest balance sheet showed that not more than 10 per cent of their assets con- sisted of Danish bonds, debentures, and mortgage deeds. (4) The issue of shares and certificates abroad by residents was partially liberalized, in the sense that the securities could be purchased by nonresidents for portfolio investment in con- formity with the provisions under 3, above. (5) The rules governing the purchase by nonresidents of Danish bonds quoted on a recognized security market were eased. The purchase by nonresidents of bonds denominated wholly or partly in foreign currency was liberalized. The quota system for the sale to nonresidents of bonds denomi- nated in Danish kroner was continued and expanded. Non- residents henceforth could within one year of accrual invest certain monies in bonds outside the quota system (liquidation proceeds of direct investments, inheritances, pensions, life and annuity insurance payments, and capital earnings from any of the foregoing). (6) The provisions according to which nonresidents who are or have been Danish nationals enjoyed special privileges with respect to the purchase of Danish securities were re- pealed. (7) The rules governing the taking up and granting of commercial credits, including prepayment and repayment, were relaxed so that fewer individual licenses were required. (8) The procedures governing the purchase or construction by residents of real estate abroad for nonbusiness purposes, and the acquisition of long-term leases on such property, were relaxed slightly in line with the January 1, 1973 liberalization measure. Such purchases no longer required an individual permit, provided the investment of each individual did not exceed DKr 60,000 (previously DKr 40,000). (9) Authorized exchange dealers could henceforth invest liquid funds in foreign currency certificates of deposit, subject to the rules already applicable to foreign treasury bills and bankers' acceptances; amounts serving to cover forward ex- change transactions now could be invested by banks for the full maturity of the forward contract. (10) A list of current transactions was drawn up. All other transactions would be regarded as capital transactions. April 1. The temporary import surcharge was abolished as scheduled. May 10. Certain imports from Albania, Bulgaria, Czecho- slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the U.S.S.R. were liberalized. Certain imports from the People's Republic of China also were liberalized. June 28. The quota for sales of krone bonds to nonresidents was fixed at DKr 75 million for the third quarter of 1973. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution September 15. Further imports from Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the U.S.S.R. were liberalized. September 27. The quota for sales of krone bonds to non- residents for the fourth quarter of 1973 was fixed at DKr 85 million. October 31. Further imports from Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the U.S.S.R. were liberalized. October 31. Exports of certain oil products to non-EEC countries were made subject to individual license, with the understanding that normal commercial relations would be taken into consideration. December 20. Agreement was reached between the Govern- ment and the National Bank to the effect that as soon as possible borrowing abroad by Danish firms should normally be confined to trade credit or credit to finance investments of a genuine commercial or industrial nature. NOTE.—The following changes took place on January 1, 1974: January 1. The rules governing the net "commercial" for- eign position of authorized foreign exchange dealers were continued unchanged. All banks collectively could incur a negative net "commercial" foreign position up to DKr 250 million, subject to the rules introduced on January 1, 1973. The quota for 1974 was divided into subquotas for the 26 largest exchange dealers and a residual quota of DKr 9 mil- lion for the others. January 1. The bilateral payments arrangement with East- ern Germany was discontinued and all payments between Denmark and Eastern Germany henceforth took place in DENMARK convertible currencies. The special East German Krone Ac- counts were redesignated convertible Krone Accounts. At the same time a comprehensive and reciprocal liberalization of trade between Denmark and Eastern Germany came into effect. January 1. Acting in concert with the central banks of the other EEC member countries, the National Bank eased the rules governing demand and time deposits on convertible Krone Accounts held by specified financial institutions of the EEC, as well as the rules concerning their investments in listed Danish krone bonds. January 1. The taking up of financial loans abroad, which had been permitted for certain categories of business firms since 1968, was made subject to more stringent conditions. Henceforth, such loans could generally be raised abroad only provided the entire proceeds were used exclusively to finance expenditures made within six months prior to the date of the loan transaction, or to be made under contractual obligations within six months following that date, for the establishment, extension, or equipment of the borrower's own business and /or industrial premises, and for the acquisition of plant, machinery, and transport equipment to be used for the bor- rower's own business and /or industrial activities. Every bor- rower was required to declare in writing that his prospective financial loan would meet these conditions. The maximum permitted amount remained unchanged at DKr 5 million a borrower a year. Special rules were applicable to financial loans raised by affiliates from their parent companies or vice versa, or from other affiliates of the same parent company. January 1. As the quota for the fourth quarter of 1973 for sales of krone bonds to nonresidents had not been taken up fully, the period within which that quota could be used was extended until further notice. January 1. Denmark's scheme of generalized tariff prefer- ences was superseded by the EEC scheme. 135 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution DOMINICAN REPUBLIC Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.736662 gram of fine gold per Dominican Peso, corresponding to RD$ 1.20635 = SDR 1 or RD$1 = US$1. The intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. Exchange transactions in U.S. dollars between the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic and other banks take place at RD$1 = US$1, plus a commission of l/32 of 1 per cent. Exchange transactions by commercial banks with the public also take place at the rate of RD$1 = US$1, subject to banking com- missions of % of 1 per cent buying and l/2 of 1 per cent selling. Different effective exchange rates may arise from the require- ment of a fully prepaid letter of credit for certain imports. With the exception of payments for imports made with the importer's own foreign exchange, all payments abroad must be made through banks, and all exchange received must be sold to banks. The commercial banks are required to transfer to the Central Bank all exchange purchased. There is a toler- ated parallel exchange market. On August 1, 1953, the Dominican Republic notified the Fund that it formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control Exchange and trade control policy is made by the Mone- tary Board. Foreign exchange control is administered by the Central Bank. The Monetary Board establishes import quo- tas, which are administered and controlled by the Foreign Exchange Department of the Central Bank. Prescription of Currency Imports from the United States that are financed by the U.S. Agency for International Development must be effected under special letters of credit. Certain import commissions must be paid in local currency only. Settlements with Colom- bia and Venezuela may be effected through special accounts established under reciprocal credit agreements;1 payments for oil imports, however, may not be made through these accounts. Import payments in currencies other than the U.S. dollar must be made through a letter of credit. Otherwise no obligations are imposed on importers, exporters, or other residents in respect of the method to be followed or the currency to be used for payments to or from nonresidents. Imports and Import Payments Imports of some 80 categories of goods, including automo- biles with an f.o.b. value in excess of RD$2,000, are prohib- ited. Imports of certain other commodities are restricted by quotas. All commodities are exempt from quota and prohibi- tion when they are financed with the importer's own foreign exchange; such imports are also exempt from prepayment of import taxes and surcharges. Licensing controls are main- tained over a few commodities, however, for reasons of health 1 Under these agreements, import collections and other payments to Colombia and Venezuela are settled promptly. 136 or security. The import controls involve exchange allocations. All payments for imports require the approval of the Central Bank, except those made with the importer's own exchange. Insurance on imports must be effected with companies autho- rized to operate in the Dominican Republic. Commodities subject to quantitative restrictions can be imported and settled with official exchange only against a fully prepaid letter of credit. The same requirement applies to some other goods that are not subject to quantitative restric- tions, including many types of smoked, dried, or canned fish, alcoholic beverages, Venetian blinds, some perfumes and cos- metics, electric ovens, freezers and refrigerators, record play- ers, and certain construction materials. Some 20 other import items not subject to restrictions must be covered by regular letters of credit. The commercial banks transmit to the Cen- tral Bank each day a list of applications for all imports against letters of credit. After the Central Bank approves an applica- tion, the letter of credit may be opened by the commercial bank. For prepaid letters of credit the Central Bank debits the account of the commercial banks for the peso equivalent at the time of approval of the letter of credit. The peso equiva- lent of other letters of credit is forwarded to the Central Bank after they have been negotiated and exchange is requested by the commercial bank. In principle, exchange for import pay- ments is made available within not more than five working days from the receipt of the application. Most imports are subject to an internal consumption tax of 20 per cent ad valorem. Virtually all imports are also subject to customs surcharges (impuestos interned ranging from 10 per cent to 200 per cent of the f.o.b. value; for most imports, however, they are 56.6 per cent. Imports of agricul- tural and industrial machinery and equipment and spare parts are subject to a single import tax (including customs duties) of 10 per cent. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require the prior approval of the Central Bank, which is given only after careful examination of the application and if the transaction is considered genuine. The allocation of foreign exchange for travel and for insur- ance premiums is suspended. Allowances for family remit- tances and medical expenses are rarely granted. Residents are not prevented, however, from purchasing exchange for travel purposes and personal remittances in the parallel market. Airline tickets are subject to a tax of 15 per cent when the price of the ticket is over RD$200 or from RD$5 to RD$25 when the price is RD$200 or less. Nonresidents working in the Dominican Republic may re- mit abroad for any purpose up to 60 per cent of their salaries. For students pursuing approved courses, exchange requests for monthly maintenance allowances are approved up to US$200 for studies in Latin America, Puerto Rico, and Spain, and up to US$230 for studies in the United States (except Puerto Rico), Canada, and other European countries. Ex- change is also sold for remittances to authorized students to meet expenses for tuition, books, and other fees. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Applications for exchange for contractual payments, such as interest and amortization payments on loans registered with the Central Bank, are approved in conformity with the terms of the contract. Transfers of profits and dividends are permitted only in respect of foreign investments that have been registered in the Central Bank and cannot exceed 18 per cent a year of the net value of the original and any additional investment, including reinvested profits. The Monetary Board, however, is empowered to authorize remittances in excess of 18 per cent when investments are deemed beneficial to the Dominican economy. Dividends remitted or credited to nonresidents are subject to a tax of 18 per cent. In principle, exchange for payments for invisibles is made available within five days from receipt of the application. Travelers are not permitted to take with them any domestic currency. Exports and Export Proceeds Export licenses are required for sugar, in connection with the operation of export quotas established under the Interna- tional Sugar Agreement, and for coffee, cocoa, and tobacco. Within two working days of receiving payment, exporters of Dominican products must surrender through the commercial banks to the Central Bank foreign exchange equal to 100 per cent of the f.o.b. or c.i.f. value of their exports. For the pur- pose of exchange surrender, declared export prices must equal or exceed the minimum export prices published by the Cen- tral Bank. Exempt from the exchange surrender requirements are foreign mining companies, and firms operating in indus- trial free zones, which are only required to convert sufficient foreign exchange to cover local costs and taxes. All exports of sugar and sugar by-products are subject to prior authoriza- tion by the committee consisting of the Minister of Finance, the Governor of the Central Bank, and the Executive Director of the Sugar Institute. Exporters may not extend credit for more than 90 days from the date of embarkation without authorization by the Central Bank. Proceeds from Invisibles The foreign exchange proceeds from invisibles are subject to surrender requirements and must be surrendered to the Central Bank through the commercial banks. The import of Dominican banknotes and coins is prohibited. Capital There are no restrictions on the inward movement of capi- tal by either residents or nonresidents. Inward capital remit- tances must be registered with the Central Bank and must be converted into pesos at that Bank. Registered foreign direct investments are eligible for remittances of profits and divi- dends. Registration is permitted for investments in agricul- DOMINICAN REPUBLIC ture, livestock, mining, manufacturing, tourism, transportation and communications, and finance companies. The Monetary Board may, however, permit the registration of other investments when deemed beneficial to the economic development of the country. Registration may cover the value of machinery and equipment, as well as intangible assets such as licenses and patents. Applications for approval of outward capital remittances must be submitted through the commer- cial banks to the Central Bank. Withdrawals of capital by foreigners leaving the Dominican Republic are authorized in reasonable amounts, sometimes with provision for the trans- fer to be effected in annual installments. Applications by residents to transfer capital abroad to make portfolio invest- ments, purchase real estate, etc., are not normally approved. Gold Residents may purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in the Dominican Republic for numismatic purposes. With this ex- ception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, in the Dominican Re- public or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry constituting the personal effects of a trav- eler require licenses issued by the Central Bank; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. Changes during 1973 January 11. Monetary Board Resolution No. 2 approved the participation of the Dominican Republic in the LAFTA multilateral compensation system, retroactive to January 1, 1973. February 16. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, a central rate of RD$1 = US$1 was established. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar remained unchanged. February 20. Import payments in currencies other than the U.S. dollar henceforth could be made only on a letter of credit basis. March 15. The Central Bank announced that all commer- cial arrears had been eliminated. April 10. Imports requiring a fully prepaid letter of credit ceased to be subject to prepayment of 80 per cent of import duties and surcharges. October 27. The par value was changed from 0.818513 gram to 0.736662 gram of fine gold per Dominican peso. The new par value corresponded to the central rate. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar remained unchanged at RD$1 = US$1. December 20. Monetary Board Resolution No. 10 extended the system of import controls until December 31, 1974. 137 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Exchange Rate System Imports and Import Payments ECUADOR The par value is 0.0355468 gram of fine gold per Ecua- doran Sucre, corresponding to S/ 25.00 = SDR 1. A central rate of S/ 25.00 = US$1 has been established, corresponding to 0.0294665 gram of fine gold per sucre or S/ 30.1587 = SDR 1. There are two exchange markets. In the official market the Central Bank maintains rates of S/ 24.80 buying, and S/ 24.95 selling, per U.S. dollar, which apply to export proceeds, import payments (except for printed matter and nonmonetary gold), certain invisible and capital transactions, and all transactions by the Government or public entities; however, the exchange transactions of the private petroleum companies must be conducted with the Central Bank, at S/ 25.00 = US$1, subject to an exchange tax of 1 per cent, buying and selling. All other transactions take place in a free market where the rate fluctuates according to supply and demand but in which the Central Bank intervenes in order to maintain the rate within the margins applicable to the official rate. Transactions eligible for the free market may alterna- tively be effected at the Central Bank, at its official market buying and selling rates. Ecuador formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, with effect from August 31, 1970. Administration of Control The Monetary Board has authority to shift transactions between the two exchange markets and has extensive powers with respect to import policy. The official exchange market is under the control and supervision of the Central Bank of Ecuador. The Central Bank also issues import and export licenses and registers foreign capital. Exports of coffee to "new markets," however, require the prior authorization of the Institute of Foreign Trade and Integration. Imports which enter as part of a direct investment and imports by foreign enterprises which have contracts with the Govern- ment require prior authorization by the Institute of Foreign Trade and Integration and by the Finance Ministry, respec- tively. However, all applications for import licenses by indus- trial firms must be submitted to the Central Bank. Prescription of Currency Most settlements with Eastern Germany, Hungary, Po- land, and Romania must take place through bilateral ac- counts. Payments between Ecuador and Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru must be made through accounts maintained with each other by the Central Bank of Ecuador and the other central banks concerned, within the framework of the LAFTA multilateral clearing system. Exchange pro- ceeds from other countries must be received in convertible currencies. Whenever possible, import payments must be made in the currency stipulated in the import license. 138 Permitted imports are divided into two categories: List I, consisting of essential and semiessential goods, and List II, consisting of less essential and luxury goods. All goods not included in these two lists are prohibited. Prior import li- censes are required for all permitted imports, with the excep- tions specified below. Books, newspapers, periodicals, and printed or recorded music may be imported freely without a license or consular invoice; payments have to be made through the free market. Medicine and spare parts for ma- chinery and automotive vehicles are free of license when val- ued at US$500 c.i.f. or less (US$500 f.o.b. or less for goods shipped by air). A few goods may be imported only from LAFTA countries, and some only from Paraguay; with these exceptions, import licenses are issued freely irrespective of the origin of the goods, provided that the appropriate import taxes have been paid, that the required prepayments of 80 per cent of import duties have been made, and that a certificate is submitted showing that the insurance has been arranged in Ecuador. The licenses automatically entitle the holders to obtain exchange at the official rate to cover the c. & f. value of the imports upon presentation of the shipping documents; advance payments for imports are permitted. Import licenses which do not entitle the importer to foreign exchange at the official rate ("no exchange licenses" or permisos de importa- tion no reembolsables) may be issued for goods financed from the proceeds of certain international loans, provided that these have been registered at the Central Bank, but such licenses are not required to import the goods concerned. The Monetary Board is authorized to shift items between Lists I and II and to prohibit the import of goods or lift import prohibitions when the economic situation of the coun- try and the balance of payments situation so require. Imports of crude petroleum receive a subsidy of S/ 7.07 per U.S. dollar invoiced on import documents and are exempt from all fiscal charges. The subsidy is received in the form of a tax credit certificate issued by the Central Bank on the basis of documentation approved by the Ministry of Natural Re- sources and Tourism that the import was effected, without relation to the import payment. Most imports are subject to a tax of 4 per cent levied on commercial transactions. Furthermore, List I goods are sub- ject to a tax of 1 per cent of the c.i.f. value and List II goods to a tax of 6 per cent of the c.i.f. value; the latter tax is reduced to 1 per cent for imports financed with foreign credit and for imports for which the Central Bank is not obliged to provide foreign exchange. Payments for Invisibles Exchange for payments in respect of certain current invisi- bles may be obtained from the Central Bank at the official rate. These invisibles are in principle limited to interest on foreign loans that have been registered at the Central Bank, dividends and profits on foreign investments registered at the Central Bank, payments by the Government and public enti- ties, and the necessary expenses of Ecuadorans studying at ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution universities abroad. Interest payments at the official rate may not exceed ll/2 per cent a year and remittances of dividends and profits at the official rate may not exceed 14 per cent of the registered value of the investment. With respect to loans to petroleum companies only, interest, commission, and other financial charges on foreign loans may not exceed the equiva- lent of 2 per cent above the rates of interest of the creditor country; moreover, annual amortization may not exceed the sum of undistributed profits, depreciation of fixed assets and liquidated assets, and any variation in working capital. There are also limits on student allowances eligible for the official rate; these range from US$300 to US$450 a month, depending on the type of study and on the country involved. All other payments for current invisibles, including travel expenditure, must be settled in the free market and are unre- stricted. There are no limitations on the amounts of domestic and foreign banknotes that travelers may take out. Residents traveling abroad by air must pay a tax of S/ 600 for each exit visa. Airline tickets for foreign travel are taxed at 10 per cent, while tickets for travel by ship are subject to tax at the rate of 8 per cent for departure from Ecuador and 4 per cent for the return trip to Ecuador. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports require licenses to ensure, among other things, the full surrender of the exchange proceeds to the Central Bank; licenses are issued freely, subject to guarantee. No surrender is required for exports effected under licensed bar- ter transactions. Reference prices are established for exports of bananas to help to ensure full surrender of the exchange proceeds. Reference prices are also established for exports of crude petroleum; these serve as the basis for the calculation of taxes, royalties, etc. Certain exports are subject to export taxes, payable at the time the export license is received. An export tax of 15 per cent is levied on coffee beans, cocoa beans, sugar, and crude petroleum. Certain exports exempted from the ad valorem export taxes receive a subsidy based on the f.o.b. value. The subsidy is received in the form of a tax credit certificate (certificado de abono tributario) on the basis of customs documentation. There are other export taxes in addition to those mentioned above. l Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from specified invisibles have to be sold to the Central Bank at the official rate. All other receipts, including those from travelers, may be sold in the free market. There are no limitations on the amounts of domestic and foreign banknotes that travelers may bring in. Capital Capital may freely enter or leave the country through the free market. Outward transfers through the official market are restricted. All foreign investments in Ecuador must be registered with the Central Bank in order to be entitled to foreign exchange 1 On January 19, 1974 a tax of 12 per cent ad valorem was imposed on sugar exports. ECUADOR at the official rate for remittances of interest, profits, divi- dends, and amortization; new investments require the prior authorization of the Institute of Foreign Trade and Integra- tion. In the case of investment for which exchange was sold to cover local costs, the investor must document that the exchange was sold to the Central Bank. For foreign capital entering in the form of machinery and equipment, the inves- tor must document that the merchandise has been cleared through customs and that it took the form of a "nonreimburs- able" import. Additionally, the investor must present to the Central Bank the certification from the appropriate ministry (Finance, Natural Resources and Tourism, or Production) that the declared value conforms to the actual value of the machinery and equipment. The Exchange Department of the Central Bank must submit a recommendation to the General Management of the Central Bank within 30 days from receipt of the request for registration and all pertinent documenta- tion. Thereafter, taking into account the interests of the Ecua- doran economy and priorities established in the country's development plans, the General Management of the Central Bank must approve or deny the registration within an addi- tional 30 days. In certain cases, where all documentation has been submitted, the Central Bank can provisionally register the investment for a period of up to 90 days. Similarly, loans in foreign exchange granted to the Govern- ment or to official entities must be registered with the Ex- change Department of the Central Bank; for private loans registration is required for statistical purposes. In the case of suppliers' credits and similar credit for financing the importa- tion of merchandise, no special registration procedure is re- quired; all the pertinent information on terms of payment, etc., is contained in the import license, and that provides the basis for purchase of exchange for remittance of interest, charges, and scheduled amortization. Foreign nationals are prohibited from owning rural properties and from owning or operating mining industries within 30 miles of Ecuador's coastline or borders. Foreign exchange at the official rate may be obtained for the withdrawal of foreign investment from Ecuador five years after the date of registration, on the basis of a schedule agreed by the Central Bank. Profits accumulated in previous years may be repatriated also on the basis of a schedule agreed by the Central Bank for investments which have completed the registration procedure. For investments registered on a provi- sional basis, no profits may be repatriated through the official market. Profit remittances may not exceed the limit (14 per cent a year) specified in the Foreign Investment Code of the Andean Pact. Residents who are private individuals are not granted offi- cial foreign exchange to purchase securities or real estate abroad. Commercial banks are authorized to maintain ac- counts with correspondent banks abroad in convertible cur- rencies. Gold Residents other than the Central Bank may export gold only in the form of filigree work whose gold content repre- sents not more than 25 per cent of its market value. Imports 139 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ECUADOR of monetary gold are reserved for the Central Bank; they are treated as List I imports, payable through the official market. Imports of nonmonetary gold in bars may be made by the Central Bank or by any other resident and are treated as List I imports, payable through the free market. Gold bars are exempt from import duty, while that on semiworked gold is 70 per cent ad valorem. Changes during 1973 January 1. Industrial firms had to submit all applications for import licenses to the Central Bank, as well as all applica- tions for exemptions or privileges under the Industrial Devel- opment Law. (Decree No. 1103 of September 27, 1972.) January 1. The bilateral payments agreement with Bulgaria became inoperative. It was formally terminated on Janu- ary 19. January 9. Decree No. 13 of the Institute of Foreign Trade and Integration provided that coffee exports to any destina- tion would be subject to minimum prices to be established later. January JO. Monetary Board Resolution No. 651 stipu- lated that all new foreign investments must be registered with the Central Bank after authorization of the investment had been obtained from the Institute of Foreign Trade and Inte- gration. Existing foreign investments had to be registered within 90 days. January 16. Decree No. 04-J created the National Fisheries Corporation. February 1. Monetary Board Resolution No. 654 of Janu- ary 31 provided that import items included in List I be con- solidated into new Categories A and B, with the former consisting of the old Categories A and B and the latter corre- sponding to the old Category C. The advance import deposit requirements were eliminated for the new Category A (previ- ously 10 per cent or 20 per cent) and reduced from 30 per cent to 10 per cent for the new Category B. There were no changes with respect to List II. February 6. Decree No. 111 created a Committee for Exter- nal Credit. February 14. Decree No. 146 provided that the certificados de abono tributario held by petroleum companies could be used to pay taxes, subject to a limit of 4.2 per cent a month of the total amounts individually held. February 26. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Ecuador established a central rate of S/ 25.00 = US$1. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar remained unchanged. No transactions were shifted from one exchange market to the other. The 1 per cent tax on sales and purchases of exchange in the free market was abolished. In the official market, Central Bank purchases and sales of exchange from and to petroleum companies took place at S/ 25.00 per US$1, plus or minus an exchange tax of 1 per cent, while the Central Bank set buying and selling rates of S/ 24.80 and S/ 24.95 per US$1 for all other official market transactions. In the free market, where the Central Bank would limit fluctuations to within 1 per cent either side of the central rate, the initial buying and selling rates were S/ 24.50 and S/ 24.60 per US$1. These measures were equiva- 140 lent to a de facto unification of the dual exchange market. The Central Bank subsequently adopted an "open window" policy under which it stood ready to effect at official market buying and selling rates any transactions that formally were eligible for the free market. February 26. Decree No. 185 imposed tariff levies of 1 per cent and 6 per cent on imports of goods on List I and List II, respectively. February 26. Monetary Board Resolution No. 655 of Feb- ruary 22 abolished the advance import deposit requirements. The final deposit rates had been zero or 10 per cent on List I goods and 100 per cent to 130 per cent on List II goods. March 12. Monetary Board Resolution No. 659 revoked Monetary Board Resolution No. 509 of February 2,1968 and thus permitted payments for imports on credit terms to be made prior to the due date. March 18. Resolution No. 18 of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Industry established minimum prices for coffee exports to traditional markets. April 9. Decree No. 347 reduced import duties on 150 commodities, including wheat, medicines and medical equip- ment, certain agricultural machinery and parts, and various intermediate goods used in agriculture and industry. April 13. Decree No. 421-A empowered the Central Bank to invest up to 10 per cent of the country's international reserves in foreign treasury bills and similar money market instruments. April 26. Decree No. 439 regulated the reference prices for petroleum exports. May 2. Decree No. 479 established that the 6 per cent charge on List II imports consisted of a 1 per cent charge applicable to all imports, plus a 5 per cent tax on luxury imports. No exemption could be granted from the 1 per cent element, except for imports financed with foreign credits and imports for which the Central Bank was not obliged to supply foreign exchange. May 15. Decree No. 528 established new reference prices for petroleum exports. May 16. Monetary Board Resolution No. 666 limited to 180 days the maximum term of credit for the payment of imports on List II.

Not for Redistribution EGYPT Exchange Rate System On September 18,1949, a par value for the Egyptian Pound was established by the Arab Republic of Egypt with the Fund. However, exchange transactions no longer take place at rates based on that par value. Most exchange transactions take place at rates based on the official rate of LE 1 = US$2.55555. The Central Bank of Egypt's official buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar on December 31, 1973 were LE 0.391305 and LE 0.393652, respectively. An exchange tax of 5 per cent is applied to most outward remittances of invisi- bles and capital at the official rate. An exchange rate of US$1.70 buying, and US$1.65 selling, per LE 1, is applicable to transactions in specified convertible currencies * in a parallel exchange market conducted through authorized commercial banks where the buying and selling rates are LE 0.5869 and LE 0.6065, per US$1. Banks require prior exchange control approval to deal among themselves in foreign currencies or to engage in arbi- trage transactions abroad; such approval is not required, however, for transactions effected through the parallel ex- change market or for balances held in specified foreign cur- rency accounts. Administration of Control Exchange control is supervised by a Supreme Committee for Foreign Exchange, which is set up by the Minister of Finance, Economy, and Foreign Trade. The exchange control laws, ministerial orders, decree-laws, instructions of the Min- ister of Finance, Economy, and Foreign Trade, and decisions of the Supreme Committee are carried out by a Director of Exchange Operations appointed by the Minister. A foreign exchange budget is established annually. Exchange control is implemented under the supervision and instructions of the Undersecretary for Finance, Economy, and Foreign Trade in Charge of Exchange Operations and the Foreign Exchange Budget and the Director of Exchange Operations. The techni- cal work of exchange control is performed by the Exchange Control Administration attached to the afore-mentioned Un- dersecretary. Banks are authorized to execute foreign ex- change transactions, within the framework of a general authorization, without need to obtain specific exchange con- trol approval. The General Control Authority for Exports and Imports supervises imports and exports; it also issues import licenses. Most imports and exports are carried out by public sector companies. Prescription of Currency Payments for imports normally may be made only to the country of origin. Payments to residents of countries with which Egypt does not have bilateral payments agreements 1 Convertible currencies for this purpose are listed as Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. For purposes of the parallel exchange market, banknotes in Kuwaiti dinars, Saudi Arabian rivals, and a few other currencies are also regarded as convertible. 142 may be made in the currency of the payee's country when that currency is available; in a convertible currency;1 in Egyptian pounds to the credit of the appropriate nonresident account; or in any other manner permitted by the Exchange Control Administration. Receipts other than those in respect of raw cotton exports may be accepted in the currency of the pay- er's country, if it is a currency acceptable to the Central Bank; in any convertible currency; in Egyptian pounds to the debit of an appropriate nonresident account; or in any other man- ner permitted by the Exchange Control Administration. The proceeds from exports of raw cotton to convertible currency countries must be received in deutsche mark, French francs, Japanese yen, or Swiss francs, or, if the importer resides in the United Kingdom or the United States, in sterling or U.S. dollars, respectively. Settlements with countries with which Egypt has payments agreements are made according to the terms of those agree- ments. 2 Certain settlements with countries with which in- demnity agreements concerning compensation for nationalized property are in force are made through special accounts in Egyptian pounds with the Central Bank of Egypt. Suez Canal dues must be paid in Egyptian pounds by debit- ing a Shipping Account No. 1. Balances on this type of ac- count may be created by selling a convertible currency to an authorized bank in Egypt or by debiting a Free Nonresident Account. Nonresident Accounts In addition to the special accounts related to the bilateral payments agreements of Egypt or to the indemnity agree- ments concluded with certain countries, there are three main types of nonresident accounts in Egyptian pounds: Free Non- resident Accounts, Nonresident C Accounts, and Nonresi- dent D Accounts. Free Nonresident Accounts may be opened in the name of any nonresident, irrespective of his country of residence, and by international organizations with headquarters in Egypt. They may be credited with proceeds from the sale of any convertible currency that has been transferred from abroad; with transfers from other Free Nonresident Accounts; with interest on the accounts; and with the Egyptian pound equiv- alent of any transfer authorized in convertible currency. They may be debited for payments due to residents; for transfers to other Free Nonresident Accounts or Nonresident C or D Accounts; and for payments abroad in any convertible cur- rency. Nonresident C Accounts may also be opened in the name of any nonresident, irrespective of his country of residence. They may be credited with proceeds from the sale of any convert- ible currency that has been transferred from abroad; with 2 Egypt has bilateral payments agreements with Albania, Algeria, Bulgaria, People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iraq, North Korea, Mongolia, Morocco, Poland, Romania, Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, Tunisia, U.S.S.R., North Viet-Nam, and Yemen Arab Republic. In addition, for the financing of trade in certain specified commodi- ties, credit facilities have been established between the Central Bank of Egypt and the central banks of Ghana, Guinea, India, Jordan, Mali, Somalia, Spain, Sri Lanka, and Turkey. There is also a special payments arrangement on the commercial bank level with Bangladesh. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution transfers from Free Nonresident Accounts or other Nonresi- dent C Accounts; and with any amounts authorized to be credited to these accounts by the Exchange Control Adminis- tration. They may be debited, subject to exchange control approval, for payments due to residents (except for exports, Suez Canal dues, and ships' disbursements); for transfers to other Nonresident C Accounts; for transfers to Nonresident D Accounts; and for payments abroad in convertible curren- cies. Nonresident D Accounts may be opened in the name of any resident of a payments agreement country (see footnote 2). The account must be designated by the name of the partner country concerned, and transfers from the account of one country to that of any other country may not be made with- out exchange control authorization. These accounts may be credited with the proceeds from the sale of any convertible currency that has been transferred from abroad; with trans- fers from a Free Nonresident Account and—provided that exchange control authorization is obtained—with transfers from a Nonresident C Account; with transfers from other Nonresident D Accounts of the same nationality; and with any sum authorized to be credited to the account. They may be debited for payments due to residents, except for exports, Suez Canal dues, and ships' disbursements, and—provided that exchange control authorization is obtained—for trans- fers to other Nonresident D Accounts and for payments to the country in whose name the account is designated. There are also blocked accounts, to which may be credited any payment to a nonresident not remittable under the ex- change control regulations. Transfers between blocked ac- counts require prior approval. These accounts may be debited for amounts up to LE 1,000 a year for living expenses of the account holder or his family in Egypt. They may also be debited, subject to prior approval, for investments in Egyp- tian Government loans or in registered shares in nominative form of companies established in Egypt, and for subscriptions to increases in capital of Egyptian companies in which the account holder is already a shareholder. Income derived from such investments may be remitted to the nonresident benefi- ciary. Blocked accounts held by juridical persons may be debited for amounts not exceeding LE 1,000 a year for settle- ment of obligations due to the Egyptian authorities, pay- ments to residents for services rendered, and expenses incurred in connection with the activities or residence of the holder's employees or representatives in Egypt. All accounts held by residents of Rhodesia also are blocked; no transactions on these accounts may take place without prior approval. In addition, there are certain types of foreign currency accounts that may be held by nonresidents or persons who for certain exchange control purposes are treated as nonresi- dents. These foreign currency accounts are of four types, as indicated below. External Accounts of Nonresident Aliens may be opened in the name of nonresident foreigners. They may be credited with convertible currencies transferred from abroad; foreign currency transferred from other accounts of the same type; and bank interest on balances in these accounts. They may be debited for amounts of foreign exchange sold to the Central EGYPT Bank of Egypt at the official exchange rate to cover local payments; transfers to other accounts of the same type; and transfers abroad in any convertible currency for the benefit of nonresidents (or, if the account is held by a juridical person, for the benefit of residents who are employed by the holder of the account). External Accounts of Resident Aliens may be opened in the name of foreign residents who for exchange control purposes are treated as nonresidents in respect of income they receive from abroad. They may be credited only with convertible currencies transferred from abroad and with bank interest on balances in these accounts. They may be debited only for amounts sold at the official exchange rate to the Central Bank of Egypt to cover local payments and for transfers abroad in any convertible currency for the benefit of the account holder, his parents, wife, or children. External Accounts of Egyptian Citizens may be opened in the name of citizens who for exchange control purposes are treated as nonresidents in respect of income they receive abroad, such as emigrants and Egyptians working abroad for over five years. They may be credited with convertible curren- cies transferred from abroad and with bank interest on bal- ances in these accounts. They may be debited for transfers abroad in any convertible currency for the benefit of the account holder, his parents, wife, or children; and for sales of foreign currency for Egyptian pounds to the bank at which the account is held, at the parallel market rate. Foreign Currency Resident Accounts of Egyptian Citizens may be opened for Egyptians working abroad or performing services in Egypt for foreign persons or firms. They may be credited with convertible currencies transferred from abroad that represent their foreign currency income after deduction of the prescribed percentages that must be repatriated and surrendered at the official rate; bankers checks, travelers checks, and letters of credit denominated in convertible cur- rency; foreign banknotes; and bank interest. They may be debited for transfers abroad in the name of the account holder while he is abroad; travel and living expenses abroad of the account holder, his parents, wife, or children; transfers abroad for the benefit of the account holder to cover personal expenses; and sales of foreign currency for Egyptian pounds to the bank at which the account is held, at the parallel market rate. Imports and Import Payments Imports of certain goods from any source, and all imports from Israel, Rhodesia, and South Africa, are prohibited. No exchange is allocated in practice for many goods that are considered nonessential or that are also produced locally. Certain commodities, mostly when imported by the private sector, are financed at the parallel market rate. Most imports are made by publicly owned commercial companies affiliated with the Egyptian General Trade Orga- nization. Some imports may also be made by certain indus- trial and other public sector establishments. Private sector imports are handled by a Foreign Trade Company. A Supreme Council for the Planning of Foreign Trade is entrusted with establishing long-term policy for exports and 143 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution EGYPT imports, controlling the annual export and import plan, and supervising the execution of the foreign exchange budget. The ministries concerned are responsible for setting priorities re- garding imports and their timing, within the framework of quarterly foreign exchange programs. Foreign Trade Com- mittees in the various ministries consider import and export offers for the goods within their competence, in the light of specifications, prices, delivery dates, and means of payment. Approval by a foreign trade committee constitutes the neces- sary authorization for the implementation of import transac- tions. For purposes of administration, the economy is divided into several sectors (agricultural, industrial, transportation, etc.). The annual foreign exchange budget provides for a specific quota for each sector, and the authorities in charge of the sector decide upon the goods to be imported within that quota. In drawing up this budget, an estimate is made first of the country's export proceeds and its earnings from invisibles, as well as the expected availability of foreign loans and other credit facilities. Allowance is then made for the commitments falling due during the fiscal year in respect of foreign debt service and other obligations, as well as pay- ments for invisibles. The remaining resources in convertible and bilateral currencies are allocated to the various sectors of the economy in accordance with the priorities given to the import requirements of each. An External Financing Com- mittee has been established in accordance with Ministerial Decree No. 607 of 1971. It coordinates foreign exchange requirements and available resources by drawing up quarterly programs for the implementation of the annual foreign ex- change budget. By virtue of Order No. 478 of 1973, all goods may be imported without an import permit; imports are regulated by exchange allocations rather than by import licenses. A development tax of 10 per cent of the c.i.f. value is payable on imports; the tax is 5 per cent for certain highly essential foodstuffs imported by the Ministry of Supply. A statistical tax of 1 per cent of the c.i.f. value is payable on all imports except wheat. Payments for Invisibles Banks are authorized to provide exchange for payments for certain invisibles in accordance with general authorizations and instructions and up to specific quotas. Private travel abroad normally requires an exit visa (except travel to the Libyan Arab Republic or the Syrian Arab Republic). Egyp- tian nationals who have deposited earnings from their work abroad, or from services performed for nonresidents, in speci- fied foreign currency accounts, may use this foreign exchange freely for any travel expenses for themselves, their wives and children, or their parents. Other residents may purchase, through local banks and up to specified amounts, the foreign exchange required for travel expenses and certain other pur- poses, at the parallel market rate. An exchange tax of 5 per cent is applied to all payments for invisibles at the official rate, except students' remittances, government payments, and transfers of funds for pilgrimages. 144 Travelers may not export Egyptian pound banknotes. Egyptian nationals working abroad and returning to their place of work may take with them any remaining foreign exchange which they had brought in and declared; foreign travelers leaving Egypt may take out only the balance after deduction of the equivalent of £ stg. 5 for each night spent in Egypt. Residents may not take out foreign exchange in excess of the equivalent of £ stg. 30 without specific permis- sion. Exports and Export Proceeds Apart from exports to Israel, Rhodesia, and South Africa, which are prohibited, and commodities required for the na- tional economy, whose export may be restricted, exports may be made free of license. Exports of many products are orga- nized and supervised by Foreign Trade Committees. Cotton, rice, and petroleum are exported by the public sector only. The proceeds in specified convertible currencies from exports other than raw cotton, cotton yarn and cotton textiles, rice, petroleum and petroleum products, onions, garlic, potatoes, cement, and re-exported foreign goods, may be retained for six months in domestic foreign currency accounts. Balances in these accounts may be used by the holder to make pay- ments for certain imports or current invisibles or may be sold to banks at the parallel market rate. Export proceeds must be repatriated within three months from the date of shipment of the goods. Proceeds from ex- ports to payments agreement countries must be obtained in accordance with the provisions of the relevant agreement. Some exports to specified countries may be settled through indemnity accounts in Egyptian pounds. Proceeds from Invisibles The parallel market rate is applied to foreign exchange remitted by Egyptians abroad and sold to a bank, to foreign exchange remitted by citizens of Arab countries for purposes other than investment, and to foreign currency sold by tour- ists. This facility is applicable to specified convertible curren- cies only. Physical persons who are considered nonresidents (includ- ing emigrants of Egyptian nationality, Egyptian nationals who have been resident abroad for at least five consecutive calendar years, and foreigners who reside in Egypt) are not obliged to transfer to Egypt any part of their foreign earnings. They may retain these earnings in foreign currency accounts. Egyptian nationals who are working abroad for a period of less than five calendar years or who perform services for nonresidents are obliged to repatriate fixed percentages of their foreign income and may retain the balance in foreign currency accounts. With these exceptions, all persons and legal entities in Egypt are obliged to offer to authorized banks at the rate of exchange quoted by the Central Bank, within one month from the date of their collection abroad, all pro- ceeds in foreign currencies derived from invisibles. Suez Canal dues must be received in Egyptian pounds from a Shipping Account No. 1, which may be credited only with the proceeds from sales of convertible currencies or by transfers from a Free Nonresident Account. Certain travel in Egypt by non- ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution residents may be financed from Nonresident C Accounts, or, under indemnity agreements with specified countries, from Nonresident T Accounts. Persons arriving in Egypt from abroad may not import Egyptian pound banknotes but are permitted to bring in, and to use locally, unlimited amounts in foreign exchange, subject to customs declaration. Foreign travelers must convert into Egyptian currency the equivalent of £ stg. 30 to obtain an entry visa. Capital Egyptian nationals who have deposited foreign earnings in specified foreign currency accounts in Egyptian banks may use this foreign exchange for any purpose, including transfer abroad. With this exception, outward capital transfers by residents are severely restricted. Egyptian emigrants are au- thorized to transfer funds and /or to take out jewelry and other valuables up to LE 200 a person or LE 500 a family; in addition, they may export freely personal effects and furni- ture up to LE 200 a person or LE 500 a family. Capital transfers abroad are subject to an exchange tax of 5 per cent. Nonresidents may purchase freely securities on stock ex- changes in Egypt against payment in foreign currencies ac- ceptable to the Central Bank of Egypt or in Egyptian pounds by debiting an appropriate nonresident account. Certain cate- gories of securities may be bought to the debit of blocked accounts (see section on Nonresident Accounts, above). Pro- ceeds from sales of securities held under "nonresident dos- sier" are credited to blocked accounts. Transfers of securities between nonresidents require prior approval. Transfers abroad are permitted in respect of (1) securities drawn or matured in accordance with the original terms of issue; (2) the value of life or endowment policies on surrender or at matu- rity; (3) matured mortgages; and (4) accrued alimony under court orders up to LE 5,000. An amount not exceeding LE 5,000 a family—irrespective of whether the sum is made up of capital or income—may be released from a family's assets in Egypt to residents of foreign nationality who acquire nonresident status. Any amount above this limit is credited to a blocked account. Any pay- ment of a capital nature not remit table under the exchange control regulations must be credited to a blocked account. The Foreign Investment Law of September 23, 1971 defines the treatment of new foreign investments. Requests for trans- fers of profits not covered by this law are considered on an individual basis. Gold The monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form. Other resi- dents may only hold and acquire gold coins and gold jewelry in Egypt. There is a free market for gold coins in Cairo. With the exception of monetary gold, imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry are restricted. EGYPT Changes during 1973 January 10. The incentive exchange rate was changed from LE 0.65 buying and LE 0.68 selling, per US$1, to LE 0.66 buying and LE 0.70 selling, per US$1. February 26. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Egypt maintained its official ex- change rate in terms of gold and in terms of U.S. dollars and changed the official rate to LE 1 = US$2.55555. Buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were set at US$2.55555 and US$2.54031, respectively, per LE 1, or LE 0.391305 buying, and LE 0.393652 selling, per US$1. Previously, the official exchange rate was LE 1 = US$2.30. February 26. The incentive exchange rate was changed to LE 0.62 buying and LE 0.65 selling, per US$1. February. The bilateral payments arrangement with Cuba was terminated. September 1. Order No. 477 introduced a new parallel market arrangement for specified transactions when settled in specified convertible currencies. Transactions in the parallel market took place through the commercial banks at fixed rates resulting from the application of premiums (which could be changed by the Central Bank) to the official buying and selling rates; these premiums were 50 per cent (buying) and 55 per cent (selling) and were applied to the official rates of LE 0.391305 and LE 0.393652 per US$1, respectively. The resulting effective rate for the U.S. dollar was LE 0.6065 selling, and LE 0.5869 buying. The parallel market rates were applicable to all means of payment, including both banknotes and banking transfers. All export subsidies were discontinued for exports qualifying for the parallel market. The following foreign exchange earnings were channeled through the parallel market: (1) savings and private remit- tances of Egyptians abroad; (2) receipts from foreign tourists (individual and group travel, but not airline or shipping fares earned by Egyptian transport companies); (3) funds trans- ferred by citizens of Arab countries for purposes other than investment; (4) proceeds from exports of mostly nontradi- tional commodities (i.e., exports other than raw cotton, cot- ton yarn and textiles, rice, petroleum and petroleum products, onions, garlic, potatoes, cement, and re-exports of foreign goods); and (5) 50 per cent of convertible currency proceeds in excess of annual export targets for cotton yam and cotton textiles. In addition, the Minister of Finance, Economy, and Foreign Trade was empowered to allocate to the parallel market foreign exchange received from transac- tions effected in the official market. The following outward payments could be made through the parallel market: (1) all permitted payments, on the basis of the existing exchange control regulations, for current invis- ibles by private individuals and the rest of the private sector, including travel expenses; (2) payments for private sector imports of production requirements, machinery, instruments, and spare parts for industrial, agricultural, professional, and handicraft production; (3) payments for imports by the public and private sectors of the tourist industry of machinery, in- struments, and spare parts; (4) payments for other current invisibles and production requirements, when financed from the payer's own receipts from exports or tourism; and (5) 145 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution EGYPT payments for any other import transactions that might be approved by the Ministry of Finance, Economy, and Foreign Trade, such as luxury items needed in the tourist sector, or machinery, etc., needed by the private sector or the tourist sector and imported by a Foreign Trade Company to meet overall domestic requirements. Recipients of foreign exchange eligible for the parallel mar- ket could retain such exchange for six months, provided it was deposited with an authorized commercial bank, but they could also sell it to a commercial bank at the parallel rate; at the end of this period any unutilized exchange had to be sold to the bank concerned at the parallel rate of exchange. Deal- ings in the parallel exchange market were exempt from autho- rization or exchange license. Applications for permission to import under the new arrangements had to be submitted to the Misr Company for Export and Import. The approved application then was to be presented to the commercial bank selling the foreign exchange; the latter, however, could adjust its sales of foreign exchange in light of the availability of foreign exchange in the parallel market. The imports con- cerned had to be effected by the Misr Company for Export and Import, but private individuals could make direct im- ports valued at up to LE 200. September 1. Order No. 478 revised certain import regula- tions, including those for personal imports by Egyptian citi- zens returning from abroad and by foreign nationals residing in Egypt. September 24. Foreign buyers of raw cotton were required to guarantee 40 per cent of the purchase price when placing orders. Guarantees in U.S. dollars and sterling were accepted only from U.S. and U.K. importers. Importers in other countries had to deposit French francs, deutsche mark, Jap- anese yen, or Swiss francs. Corresponding rules were issued for the invoicing and settlement of cotton exported to the convertible area. November 1. The 1972 trade agreement with the EEC for- mally came into effect. 146 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Exchange Rate System Imports and Import Payments EL SALVADOR The par value is 0.294665 gram of fine gold per Salvadoran Colon, corresponding to t 3.01587 = SDR 1 or £ 2.50 = US$1. The rates of the Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador for transactions with the public are £ 2.49 buying, and 0 2.51 selling, per US$1. Exchange transactions by commercial banks with the public take place at or within these limits. A stamp tax of V10 of 1 per cent is applicable to all sales of exchange as well as drafts and other documents embodying a right to exchange; on amounts below £ 100,000 the tax is levied at fixed amounts that may be slightly in excess of V10 of 1 per cent. On November 6, 1946, El Salvador notified the Fund that it was prepared to formally accept the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control Subject to any directives issued by the Monetary Board, exchange control authority is exercised by the Central Re- serve Bank through its Exchange Control Department. Au- thority to approve certain payments, including most import payments, is delegated to the commercial banks. Exchange licenses for imports must be obtained from the Exchange Control Department. The Central Reserve Bank is also em- powered to license exports, but this power has not been exer- cised. Exports of a number of commodities require licenses issued by the Ministry of Economy or of Agriculture. Exports of coffee are supervised by the Salvadoran Coffee Company and require licenses issued by the Ministry of Finance. Prescription of Currency Payments to Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nica- ragua in respect of trade and specified invisibles must be settled in the currencies of those countries or in Salvadoran colones through the Camara de Compensation Cen- troamericana, a clearinghouse established by the central banks of Central America to foster the process of economic integration of their countries. Payments to Mexico are also settled through the clearinghouse. Otherwise, residents are free to make authorized payments in any currency they choose. Nonresident Accounts Accredited diplomatic missions and other foreign institu- tions or persons established in El Salvador may be authorized to hold nonresident accounts in U.S. dollars with authorized banks, provided that such accounts are credited with foreign exchange received from abroad. Banks also may freely open foreign currency accounts in the names of physical persons (whether of foreign or Salvadoran nationality) who reside abroad. All nonresident accounts may be utilized freely, but the commercial banks must make periodic reports to the Central Reserve Bank of the movements on such accounts. In addition, there are certain facilities for resident accounts in foreign currencies. Imports from all countries must be registered with the Central Reserve Bank before orders are placed; orders for imports from countries outside Central America must be ap- proved by the Exchange Control Department. Import li- censes are required for airplanes, firearms, ammunition, military equipment, dynamite, cotton for industrial use, jute sacks, skins, leather, some chemical and pharmaceutical products, coffee for seeding, sugar, and saccharin. Payments and transfers abroad do not require exchange licenses, provided that the terms of payment do not exceed a certain maximum (counted from the date of entry of the merchandise into a customs warehouse): (1) Imports of raw materials for industry, iron and steel products for the con- struction industry, various spare parts, greases, and lubri- cants, when the terms of payment do not exceed three years. * (2) Imports of staple food products, medicinal products, and medical and surgical supplies, when the terms exceed one year. 2 Imports of the following goods are not subject to maximum credit terms: machinery and equipment for agricul- ture and industry, semiprocessed goods for industrial produc- tion, surgical equipment, research and educational equipment, scientific and technical books, fertilizers, and in- secticides. A prior import deposit in local currency, equiva- lent to 100 per cent of the c.i.f. value, is applied to specified nonessential food products, confectionery, alcoholic bever- ages, tobacco products, perfumes, cosmetics, watches, and jewelry. Small businesses are exempt from this requirement. With one exception noted below, all goods not mentioned previously in this paragraph may be imported only against payments before customs clearance, in which case no ex- change control approval is required. Imports from countries outside the Central American Common Market that apply discriminatory restrictions against exports from El Salvador also must be paid for before customs clearance, with the exception of industrial raw materials; for the latter, the Cen- tral Reserve Bank approves credit terms of up to three years (medicines from Mexico may be paid for within 90 days). The commercial banks are authorized to provide exchange for all import payments, provided that the permissible credit terms are not exceeded, and, up to US$100 for each order for noncommercial imports. When suppliers abroad request pay- ment in advance for commodities valued at over US$500, a prior deposit of 10 per cent calculated on the value of the advance payment is required from the importer as a guaran- tee, but industrial and agricultural firms may be exempted. The deposit requirement is 100 per cent for goods valued at over US$500 that are subject to the 100 per cent prior import deposit; the latter may be used to finance the deposit on the advance payment. These regulations are also applicable to 1 Four years when the goods originate in countries with which El Salvador had a favorable balance of trade in the previous calendar year, from which it receives loans with a maturity of at least 20 years, or with which an integration treaty is in force or with which El Salvador maintains other economic ties. 2 Eighteen months when the goods originate in countries with which El Salvador had a favorable balance of trade in the previous calendar year, from which it receives loans with a maturity of at least 20 years, or with which an integration treaty is in force or with which El Salvador maintains other economic ties. 147 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution EL SALVADOR goods imported from other countries in the Central American Common Market. Guarantee deposits are refunded when the goods arrive in the country, provided that payment in full has been made to the exporter. Imports from Panama that are covered by the Free Trade Agreement with that country and imports made by small traders and industrial producers (up to US$500 for each order and up to US$30,000 a year for each importer) are exempt from the ruling exchange control regu- lations. Imports originating outside the Central American Com- mon Market are subject to an import surcharge of 30 per cent of the applicable import duty; the surcharge is not applied to certain industrial equipment and raw materials that are du ty free by virtue of the Industrial Incentives Law. Payments for Invisibles The commercial banks are authorized to sell foreign ex- change, without prior authorization from the Central Reserve Bank, for medical and hospital costs abroad, subscriptions to foreign literature, correspondence courses, and memberships in professional clubs and societies and, up to established limits, for travel, study, and family remittances. Payments for other current invisibles and amounts in excess of basic quotas require exchange licenses, which are granted freely for most items, although for certain payments only up to specified limits. The basic exchange allocation for travel outside the Central American area (interpreted to mean the Central American Common Market) for tourism, business, or health reasons is, free from deposit requirements, the equivalent of US$2,100 a person a trip, on the basis of US$70 a person a day (US$1,050 for children under 16 on the basis of US$35 a day); for amounts in excess of US$2,100 a person a trip, up to an additional US$4,200 (for amounts in excess of US$1,050 up to an additional US$2,100 for children under 16), a 10 per cent guarantee deposit in local currency must be lodged with the Central Reserve Bank, which is released upon the travel- er's return. 3 No exchange license is needed to make transfers of up to US$400 a month (up to US$200 a month for chil- dren), for up to 12 months, to each Salvadoran with perma- nent residence abroad; larger amounts may be authorized when the need therefor is shown. Students are allowed US$300 a month, for up to 12 months, in addition to an installation allowance, tuition, and other expenses. For Salvadoran nationals traveling to Central American countries, the commercial banks have been delegated author- ity to provide exchange up to the equivalent of US$2,100 (US$1,050 for children under 16) in Costa Rican colones, Honduran lempiras, Nicaraguan cordobas, or Guatemalan quetzales, or a cashier's check in Salvadoran colones (for payment through the Camara de Compensation Cen- troamericana). Requests for larger amounts must be submit- ted to the Central Reserve Bank. International sea and air passages are subject to a travel tax of 10 per cent of the price of the ticket; official or diplomatic travel is exempt. 3 Exchange up to the equivalent of US$3,000 (in excess of US$2,100) for specific clinic or hospital expenses abroad is exempt from the guarantee deposit requirement. 148 Insurance and reinsurance premiums may be paid in for- eign exchange, provided that the insurance contract was reg- istered with the Exchange Control Department at the time it took effect. Alternatively, insurance companies may receive premiums in colones and periodically obtain from the Ex- change Control Department authorization to purchase the foreign currencies they are obliged to transfer abroad. For- eign currencies derived from insurance or reinsurance con- tracts must be surrendered to the Central Reserve Bank or to an authorized commercial bank. Travelers may take out 0 200 in domestic notes and coins. This limit is subject to modification, however, to facilitate border trade with other Central American countries. Nonres- ident travelers may upon departure reconvert (C 200 into foreign currency. Exports and Export Proceeds Export licenses are not required except for a number of foodstuffs and other items of which the authorities wish to ensure an adequate local supply, but the proceeds of all ex- ports must be received through a bank in El Salvador and the foreign exchange must be surrendered to the Central Reserve Bank or an authorized commercial bank. Export transactions must be declared to the Exchange Control Department within 15 days of shipment. The collection terms normally must not exceed 90 days, but longer credit terms may be authorized by the Exchange Control Department. With the exception of sales to "new markets," exports of coffee are subject to an export tax. Proceeds from Invisibles All exchange receipts from invisibles must be surrendered to the Central Reserve Bank or an authorized commercial bank. Travelers may bring in £ 200 in domestic notes and coins. This limit is subject to modification, however, to facili- tate border trade with other Central American countries. Capital All exchange receipts resulting from capital transactions must be surrendered. Payments abroad representing capital movements require exchange licenses; such licenses are not granted for resident-owned capital except for investments in Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. The entry of capital in the form of foreign investment may be registered with the Ministry of Economy. Registration ensures (1) free remittance of net profits on foreign capital invested in indus- trial enterprises, enterprises engaged in the extraction of non- renewable natural resources, and enterprises in the sphere of tourism; (2) the remittance of net profits of enterprises en- gaged in other activities up to a limit of 10 per cent a year of the registered capital (larger amounts may be authorized in special cases by the Ministry of Economy); (3) repatriation of the proceeds from the total or partial liquidation of the enter- prise (after payment of taxes) in proportion to the participa- tion of foreign capital in the total capital; (4) remittance of the sales proceeds of shares and other instruments representing investments or participations, including capital gains; and ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution (5) with respect to loans, interest and amortization as deter- mined at the time of registration. In the cases under (3) and (4) there is required, in addition to the approval of the Ex- change Control Department, the prior approval of the Minis- try of Economy. Foreign investments made in El Salvador prior to June 1, 1961 must also be registered by the Ministry of Economy or the Exchange Control Department in order to enjoy the same facilities. The Exchange Control Department authorizes, without re- striction, the remittance abroad of foreign currency for the payment of interest and amortization on short-term loans from abroad that have been approved by and registered with the Exchange Control Department; foreign loans with a ma- turity of up to one year must be authorized by the Central Reserve Bank, while foreign loans with a maturity of more than one year must be authorized by the Ministry of Econ- omy. The Central Reserve Bank controls the short-term for- eign liabilities of the commercial banks through a system of individual quotas. Decree No. 279 of March 27, 1969 sets certain minimum capital requirements for businesses that are owned by foreign nationals and for those in which foreign nationals have a shareholding interest. For purposes of this Decree, foreign nationals are defined as persons who are not citizens of one of the five countries of the Central American Common Mar- ket. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in El Salvador for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Central Reserve Bank; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the mone- tary authorities and industrial users. In practice, imports of nonmonetary unworked gold are made only by a jewelers' cooperative acting on behalf of its members and other users. Changes during 1973 February 14. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar was maintained unchanged at £2 .50 = US$1. February 15. The exchange control regulations concerning import payments were liberalized. Commercial banks were authorized to provide exchange for all import payments, without referring to the Central Reserve Bank, provided that the prescribed maximum credit terms were observed. February 15. Basic exchange allocations for travel outside the Central American Common Market countries for tour- ism, business, or health reasons, free of the deposit require- ment, were increased from US$600 a person a trip to US$2,100 a person a trip, on the basis of US$70 a person a day (US$1,050 for children under 16, on the basis of US$35 EL SALVADOR a day). Amounts in excess of these authorized amounts, sub- ject to the deposit requirement, were increased to an addi- tional US$4,200 (an additional US$2,100 for children under 16). The amounts of exchange that banks could provide for travel to Central American countries were increased and were made uniform at the equivalent of US$2,100 a person a trip (US$1,050 for children under 16). Allocations for family re- mittances and student expenses also were increased, and there were certain liberalization measures for such items as pay- ments for correspondence courses and for membership fees. Commercial banks were henceforth authorized to sell foreign exchange corresponding to the basic travel quotas and for certain other current invisibles; previously, an exchange li- cense from the Central Reserve Bank was required in all cases. February 15. Additional facilities for the opening of nonres- ident accounts in foreign currencies, as well as resident ac- counts in foreign currencies, were created. Banks were also authorized to open accounts in foreign exchange for Salva- doran nationals residing abroad. June 12. Decree No. 357 exempted imports of wheat and wheat flour from all customs duties and taxes. August 1. Industrial raw materials were exempted from the 100 per cent import deposit required for imports from those countries outside the Central American Common Market that apply discriminatory restrictions against exports from El Salvador; payment for these imports would be authorized by the Central Reserve Bank, provided the terms of payment did not exceed three years. August 1. The exemption from the exchange control regula- tions for imports made by small traders and industrial pro- ducers was increased from US$15,000 a year to US$30,000 a year for each importer. August 1. Banks were authorized to sell foreign exchange up to the equivalent of US$80 a person to nonresident foreign and Salvadoran nationals on departure from the country. August 23. Decree No. 407, which came into force on Sep- tember 6, 1973, created a Monetary Board charged with the formulation of monetary, exchange, credit, and financial poli- cies. Its specific duties included setting the exchange rate for the colon, determining the appropriate level and composition of the foreign exchange reserves, and establishing any mea- sures to regulate international payments. The Decree amended the charter of the Central Reserve Bank accord- ingly. September 21. Export controls were imposed on raw cotton and cotton yarn. October 3. Exports of sugar were prohibited. October 3. Export controls were imposed on molasses. October 3. Exports of hides were prohibited. October 18. The par value was changed from 0.327405 gram to 0.294665 gram of fine gold per Salvadoran colon, corresponding to £ 3.01587 = SDR 1. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar remained unchanged at £ 2.50 = US$1. 149 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution EQUATORIAL GUINEA Exchange Rate System The currency of Equatorial Guinea is the Equatorial Guin- ean Peseta, which is issued by the Central Bank of the Repub- lic of Equatorial Guinea and is defined as equivalent to 0.0126953 gram of fine gold. No par value has been estab- lished for the Equatorial Guinean peseta. The currency is at par with the Spanish peseta, which is Equatorial Guinea's intervention currency. Rates for other currencies are based on those in the Madrid exchange market. There are no forward exchange facilities. Exchange taxes of 17.5 per cent, 25 per cent, and 35 per cent are levied on certain transfers abroad. Administration of Control The Central Bank is in charge of exchange control. Ex- change transactions must be carried out through the Central Bank or authorized commercial banks abroad; the only au- thorized bank is the National Deposit and Development Bank. Import and export licenses are issued by the Director- ate-General of Foreign Commerce in the Ministry of Com- merce; import licenses also require the approval of the Central Bank. Prescription of Currency Settlements with Spain must be made through payments agreement accounts denominated in U.S. dollars. Settlements with other countries are made in convertible currencies. Imports and Import Payments All commercial imports require an import license. Licenses normally are issued within the framework of an annual im- port program. They do not entitle importers to the necessary foreign exchange until they have been approved by the Cen- tral Bank, after which the exchange is automatically made available. Licenses for imports from Spain usually have a validity of three months, and those for other countries a validity of six months. Payments for Invisibles All payments for current invisibles require the prior ap- proval of the Central Bank, which for specified purposes and up to specified amounts has delegated its approval authority to the authorized commercial bank. Residents 1 are granted foreign exchange up to the equivalent of EG Ptas 10,000 a person a calendar year for tourist travel abroad. The stan- dard allocation for business travel is the equivalent of EG Ptas 2,000 a person a day, subject to a maximum of EG Ptas 50,000 a trip. For study abroad, foreign exchange is granted to cover tuition and living expenses; nonboarding students are allowed the equivalent of EG Ptas 5,000 a month for living expenses. 1 Residents are defined as persons remaining in Equatorial Guinea for more than six months in a calendar year or for more than six months in two consecutive calendar years. 150 The transfer of wages and salaries by alien residents, and of professional earnings as well as dividends by all residents, is freely permitted up to 60 per cent of taxable earnings when the transfer is made to a country with which a payments agreement is in force, and up to 40 per cent for other countries, provided that annual earnings do not exceed EG Ptas 50,000. Larger transfers are permitted when annual earnings exceed EG Ptas 50,000. Transfers abroad of profes- sional earnings by nonresidents are freely permitted, but any amounts in excess of 60 per cent of taxable earnings are subject to a transfer tax of 35 per cent on the amount trans- ferred. There are special arrangements for the transfer of earnings of Nigerian workers employed in Equatorial Guinea. In addition, nonresidents as well as nationals residing tempo- rarily abroad are permitted to withdraw up to EG Ptas 5,000 a month from their savings accounts for remittance abroad. The transfer of net investment income, whether by resi- dents or nonresidents, is subject to a tax of 35 per cent of the amount transferred. Subject to this requirement transfers are fully permitted. In the event of at least 50 per cent of such net investment income being reinvested in approved projects in Equatorial Guinea, the tax is 17.5 per cent of the amount remitted. Transfers abroad in respect of patents, trademarks, and royalties are permitted fully, subject to a tax of 25 per cent of the amount remitted. Travelers may take out EG Ptas 3,000 a person in domestic banknotes. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports require an export license. Both specific and general export licenses are granted; the latter are available only to registered exporters. All export proceeds must be surrendered to the Central Bank or the authorized commer- cial bank. Proceeds from Invisibles All exchange receipts from invisibles must be surrendered to the Central Bank or the authorized commercial bank. Travelers may bring in any amount of foreign banknotes and coins but the import of domestic currency by travelers is prohibited. Capital All imports and exports of capital require approval. Capi- tal receipts in foreign currency must be surrendered to the Central Bank or the authorized commercial bank. The trans- fer abroad of funds from the sale of fixed assets and financial assets by alien residents or by nonresidents is permitted as follows: 50 per cent of the total amount realized net of taxes may be remitted abroad immediately and the balance in 24 equal monthly installments. The sale of real estate, however, requires prior approval by the Government. Residents, as well as nonresidents living in Equatorial Guinea, are prohib- ited from engaging in borrowing or lending with nonresi- dents. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Gold not permitted to hold gold. All purchases and sales of minted gold and gold bars are centralized in the Central Bank, which also has a monopoly over the import and export of minted gold and gold bars. Commemorative gold coins were issued in 1970 in denomina- tions of EG Ptas 250, 500, 750, 1,000, and 5,000; these are legal tender. Except for these coins and jewelry, residents are Changes durine 1973 February 13. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the gold content of the Equatorial Guinean peseta was maintained unchanged and the currency remained at par with the Spanish peseta. EQUATORIAL GUINEA 151 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ETHIOPIA Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.355468 gram of fine gold per Ethiopian Dollar, corresponding to Eth$2.50 = SDR 1 or Eth$2.07237 = US$1, and Ethiopia avails itself of wider margins. The intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. The National Bank of Ethiopia (the central bank) does not deal with the public; its dealings in U.S. dollars with the authorized banks take place at the official rate of Eth$2.07 = US$1. Authorized banks in dealing with the public must observe this official rate for the U.S. dollar and prescribed commission charges of 0.75 per cent buying and 2.25 per cent selling; the resulting effec- tive buying and selling rates are Eth$2.05448 and Eth$2.11658per US$1. Spot exchange rates for other currencies are based on the National Bank's official rate for the U.S. dollar and the previ- ous day's closing rates against the U.S. dollar in European exchange markets; a charge equivalent to about V2 per cent, additional to the prescribed commissions, is payable for transactions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Autho- rized banks may freely undertake forward exchange transac- tions. Exporters may cover their exchange risk in Ethiopia or abroad. Administration of Control All transactions in foreign exchange must be carried out through authorized banks and authorized dealers under the control of the National Bank. All payments abroad require licenses issued by the Exchange Controller, whose office is a department of the National Bank; all exports are licensed by the Exchange Controller to ensure the surrender of the for- eign exchange proceeds. The Minister of Commerce, Indus- try, and Tourism has statutory authority to prohibit, restrict, or regulate imports and exports. Prescription of Currency Outgoing payments are normally made in convertible for- eign exchange appropriate to the country of the recipient or in U.S. dollars. The net proceeds of exports must be received in a foreign currency that is freely convertible, or in any other foreign currency acceptable to the Exchange Controller. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents may, subject to exchange control approval, open nonresident accounts either in Ethiopian dollars or in foreign currencies at authorized banks. Balances in foreign currency accounts may be freely transferred abroad. Trans- fers between nonresident accounts require prior approval, except those between foreign currency accounts. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Portugal and its overseas territories, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. No import li- censes are required. However, payments abroad for imports require exchange licenses; these licenses are granted freely in 152 the currency appropriate to the country of origin, or in any convertible currency that may be requested, but advance pay- ment for imports is not normally permitted. Payment is nor- mally authorized by letter of credit, mail transfer, telegraphic transfer, or cash against documents at sight or on an accep- tance basis; however, goods which were previously subject to advance deposit requirements (about 100 items, mostly con- sumer goods) may not be financed on an acceptance basis. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles require exchange licenses. Invisi- bles connected with trade transactions are treated on the same basis as the goods to which they relate. Foreign nation- als may remit up to 35 per cent of their salaries or annual taxable earned income, provided that they have resided in Ethiopia for less than six years; exceptions may be made, particularly with regard to the time limit, for foreign nation- als who are in contractual service with the Ethiopian Govern- ment or with certain other public and private institutions, and who have an employment contract specifically entitling them to remit a stated percentage of their earnings, provided this aspect of the contract is approved by the National Bank. Ineligible persons may apply for exchange to meet expenses for maintenance of bona tide dependents, education of chil- dren, medical care, and premiums on insurance policies taken out before April 2, 1962; applications are considered on their merits. Subject to proper provision having been made for local taxation and for a reserve prescribed by the Commercial Code, foreign companies may remit dividends on their in- vested and reinvested capital in any currency. Persons traveling abroad are allowed foreign exchange equivalent to Eth$75 a day for a maximum period of six weeks in any one calendar year if the journey is made for business purposes, and up to the equivalent of Eth$600 a year for persons 16 years of age or over and Eth$420 a year for those under 16 if the journey is made for pleasure. Travelers may take with them a maximum of EthSlOO in Ethiopian banknotes. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Portugal and its overseas territories, Rhode- sia, and South Africa are prohibited. Exports of most cereals to any destination also are prohibited. All commodities re- quire export licenses and some require in addition the ap- proval of specified public bodies. When applying for a license, an exporter must specify the goods to be exported, the desti- nation, and the value. The granting of the license by the Exchange Controller enables the goods to pass through cus- toms. The licensing system is used to ensure that foreign exchange receipts are surrendered to the National Bank within six months and that export proceeds are received in an appropriate currency (see section on Prescription of Cur- rency, above). ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange receipts from invisibles must be surren- dered. Persons may bring in a maximum of Eth$100 in Ethio- pian banknotes. Foreign exchange need not be declared by travelers on entry, and its re-export is freely permitted. Capital Controls over capital movements are designed to restrict undesirable outflows, to preclude an unwarranted accumula- tion of external debt, and to keep the authorities informed of the country's external debt position. All receipts of capital in the form of foreign exchange must be surrendered. Exchange control permits are not required, but registration of capital inflows with the exchange control authorities establishes evidence of receipt, which is required for any later repatriation. There is no discrimination regard- ing the currencies in which foreign investments are accepted. Special concessions are made to approved new enterprises involving an investment of at least Eth$200,000 financed by domestic or foreign capital: these concessions include exemp- tion from income taxes for a period of five years, admission of imports of machinery free of duty, and a guarantee of permission to foreign investors to remit abroad earned profits after taxation. Upon liquidation, transfer of the entire im- ported capital and reinvested profits is permitted in any cur- rency, provided that the capital inflow has been registered; for large amounts, transfers may be phased over a reason- able period of time. Foreign physical or juridical persons re- quire government permission to purchase land in Ethiopia; such permission is not normally withheld. Transfers of emi- grants' allowances, legacies, and savings of foreign employ- ees upon retirement are permitted up to the equivalent of Eth$70,000 in foreign currency. Sums in excess of this amount are authorized up to a total of Eth$70,000 in any subsequent 12-month period. Repatriation of nonregistered capital is subject to the same limits. Borrowing abroad requires exchange control approval and is restricted. Normally, evidence must be presented that all possibilities for domestic borrowing have been exhausted. External borrowing by the Central Government and public sector agencies requires parliamentary approval, as does pri- vate sector borrowing abroad when covered by a government guarantee. Authorized banks may freely place their funds ETHIOPIA abroad, except on fixed-term deposit. They need the prior approval of the National Bank to overdraw their accounts with foreign correspondents, to borrow funds abroad, or to accept deposits in foreign currency. Gold Special commemorative gold coins which are legal tender, as provided in Legal Notice No. 318 of 1966 and Legal Notice No. 422 of 1972, are offered for sale in Ethiopia and abroad by the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia to residents and nonresi- dents and may be exported by travelers. The ownership of personal jewelry and articles of adornment of which gold or platinum forms a part also is permitted. Unless specifically authorized by the Minister of Mines, the possession or cus- tody, in a quantity in excess of 50 ounces, of raw or refined gold or platinum or of gold or platinum in the form of nug- gets, ores, or bullion constitutes an offense. Certain mined gold is sold by the Treasury to the National Bank at a price equivalent to Eth$87.50 (US$42.22) a fine ounce of purely refined gold. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require exchange licenses issued by the National Bank on behalf of the Ministry of Mines. Such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users; those for the import of gold for industrial purposes are issued to registered importers on satisfactory evidence that the gold is destined for direct use in industry. Changes during 1973 February 15. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Ethiopia maintained its par value in terms of gold. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar was changed from US$1 = Eth$2.30263 to US$1 = Eth$2.07237. The official rate applicable to U.S. dollar trans- actions between the National Bank and the commercial banks was changed from Eth$2.30 to Eth$2.07 per US$1. The rates of exchange commission set in Directive No. 6 of Decem- ber 30, 1971 remained unchanged. Ethiopia continued to avail itself of wider margins. February 22. The National Bank announced that a special buying rate of Eth$2.16 per U.S. dollar would be applied by commercial banks to U.S. dollar proceeds from coffee exports shipped in the period February 1-13, 1973. April 11. Exports of most cereals were prohibited. 153 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FIJI Exchange Rate System l Fiji has not yet established a par value for its currency, the Fiji Dollar, with the Fund. A fixed relationship between the Fiji dollar and the pound sterling, the intervention currency, is maintained at £ stg. 1 = FS1.88. As a result, all exchange transactions except those in sterling and currencies directly linked to sterling take place at fluctuating rates. For tele- graphic transfers, the banks' buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar on December 31, 1973 were FS0.8022 and FS0.8195, respectively, per US$1. Fiji formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sec- tions 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement on August 4, 1972. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Central Monetary Authority, acting as agent of the Government. The Monetary Authority delegates to authorized dealers (only banks are authorized dealers in Fiji) the authority to approve normal import payments. Except with the specific permission of the Monetary Authority, residents of Fiji are required to offer for sale to an authorized dealer all foreign currencies they re- ceive. 2 The Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Coopera- tives is responsible for the issue of import licenses. Export licenses are issued by the Comptroller of Customs. Prescription of Currency Fiji has ceased to be a Scheduled Territory in terms of the U.K. Exchange Control Act, 1947 but under current U.K. exchange control regulations continues to be regarded as a country of the Overseas Sterling Area. Transactions with Sterling Area countries as well as non-Sterling Area countries are subject to exchange control. Settlements with residents of any country may be made in Fiji currency through an Exter- nal Account or in any foreign currency. The prescribed man- ner of payment for exports to any destination outside Fiji is payment in Fiji currency from an External Account or in any foreign currency. All payments to Rhodesia are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts A nonresident 3 may maintain an External Account in Fiji currency or a foreign currency account with an authorized bank; such accounts may be opened without the specific ap- proval of the Central Monetary Authority. These accounts may be credited freely with interest payable on the account, payments from other External Accounts, the proceeds of sale 1 With effect from February 25, 1974 Fiji established a central rate of FS0.800000 = US$1, corresponding to 0.920828 gram of fine gold per Fiji dollar or SDR 1.03619 = F$l, and availed itself of wider margins. The fixed rate for the pound sterling was discontinued. 2 Under Fiji's exchange control regulations, foreign currencies are all currencies other than the Fiji dollar. All foreign currencies are regarded as specified currencies and hence must normally be offered for sale to an authorized bank. 3 A nonresident is a person or firm whose country of normal domicile or established residence is a country outside Fiji. As regards individuals, a resident of Fiji is a person who either has lived or intends to continue living in Fiji for a period of at least three years. 154 of foreign currency or foreign coin by the account holder, and Fiji currency notes which the account holder brought into Fiji or acquired by debit to an External Account or by the sale of foreign currency in the country during a temporary visit; in addition, External Accounts may be credited with payments by residents for which either a general or specific authority has been given. External Accounts may be debited for payments to residents of Fiji, transfers to other External Accounts, payments in cash in Fiji, and purchases of foreign exchange for travel purposes. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Rhodesia are prohibited, and imports originating in the People's Republic of China and the CMEA countries 4 require individual licenses. Imports of most goods are free under open general license when originating in countries other than those mentioned. However, import pro- hibitions are imposed on a few commodities from all sources, mainly for security, health, or moral reasons. Certain com- modities can be imported only under specific licenses, includ- ing passenger automobiles, butter, matches, cement, and gold. Payments for authorized imports are permitted upon appli- cation and submission of documentary evidence to authorized dealers. A specific exchange license is not required. Autho- rized banks may authorize payments for goods which have been imported either under a specific import license or open general license. Authorized banks may authorize advance payments for imports only if the goods have already left the port of shipment; in all other cases advance payment requires the permission of the Central Monetary Authority. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles originating in any country (except Rhodesia) are permitted either under a delegated authority to banks or, where large amounts or nondelegated payments are involved, upon application to the Central Monetary Author- ity. Payments may be made freely for all bona fide current transactions. Residents of Fiji traveling to other countries are entitled to a foreign currency travel allowance for private or business travel up to the equivalent of FS600 a journey. In addition, each traveler may take with him F$50 in Fiji cur- rency, and the equivalent of FS200 in other currencies. Any additional foreign currency required for travel purposes is granted on application to the Central Monetary Authority, provided the Authority is satisfied that the additional amount is required to meet genuine travel expenditures. Travelers may not take out more than F$50 in domestic currency notes and F$l in domestic coins. Exports and Export Proceeds Exporters are obliged to collect the proceeds of exports within six months of the date of exportation of the goods from 4 The open general license lists the countries to which it is not applicable as Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Hungary, North Korea, Poland, Romania, and U.S.S.R. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Fiji, irrespective of the currency in which the payment is being made. All foreign currencies must be offered for sale to an authorized dealer. Exporters may not grant credit to a nonresident buyer in excess of six months without specific permission. Exports to Rhodesia are prohibited. Specific licenses are required only for the export to countries outside the Sterling Area of lumber and a few other items, including pearl shell and turtle shell. Irrespective of any export licensing require- ments, however, exporters are required to produce an export permit for commercial consignment of all goods with an f .o.b. value exceeding F$ 1,000 and for private consignment of goods with an f.o.b. value exceeding F$2,000; this permit is required for exchange control purposes. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles must be surrendered to authorized dealers, irrespective of the currency concerned. Travelers may bring in freely any amount in Fiji notes, other Sterling Area currencies, or non-Sterling Area currencies. Resident travel- ers are required to sell their holdings of Sterling Area and non-Sterling Area currencies to an authorized dealer within 30 days of return. Capital The inflow of capital is unrestricted. Foreign investment in Fiji normally is expected to be financed from a nonresident source. Such foreign investment may be given "approved sta- tus," which guarantees the right to repatriate dividends and capital. All capital outflows are subject to prior approval. Capital transfers by residents to finance direct investments require the specific permission of the Central Monetary Au- thority and are normally permitted only where benefits will accrue to Fiji within a reasonably short term. Banks require the approval of the Central Monetary Authority before any loans are granted to a company or branch in Fiji (other than a bank) which is by any means controlled by persons resident outside Fiji or by individuals designated as nonresidents; however, banks do not require such approval to lend up to F$ 1,000—for any period and any purpose—to individual nonresident customers. Banks may not lend foreign currency to any resident of Fiji without the specific permission of the Central Monetary Authority, and residents require specific permission from the Central Monetary Authority before they may borrow foreign currency from anyone other than an authorized bank in Fiji or from any source outside Fiji. The transfer of inheritances and dowries which are due to nonresi- dents is permitted, as is the transfer of the sales proceeds of a house owned by a nonresident. Residents of Fiji are also allowed to make cash gifts equivalent to FS500 a donor a year to nonresidents; additional funds are permitted in compas- sionate cases. Emigrants may take out all their assets, whether their destination is inside or outside the Sterling Area. Residents are not permitted to purchase foreign currency to acquire foreign currency securities without the prior ap- proval of the Central Monetary Authority. The purchase of personal real property outside Fiji is not permitted. Portfolio FIJI investment in Fiji by nonresidents is permitted, provided that payment is made from a nonresident source; the proceeds of the sale or realization of such investment qualify for repatria- tion. Gold Residents may freely hold gold coins, but not gold bullion, in Fiji. The export of gold coins requires the specific permis- sion of the Central Monetary Authority. Gold imports from all sources require a specific import license issued by the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Cooperatives; they are restricted to authorized gold dealers and are subject to a 25 per cent duty when of Commonwealth origin or 50 per cent when of other origin. Gold jewelry may be imported free of duty from all sources and does not require any license when valued at less than FS200. 5 Authorized jewelry manufacturers are entitled to rebate to the extent of duty paid on gold imports if they prove that imported gold has been manufactured into jewelry in Fiji. Exports of gold jewelry do not require licenses and are free of export duty. All newly mined gold is sold in Australia at free market prices. Changes during 1973 February 20. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the fixed relationship of £ stg. 1 = FS1.98 was maintained and the Fiji dollar continued to float with sterling. April 5. The Central Monetary Authority of Fiji was estab- lished. In addition to exchange control and banking supervi- sory functions, it was given the sole right of issuing currency notes and coins. May 1. The private travel allowance for travel outside Fiji was increased from FS500 to F$600 a person a trip. The allocation for business travel also was increased from F$500 to F$600 a person a trip. May 1. The supervision over borrowing and lending be- tween residents and nonresidents was tightened. May 1. The amount of domestic banknotes that a traveler could take out was reduced from FS100 to F$50. June 1. The Central Monetary Authority began to adminis- ter exchange control, acting as agent of the Government. All existing exchange control regulations were canceled and a new exchange control manual was issued. July 1. The Central Monetary Authority of Fiji took over the assets and liabilities of the Currency Board of Fiji. September 7. Imports of certain food items were exempted from customs duty. September 10. Following the revaluation of the Austra- lian and New Zealand currencies, the fixed relationship be- tween the Fiji dollar and the pound sterling was changed from £ stg. 1 = FS1.98 to £ stg. 1 = FS1.88. The Fiji dollar continued to float with sterling. 6 With effect from January 1,1974 a new, single-line customs tariff came into effect and the preferential duties on goods of Commonwealth origin were abolished. Gold coins became free of import duty and fiscal tax. Gold bullion also became free of import d u ty but was subject to a fiscal tax of 7 ^ per cent. 155 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Exchange Rate System Nonresident Accounts FINLAND The par value is 0.211590 gram of fine gold per Finnish Markka. A central rate of Fmk 3.90 = US$1, corresponding to Fmk 4.19997 = SDR 1, has been established and Finland avails itself of wider margins. However, on June 4, 1973 the authorities ceased to observe the lower exchange rate margin. The Bank of Finland's official buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, on December 31, 1973 were Fmk 3.836 and Fmk 3.854 per US$1. The official rates for the U.S. dollar are applicable also to clearing dollars. Official fixed buying and selling rates are applied to the clear- ing ruble; these are based on the Gosbank's rates for the U.S. dollar against the ruble. Market rates are quoted by the Bank of Finland for certain other currencies; l these are based on market rates abroad. The Bank of Finland in addition quotes daily forward rates for the U.S. dollar at which authorized banks may cover their contracts with resident customers relating to any type of transaction permitted by the exchange control regulations; otherwise, forward premiums and discounts are left to the interplay of market forces. Authorized banks may deal among themselves, with resident customers, and with nonres- ident banks in U.S. dollars and other convertible or externally convertible currencies. Forward transactions may be con- cluded freely for periods not exceeding 12 months and the Bank of Finland may in special cases grant cover to the authorized banks for up to 24 months. Administration of Control The Bank of Finland operates the exchange control system, delegating authority to the authorized exchange dealers (mainly commercial banks). Import and export licensing is administered by an office subordinate to the Ministry of Trade and Industry, the Licensing Office, which is headed by a Licensing Board composed of government officials, includ- ing a representative of the Bank of Finland. Prescription of Currency For prescription of currency purposes, countries are di- vided into two groups: the bilateral countries 2 and the con- vertible currency countries (all others). Settlements with the bilateral countries must be made in the currency of the agree- ment (rubles for the U.S.S.R. and Romania, Finnish markkaa for the People's Republic of China, and U.S. dollars in all other cases) or in Finnish markkaa through Restricted Ac- counts. Settlements with the convertible currency countries may be made in any convertible currency or through Convert- ible Accounts. 1 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Icelandic kronur, Italian lire, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. 2 At the end of 1973 Finland had bilateral payments agreements with Bulgaria, People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and U.S.S.R. However, settlements with Czecho- slovakia and Poland were experimentally placed on a fully convertible basis for the year 1970 and these arrangements have since been continued. 156 There are three categories of nonresident accounts: Con- vertible Accounts, Restricted Accounts, and Capital Ac- counts. Convertible Accounts are held by nonresidents in Finnish markkaa or in convertible currencies. These accounts may be credited by an authorized bank with amounts transferred from other Convertible Accounts, Finnish currency received direct from a foreign bank or imported into Finland, amounts which the bank would be authorized to transfer abroad, amounts of convertible currency received by the bank, and interest accrued on funds held in the accounts. These ac- counts may be debited freely and balances may be transferred abroad freely to any country. Restricted Accounts are held by residents of countries with which Finland has bilateral payments arrangements, are des- ignated according to the holder's country of residence, and may be held in Finnish markkaa or the appropriate bilateral agreement currency. They may be credited by an authorized bank with amounts with which the bank may credit a Con- vertible Account, amounts transferred from Restricted Ac- counts related to the same country, Finnish currency received from a bank in the country indicated on the account, amounts which the bank is authorized to receive to the credit of a Restricted Account related to the country indicated on the account, currency surrendered to the bank and restricted to the country indicated on the account, and interest accrued on funds held in the accounts. These accounts may be debited freely and balances may be transferred freely to the bilateral country concerned. Capital Accounts comprise all other nonresident accounts. The assignment of a Capital Account to another nonresident and the transfer abroad of funds held in such an account may be effected only with the permission of the Bank of Finland. A monetary institution may credit a Capital Account with amounts which may be credited to Convertible or Restricted Accounts, amounts transferred from a Convertible or a Re- stricted Account, the purchase price of assets other than foreign securities bought from the holder by a resident, re- demption payments and interest on matured bonds and de- bentures quoted on the Helsinki Stock Exchange, rent on property owned in Finland by the holder of the account, and interest accrued on funds held in the accounts. Capital Accounts may be debited freely for noncommercial current expenses in Finland of and for account of the account holder, and funds in Capital Accounts may be used for capital payments for account of the account holder when the transac- tion does not require authorization or is authorized for trans- ferable funds. The Bank of Finland automatically grants permission for transfers abroad of funds deposited in Capital Accounts to an account holder who has resided abroad dur- ing the last calendar year and who continues to do so. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Rhodesia are prohibited. Most goods may be imported free of license from the multilateral area or ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution license-free area (i.e., nearly all countries with which Finland does not have bilateral payments agreements), 3 provided that the goods are purchased from and originate in that area. Specified consumer durables, however, are temporarily sub- ject to ad hoc import licensing, irrespective of origin. Certain other goods may be imported from the multilateral area un- der a global quota system, which provides for import licenses to be issued at least up to the amounts of 11 value quotas for specified commodity groups; no industrial goods are re- stricted by global quotas. The total value of the global quotas for 1973 was less than 1 per cent of total 1973 imports. All remaining goods require an individual license when imported from the multilateral area and are set out in a negative list, the discretionary licensing list, which comprises only agricul- tural commodities, coal, coke, and petroleum products. The only commodities still subject to quantitative restriction for the multilateral area, in addition to the consumer durable goods mentioned above, are agricultural commodities, fuels, and gold and silver. Import licenses are not required for most commodities originating in and shipped from the U.S.S.R., and for many commodities originating in and shipped from the other bilat- eral countries; all commodities liberalized for import from the bilateral area are among those already liberalized for import from the multilateral area. Other imports from the bilateral countries are admitted under licenses up to quotas provided for under the relevant trade agreement. All imports of com- modities originating in countries classified neither in the mul- tilateral area nor in the bilateral area require individual licenses. The State Granary is the main agency for the import of wheat, rye, barley, oats, and products of these grains for human consumption, but individual importers may also im- port these commodities under license. There is a state monop- oly for imports of alcoholic beverages. Exchange is granted by authorized banks for all permitted imports on presentation of an application form, the import license if required, and the original commercial invoice, pro- vided that the goods are already in the country or there is sufficient evidence to guarantee their importation. Payment for imports must be made within six months after the arrival of goods in the country; if the period of credit exceeds six months, the credit must be authorized by the Bank of Finland but is approved provided that it is considered normal in the traditions of the trade. Under a temporary scheme, however, payment for specified consumer goods must be made, or the markka equivalent of the purchase price deposited with the Bank of Finland, before the goods are released by the customs authorities. Payments for Invisibles With few exceptions (relating to transport and insurance), residents are permitted to conclude transactions involving current invisibles with nonresidents. Payments in respect of authorized invisibles are not restricted. The authorized banks have general permission to effect payments for most current invisibles, subject in some cases to a maximum allowance or 3 The exceptions are People's Republic of China, Republic of China, North Korea, Mongolia, Rhodesia, North Viet-Nam, and Republic of Viet-Nam. FINLAND other conditions; for amounts in excess of the standard allow- ances and for purposes for which no standard allowances have been set, exchange licenses are granted freely by the Bank of Finland. All contracts involving payments to nonres- idents for which general permission has not been granted must be submitted to the Bank of Finland for approval. For minor payments, authorized banks may grant foreign ex- change equivalent to Fmk 200 a calendar month for each remitter. A Finnish resident going abroad (except for border travel) may purchase from commercial banks foreign exchange equivalent to Fmk 3,000 a trip. A Finnish traveler abroad may also withdraw foreign exchange on a bank account pass- book or check issued by a Finnish monetary institution, pro- vided that the utilized amount of his travel allocation does not exceed a total of Fmk 3,000. In addition, a resident traveler may use a credit card abroad for travel services and make the payment after return. Nonresident travelers may take out Fmk 3,000 a trip in Finnish notes and coins and any amount in foreign notes and coins declared upon entry. Resident travelers may take out foreign or domestic currency, or any combination of these, up to Fmk 3,000. For all types of travel, bona fide applications for additional amounts of foreign ex- change are approved by the Bank of Finland. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Rhodesia are prohibited. Export licenses are required only for exports of scrap metal and, temporarily, of petroleum products. Exports of other goods require only an export control declaration, which is approved automatically by the Licensing Office except in a few specified cases. Certain exports to countries not in the multilateral area are restricted. Foreign exchange acquired through commodity exports need not be surrendered to the Bank of Finland or an authorized exchange dealer. Exporters are required to repatriate their foreign exchange proceeds within eight days of collection, which may then be held in a foreign currency account with an authorized bank in Finland or converted into domestic currency. The acceptance of advance payments for exports of wood, wood products, and charcoal requires the permission of the Bank of Finland, which normally prescribes that part of any prepayments authorized should be deposited with the Bank on an interest-bearing account, balances in which are released pan passu with the realization of the export shipments. 4 Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange receipts derived from current invisibles do not have to be surrendered but must be repatriated within eight days of collection. The exchange may be held in a for- eign currency account in Finland. Any unutilized foreign banknotes and travelers checks must be repatriated, but these are exempt from the surrender requirement up to Fmk 3,000 for each resident holder. The import of Finnish and foreign means of payment is unrestricted. 4 These arrangements were terminated on January 22, 1974. 157 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FINLAND Capital Most outward transfers of nonresident capital are subject to approval by the Bank of Finland. Inheritances are trans- ferred automatically up to Fmk 100,000 for each beneficiary, while authorization by the Bank of Finland is required for larger amounts. Persons who during the last calendar year have resided outside Finland and continue to do so may transfer abroad their assets in Finland in one lump sum, subject to the prior approval of the Bank of Finland, which generally is granted. Nonresidents may purchase through an authorized bank, against convertible currencies or by debiting a Convertible Account, bonds, debentures, or shares quoted on the Helsinki Stock Exchange. When the securities so acquired by a nonres- ident are deposited in the custody of the authorized bank, the nonresident purchaser is permitted to sell the securities on the stock exchange through the authorized bank and to repatriate the proceeds of the sale in a convertible currency. The acquisi- tion with funds classified as Capital Accounts of shares, bonds, and debentures quoted on the stock exchange is also permitted automatically, but proceeds from the sale of such securities may not be transferred abroad without the permis- sion of the Bank of Finland. Any other transactions in, and the export of, securities involving nonresident interests re- quire approval. If the securities were acquired with convert- ible foreign exchange or with markkaa from a Convertible Account, approval for their export can be obtained freely. The regulations concerning inward direct investment are as follows: All incoming capital transactions must be approved by the Bank of Finland, which considers the foreign exchange aspect. The Bank grants permission liberally, unless the in- vestment is judged to be exceptionally detrimental to the national interest or to be of a purely financial character. Repatriation of authorized direct investments is free. Foreign investments that involve a participation of more than 20 per cent in the share capital of an enterprise require the approval of the Council of State. This approval is usually granted liberally. Direct foreign investment in the forest and mining industries and in certain traditionally regulated activities is not normally permitted. On demand of the Bank of Finland, residents must declare their foreign assets, including property owned abroad. Pro- ceeds from the sale of securities and real property must be repatriated under the general rule of repatriation. Outward transfers of capital by residents require individual approval; investment by residents in foreign securities or real estate is rarely permitted. Authorized banks, however, are given per- mission to purchase specified foreign and Finnish securities issued abroad. For direct investment abroad, approval is granted on the merits of each case. Finnish emigrants are granted an exchange allowance of up to Fmk 50,000 a person, in addition to the basic tourist travel allowance. There is an automatic exchange allowance of Fmk 1,000 a calendar month for each donor for gifts and contributions to nonresidents. Foreign currency borrowing by Finnish residents, in the form of short-term or medium-term financial credits or by bond issues abroad, requires the specific approval of the Bank 158 of Finland, which exercises surveillance over the terms and timing. Lending to nonresidents is normally restricted to ex- port credits. No permission is needed for customary export credits. Medium-term and long-term borrowing abroad, other than borrowing by the State or import credits, is subject to a selective deposit requirement, the terms of which are set ad hoc by the Bank of Finland. Gold Residents may freely hold, buy, and sell gold in any form at home. Imports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Licensing Office; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. The global quota list contains a quota for industrial gold. Commercial imports of articles containing gold require licenses issued by the Licensing Office; for most such articles, these are granted freely. Exports of gold are subject to the same regulations as exports of other commodities, i.e., an export control declara- tion approved by the Licensing Office is usually sufficient. Changes during 1973 January 1. New exchange legislation came into operation. The Law on Trade in Foreign Exchange (of December 30, 1959), the Law on the Regulation of Foreign Exchange (of December 4, 1959), and the relevant decrees and regulations were abrogated. They were replaced by the Law on the Right to Deal in Foreign Exchange (Statute Roll No. 909/72), the Law on Foreign Exchange (No. 910/72), and the related Decisions of the Council of State (No. 911 /72) and the Bank of Finland (No. 912/72) on the application of the new legisla- tion. The Law on the Right to Deal in Foreign Exchange was of a permanent nature, while the Law on Foreign Exchange and the related Decisions of the Council of State and the Bank of Finland were to expire on December 31, 1974. The main purpose of the reform was to bring the exchange legislation up to date without altering the degree of control. A major feature was the replacement of the surrender require- ment for foreign exchange receipts of residents by the obliga- tion to repatriate all foreign exchange proceeds; repatriated foreign currency could either be converted into Finnish mark- kaa or held in a domestic foreign exchange account with an authorized bank in Finland. Previously, the surrender re- quirements were applicable mainly to export proceeds, freight earnings, and proceeds from the sale of securities and real property. The scope of the powers delegated to authorized banks to approve outward payments, which had been increased on November 1, 1972, was maintained. January 1. The system of nonresident accounts was reorga- nized. The Foreign Exchange Accounts, in which convertible or bilateral foreign currencies could be held, were discontin- ued, and the Convertible Markka Accounts and Restricted Markka Accounts, in which only domestic currency could be held, were replaced by Convertible Accounts and Restricted Accounts, which could be denominated either in domestic or foreign currency. Under the new arrangements, all nonresi- dent accounts could be freely debited, but funds withdrawn ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution from Capital Accounts could be transferred abroad only with the approval of the Bank of Finland. January 1. The import regulations for 1973 entered into force. The global quota program consisted of 11 quotas amounting to Fmk 57.2 million. January 1. Lending of domestic currency to nonresidents was freely permitted up to Fmk 50,000 for each borrower, for expenditures in Finland only. February 1. The industrial free trade arrangements applica- ble to imports from Denmark and the United Kingdom were provisionally extended until December 31, 1973. February 15. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Finland established a new central rate of Fmk 3.90 = US$1 to replace the central rate of Fmk 4.10 = US$1, and continued to avail itself of wider margins. May 16. A treaty of cooperation was signed with the Coun- cil for Mutual Economic Assistance. It came into force on July 14. The agreement was to be seen as a general accord providing a framework for more detailed agreements on co- operation in various economic fields. June 4. The Bank of Finland ceased to ensure the enforce- ment of the lower exchange rate margin and the markka began to appreciate in terms of the U.S. dollar. Exchange rate policy would continue to aim at ensuring that the effective value of the markka remained stable in terms of a weighted average of exchange rates of Finland's main trading partners. June 15. The general permission to importers to avail them- selves of commercial credits not exceeding six months granted by nonresidents was revoked. Import payments for specified commodities, primarily automobiles and other con- sumer durable goods, had to be made through an authorized bank or an amount equivalent to their purchase price had to be deposited with the Bank of Finland prior to release by the customs authorities. The goods concerned represented about one fourth of total imports; the arrangements were similar to those in effect from 1970 to 1972. June 15. Medium-term and long-term borrowing abroad under loan agreements approved by the Bank of Finland after FINLAND June 14 became subject to a selective deposit requirement. The borrower had to undertake to deposit in an interest-bear- ing account with the Bank of Finland such portion of the credit as might be agreed upon. The proportion to be depos- ited and the deposit period depended on the estimated financ- ing requirements of the investment project in question and the stage of the business cycle at the time of the loan approval. The interest rate would be determined in advance. It was set at the rate obtained by the Bank by placing the currency concerned on international money markets. The deposits, which normally would be lodged in the currency borrowed, were to be released when price pressures and the danger of an overheated economy were reduced. Exempt from the de- posit requirement were loans contracted by the State and import credits. The Bank of Finland announced that, despite the introduction of the deposit requirement, it would con- tinue to give favorable consideration to applications for bor- rowing abroad. August 29. A temporary import licensing system was intro- duced for certain consumer durable goods (passenger auto- mobiles, motorcycles, boats, boat engines, household refrig- erators and freezers, washing machines, sewing machines, radio and television sets, stereo appliances, record players, and similar household appliances). Many of these goods were among those affected by the June 15 measure. September 12. The acceptance of advance payments for exports of wood, articles of wood, and charcoal required the authorization of the Bank of Finland, to which authorization conditions could be attached. The Bank prescribed that part of any prepayments authorized be deposited with it on an interest-bearing account. Balances would be released pari passu with the realization of export shipments. (These ar- rangements were terminated on January 22, 1974.) October 5. The industrial free trade agreement with the EEC, which had been initialed in 1972, was signed. It became effective on January 1, 1974. October 31. Exports of petroleum products were restricted. November 1. The country coverage of Finland's generalized tariff preferences was expanded. 159 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FRANCE1 Exchange Rate System 2 The par value is 0.160000 gram of fine gold per French Franc, corresponding to F 5.55419 = SDR 1 or F 4.60414 = US$1, and France avails itself of wider margins. At pres- ent, however, no exchange transactions take place at the par value. There are two exchange markets, the official market, where the Exchange Stabilization Fund may intervene to en- sure its orderly operation, and the financial franc market, in which rates are determined by supply and demand, free from official intervention. In neither market are exchange rates for spot exchange transactions maintained between any an- nounced limits. 3 On February 28, 1974 the closing rate for the U.S. dollar in the financial franc market was F 4.8250 = US$1; in the official market it was also F 4.8250 = US$1. The dual exchange market regulations are not applicable to the Operations Account countries. 4 Fixed conversion rates in terms of French francs apply to the currencies of the follow- ing countries and territories: the Operations Account countries, the French Overseas Departments, the French Overseas Territories (except the Territory of the Afars and the Issas), and the Condominium of the New Hebrides. (Previ- ously, this was true also for Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia.) These conversion rates have been maintained at pre-Au- gust 15, 1971 levels and are applied irrespective of the nature of payments or receipts. The transactions with foreign countries or nonresidents that are eligible for the official market are essentially (1) all trade transactions (imports, exports, and transit or merchant- ing trade); (2) most current invisibles; (3) the repayment of commercial credit granted or taken up in connection with import, export, or transit trade transactions; (4) current pay- ments made by the French State and French public bodies (collectivites publiques) to nonresidents or made by any resi- dent in favor of foreign states and foreign public bodies; and (5) current payments received by the French State or French public bodies from nonresidents or received by any resident from foreign states and foreign public bodies. All other trans- actions (including all transactions between residents and non- residents in domestic or foreign banknotes or between residents in foreign banknotes) must take place in the finan- cial franc market (but see footnote 2). The transactions channeled through the financial franc market (but see footnote 2) are mainly the following: (1) imports and exports of capital, with the exception of (a) credit 1 In view of certain changes that took place early in 1974 (see note at the end of this survey), this survey presents the position on March 1, 1974. 2 With effect from March 21, 1974 the dual exchange market was abolished. The Treasury Circular of May 5, 1972 concerning the execution of transfers between France and foreign countries through the official exchange market and the financial franc market was revoked. In the remaining circulars issued since August 20, 1971 under Decree No. 67-78 and Decree No. 68-1021, the terms "financial franc market" and "Financial Account in Francs" were replaced by "official exchange market" and "Foreign Account in Francs," respectively. 3 The currencies that are officially quoted are Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Djibouti francs, Italian lire, Mexican pesos, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portu- guese escudos, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, U.S. dollars, and zaires. 4 Countries whose ins t i tu te of issue maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury: Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, People's Republic of the Congo, Dahomey, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Togo, and Upper Volta. 160 granted or taken up on import, export, and transit trade transactions and (b) funds credited or debited by authorized banks acting on behalf of nonresidents to Foreign Accounts in Francs, involving conversion in the official exchange mar- ket; (2) transactions between residents and nonresidents in domestic or foreign banknotes, as well as transactions be- tween residents in foreign banknotes; (3) nonresident trav- elers' purchases of goods and services in France; (4) resi- dents' transfers abroad, free of documentation or authoriza- tion, up to F 1,500 a transfer; and (5) the following current payments (unless made by or in favor of governments or collectivites publiques)'. (a) travel expenditures of residents and nonresidents, other than clearly individualized fares paid by residents; (b) capital service (profits, dividends, interest, am- ortization, and banking commission, except interest, amorti- zation, and banking commission on commercial credits); (c) workers' remittances; (d) certain other payments in the per- sonal sphere (wages and salaries, pensions, family remit- tances, social security premiums and benefits, and alimony); and (e) rentals for the noncommercial use of real estate, ma- chinery, and vehicles. Authorized banks in France and in Monaco, which may also act on behalf of banks established abroad or in Opera- tions Account countries, are permitted to deal spot or for- ward in the official exchange market and the financial franc market in France. Authorized banks may also deal spot and forward with their correspondents in foreign markets in all currencies. Nonbank residents may purchase forward ex- change only in respect of imports and of certain merchanting transactions, but their forward sales of foreign currency are free, whether these represent export proceeds or other re- ceipts. On the import side, forward cover is available for some commodities for 6 to 12 months, and for all others for 3 months. On the export side, an underlying contract is re- quired and cover is available for the full maturity of the export contract or up to 1 month after the date on which the proceeds are collected. France formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from Febru- ary 15, 1961. Exchange Control Territory The exchange control regulations are applicable in all terri- tories of the French Republic except the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas, i.e., in continental France, Corsica, the Overseas Departments (Guadeloupe, Martinique, Gui- ana, and Reunion), and five of the six Overseas Territories (Comoro Islands. St. Pierre and Miquelon, New Caledonia, Wallis and Futuna Islands, and French Polynesia). No ex- change control is applied in relation to the Principality of Monaco or the Operations Account countries (see footnote 4); payments between France and these countries are free of restriction on the French side and take place at fixed exchange rates. All other countries are considered foreign countries for ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution exchange control purposes; 5 all payments between France and foreign countries are subject to exchange control and take place at exchange rates resulting from the dual market regulations. The Condominium of the New Hebrides is con- sidered a foreign country for exchange control purposes. For imports and exports of gold, the Operations Account countries are also considered foreign countries. Certain controls that are independent of the exchange con- trol regulations are maintained over inward and outward direct investment and over borrowing abroad; these transac- tion controls are not applicable to the Operations Account countries or Monaco, and those over direct investment do not apply to member countries of the EEC. Privileged treatment in respect of trade transactions is accorded to (1) the Opera- tions Account countries and (2) Algeria, Guinea, the Khmer Republic, Laos, the Malagasy Republic, Mauritania, Mo- rocco, Tunisia, North Viet-Nam, the Republic of Viet-Nam, and the Condominium of the New Hebrides. 6 Administration of Control The Directorate of the Treasury of the Ministry of Econ- omy and Finance is the coordinating agency in the field of financial relations with foreign countries. It is in charge of exchange control and of all matters relating to inward and outward direct investment and to borrowing abroad, unless these matters relate to real estate companies, when the Bank of France screens applications and notifications. The Direc- torate of the Treasury also evaluates the balance of payments, together with the Bank of France, which collects the data for its compilation. Certain exchange control powers have been delegated to the Bank of France, including the authority to license imports and exports of gold. Other exchange control powers have been delegated to the Directorate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes and in the Overseas Depart- ments and Territories to the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE). The Directorate of Insurance of the Ministry of Economy and Finance has certain powers in respect of matters relating to insurance, reinsurance, annuities, etc. The material execu- tion of all transfers has been delegated to authorized banks and stockbrokers and to the Postal Administration. The Directorate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes estab- lishes import and export procedures and controls, within the framework of commercial policy directives given by the Di- rectorate of Foreign Economic Relations; the Director- ate-General also issues import and export licenses, is responsible for any legal problems arising from the exchange 5 Present French legislation no longer makes reference to the concept French Franc Area. From an exchange control point of view, this Area ceased to exist with effect from January 31, 1967. In the context of countries' overall relations with France, however, the concept survives. In this sense the French Franc Area consists of France and the following countries: (1) the countries of the West African Monetary Union (Dahomey, Ivory Coast, Niger, Senegal, Togo, and Upper Volta); (2) the countries of the Central African Customs and Economic Union (Cameroon, Central African Republic, People's Republic of the Congo, and Gabon) and Chad; (3) three North African countries (Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia); (4) two former Operations Account countries (Malagasy Republic and Mauritania); and (5) one other country (Mali). This broad definition is followed, inter alia, in compiling the balance of payments. In the context of France's monetary relations, the concept of French Franc Area is narrower, excluding the countries of groups (3) and (4). "These countries and territories are listed in Article 86 of an Order of January 30,1967 of the Directorate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes (as amended on February 6 and May 31, 1967). FRANCE regulations, and in particular handles any litigation relating thereto. Technical visas required for certain imports and ex- ports are issued by the competent ministry or by the Director- ate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes. The Ministry of Industrial and Scientific Development has certain responsi- bilities in respect of licensing contracts and contracts relating to technical assistance. Prescription of Currency Settlements with Operations Account countries may be made in French francs or the currency issued by any institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury.7 Settlements with all other countries may be made in any of the currencies of those countries, or, de- pending on the nature of the transaction (but see footnote 2), through nonresident Foreign Accounts in Francs or Finan- cial Accounts in Francs. Settlements with Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia, however, normally take place in French francs only. Importers and exporters are free to invoice in any cur- rency. Nonresident Accounts A nonresident account in francs may be freely opened by an authorized bank for nonresidents, including French na- tionals (other than French officials) who have been residing abroad for at least two years. All overdrafts on nonresi- dent-held franc accounts are subject to general or specific permission. Nonresident accounts are mainly of two kinds: Foreign Accounts in Francs and Financial Accounts in Francs; these are related to the official exchange market and the financial franc market, respectively (but see footnote 2). Foreign Accounts in Francs may be freely credited with (1) the franc proceeds of the spot or forward sale of foreign currencies (but not in banknote form) on the official exchange market by a nonresident; (2) the franc equivalent of an autho- rized bank's arbitrage in foreign currencies on a foreign mar- ket, provided that the regulations of the country concerned allow the transaction; (3) transfers from other Foreign Ac- counts in Francs; and (4) any authorized payment by a resi- dent to a nonresident that is eligible for the official market, including interest on balances in Foreign Accounts in Francs. These accounts may be freely debited for (1) the equivalent in francs of arbitrage abroad in foreign currencies by an au- thorized bank, provided that the regulations of the country concerned allow the transaction; (2) transfers to other For- eign Accounts in Francs; (3) any payment to a resident when the regulations permit the sale of the foreign currency in the official market; and (4) purchases of any foreign currency on the official exchange market by a nonresident. Financial Accounts in Francs may be freely credited with (1) the franc proceeds of foreign currency sold spot or for- ward in the financial franc market by a nonresident; (2) the franc proceeds of the sale of foreign banknotes (not those of the Operations Account countries) to an authorized bank by 7 In addition to the institutes of issue of the Operations Account countries, these are the Institute of Issue of the French Overseas Departments (for Guadeloupe, Martinique, Guiana, and Reunion); the Overseas Institute of Issue (for New Caledonia, French Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna Islands, and St. Pierre and Miquelon); and the Bank of Madagascar and the Comores (for the Comoro Islands). 161 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FRANCE a nonresident; (3) transfers from other Financial Accounts in Francs; (4) liquidation proceeds of nonresident-held direct investments 8 or real estate; (5) French banknotes (and those of the Operations Account countries) mailed direct from abroad to the main office of the Bank of France by an autho- rized bank's foreign correspondents; (6) any payment made by a resident to a nonresident when the regulations permit access to the financial franc market, including interest on balances in Financial Accounts in Francs; (7) the franc equiv- alent of an authorized bank's arbitrage in foreign currency on a foreign market, provided that the regulations of the country concerned allow the transaction; and (8) the sales proceeds, income, and amortization from French and foreign securities held in a foreign dossier in France, including securities accru- ing in France to a nonresident by donation or inheritance. Financial Accounts in Francs may be freely debited for (1) francs purchased against foreign currency by an auth- orized bank in an arbitrage transaction with a foreign market; (2) approved direct investment in France by nonresidents; 8 (3) purchases in France of French or foreign securities; (4) purchases of real estate from residents; (5) transfers to other Financial Accounts in Francs; (6) any payment in favor of a resident when the sale of foreign currency is eligible for the financial franc market; (7) purchases by nonresidents of any foreign currency, including foreign banknotes, on the finan- cial franc market; and (8) French banknotes (and those of Operations Account countries) mailed by authorized banks direct to their foreign correspondents. Direct transfers between Foreign Accounts and Financial Accounts are prohibited (but see footnote 2). Transfers be- tween the two types of accounts may, however, be effected by conversion through spot exchange transactions in the two exchange markets concerned (arbitrage sur les marches des changes). If French francs accruing to a nonresident are not transfer- able, or not immediately transferable, they may be credited to a Suspense Account in francs in the name of the benefi- ciary, balances in which up to F 50,000 are freely transferable. The unremittable funds of emigrants of French nationality, however, must be retained in resident accounts (comptes in- Moreover, licenses may be issued under the compensation transaction procedure, which applies mainly to goods of East- ern European origin. Because of the high degree of import liberalization, imports under this scheme are of slight impor- tance. Payments for imports from foreign countries must be made by credit to a Foreign Account in Francs or with foreign currency purchased in the official exchange market; imports valued at less than F 10,000 may also be paid for through postal channels. Import transactions relating to foreign countries and valued at F 50,000 or more must be domiciled (registered) with an authorized bank, to which the necessary import documents must be presented and through which all payments related to the import must be made. Authorized banks may without special authorization allow advance payments to be made that are provided for in the commercial contract, up to 30 per cent of the price for capital goods and up to 10 per cent for all other goods. Higher advance payments require prior approval by the Customs Administration. For all imports, importers may purchase spot foreign currency one month before the payment falls due (one month before shipment if a documentary credit is opened). There is no restriction on the use of suppliers' credit. The import payment itself can be made as soon as the im- porter can present evidence to his bank of domiciliation that the goods have been dispatched. By virtue of a circular of January 19, 1974 three months' forward cover for import payments can be obtained for any commodity; for the import of specified raw materials and specified foods tuffs (unroasted coffee, corn, rice, etc.) forward cover for six months or one year is available. The foreign currency may be purchased forward at the time of domicilia- tion, but the maturity of the forward exchange contract must not exceed the date on which the commercial payment is due. Payments for Invisibles Payments for current invisibles to foreign countries are controlled but not restricted as to amount. Settlement for most transactions must take place through the official ex- change market (but see footnote 2). If justifying documents are presented and certain exchange control requirements are met, authorized banks are permitted to approve applications for payments without any limitation for many categories of current invisibles, and up to estab- lished limits for certain other categories of current invisibles. Applications for all other payments for invisibles and for amounts in excess of established limits are referred to the Bank of France to prevent unauthorized capital transfers; such applications are approved if a genuine current payment is involved. Any resident may freely and at any time make remittances abroad up to the equivalent of F 1,500 a person without indicating their purpose, provided that the transfers do not constitute installments of payments exceeding F 1,500, are not for purposes subject to special allocation, and do not serve to accumulate funds abroad. Payments which may be authorized without limitation by authorized banks include those related to approved trade FRANCE transactions; income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties; banking commissions, pa- tent fees, and specified categories of taxes; specified insurance payments; fees to medical doctors, lawyers, etc.; alimony in accordance with court decisions; and net salaries or wages of foreigners employed in France, provided that the transfer takes place within three months from the date of payment. Irrespective of the exchange control regulations, certain transactions between persons or firms in France and abroad are subject to restriction; these include certain transactions relating to insurance, reinsurance, and road and river trans- port. The basic exchange allocation for tourist travel to foreign countries by residents (defined for this purpose as including residents of Operations Account countries) is the equivalent of F 5,000 a person a trip, which may be taken up for any number of trips a year. The basic allocation for business travel is the same plus the equivalent of F 500 a person a day. Applications for exchange in excess of the basic allowance for any type of travel are approved by the Bank of France, pro- vided that no capital outflow is involved. Any unutilized foreign currency in excess of the equivalent of F 1,000 must be surrendered upon return to France. Applications for travel exchange cannot be submitted earlier than one month before departure. The use abroad of credit cards issued in France is unrestricted for the settlement of expenditures; in addition, the holder may use them to obtain funds from banks abroad up to F 1,000 a week. All fares for trips starting in France may be paid in francs in France, as may hotel costs and other transportation expenses. Resident travelers going to foreign countries may take out F 5,000 in French banknotes. These banknotes may be spent abroad. Nonresident travelers may take out F 5,000 in French banknotes and may reconvert in the financial franc market into foreign currency any French banknotes up to F 5,000 obtained by the conversion in the financial franc market of foreign means of payment that they declared upon entry or obtained by debit to a Financial Account in Francs; any remaining French banknotes must be deposited with the cus- toms against issuance of a receipt. Resident travelers may freely take out the equivalent of F 5,000 in foreign notes and coins when acquired in the f in- ancial franc market against a tourist travel allocation, or, if they are leaving on a business trip, the equivalent of F 5,000 in foreign banknotes or in checks. Nonresident travelers may not, in principle, take out more than the equivalent of F 5,000 in foreign banknotes unless they were declared upon entry and the annotated declaration form shows that the amount to be taken out does not exceed that imported minus any amounts exchanged for francs plus any reconversion of francs into foreign currencies. However, nonresident travelers may also freely take out any other means of payment established in their name abroad, as well as, subject to the submission of an authorized bank's declaration, any amount in foreign banknotes or foreign currency travelers checks acquired in France from an authorized bank by conversion of foreign exchange in the financial franc market, by debit to a Financial Account in Francs, or by debit to a foreign currency account. 163 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of banknotes and coins (except gold coins) in French francs, CFA francs, CFP francs, or any foreign currency; however, the exchange of banknotes issued by Algeria, Mo- rocco, and Tunisia is prohibited at the request of those countries. Resident travelers must within a month of entry sell in the financial franc market any foreign banknotes or travelers checks in excess of F 1,000 that they bring in. Capital Capital movements between France and Monaco and the Operations Account countries are free of exchange control; capital transfers between France and all other countries are subject to exchange control approval. Most inward and out- ward capital transfers between France and foreign countries (between residents and nonresidents) must be effected through the financial franc market (but see footnote 2). With the exception of purchases of French and foreign securities abroad, outward transfers of resident-owned capital generally are restricted; capital receipts from foreign countries gener- ally are permitted freely, provided that the foreign exchange proceeds are surrendered by sale in the appropriate exchange market (but see below for special controls over borrowing abroad and over inward direct investment). Capital assets abroad of residents are not subject to repatriation. Residents are freely permitted to purchase real estate abroad for per- sonal use as their principal residence, up to F 300,000 a family unit. The transfer abroad of nonresident-owned funds in France, including the sales proceeds of capital assets, is not restricted. French and foreign securities held in France by nonresi- dents can be exported, provided that they have been depos- ited with an authorized bank in a foreign dossier (dossier etranger de valeurs FRANCE Exports and Export Proceeds Certain goods on a prohibited export list may only be exported if a special license is issued. Some other exports also require individual licenses; but if the total value does not exceed F 500, these exports may be permitted without any formality, subject to certain exceptions. Regardless of their value, exports through compensation transactions with cer- tain countries 10 require licenses if the commodities are those for which export licenses are required. Exports to foreign countries are subject to exchange con- trol. Payment must be received through the official exchange market. The repatriation n and, where appropriate, the sur- render in the official market of proceeds from exports to foreign countries is required, normally within one month of the date on which the payment falls due. Authorized banks may freely extend foreign currency advances to exporters; such advances and their repayment are eligible for the official exchange market, as are the proceeds from the discounting of foreign currency drafts presented by exporters. The due date of the commercial contract (and, therefore, the due date of the export receipts) cannot, except with special authorization or when a guarantee by the Compagnie Franchise d'Assurance pour le Commerce Exterieur (COFACE) has been obtained, be more than 180 days after arrival of the goods at their destina- tion. Export proceeds must not be received in French or foreign banknotes or banknotes issued by an institute of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Trea- sury, or by debit to a postal checking account in France. All export transactions relating to foreign countries and valued at F 50,000 or more must be domiciled with an authorized bank; the Director-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes, however, may exempt certain approved firms from domicilia- tion. Certain goods purchased in France by persons not nor- mally residing in France are considered as exports even when paid for in French francs, and are exempt from taxes. Sales to foreign tourists normally are settled through the financial franc market, although the regulations provide for the possi- bility of using the official exchange market if certain special customs requirements are fulfilled. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with Monaco and the Operations Account countries may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be repatriated and, where appropriate, surren- dered, within one month from the due date. Settlement for most types of transactions must take place in the official exchange market (but see footnote 2). With minor exceptions for certain types of transactions, services performed for non- residents do not require licenses. 10 Albania, Bulgaria, People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Egypt, Eastern Germany, Hungary, North Korea, Poland, Romania, Turkey, U.S.S.R., Yugoslavia, and certain Latin American countries. 1 * Repatriation may take place either by collection of foreign currency or by debit to a Foreign Account in Francs. French or foreign securities abroad (whether acquired before November 24, 1968 or later) may freely import them into France and hold them in a foreign dossier, or sell them on a stock exchange in France and repatriate the proceeds through the financial franc market. Special controls (additional to any exchange control re- quirements that may be applicable) are maintained over bor- rowing abroad and over inward and outward direct investment. In principle, these controls relate to the transac- tions themselves, not to payments or receipts. At present, however, their application is in many instances affected by exchange control requirements. With the exception of the controls over capital issues in France, the transaction con- trols do not apply to countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account. Fur- thermore, the transaction controls over direct investment are not applicable to member countries of the EEC, direct invest- ment transactions with which are subject to exchange control declaration and exchange control approval only. Foreign direct investments in France and French direct investments abroad require prior declaration to the Minister of Economy and Finance; in relations with member countries of the EEC, the declaration is required under the exchange control regulations rather than under the special transaction controls, and prior exchange control authorization is required for all direct investment operations liable to involve a capital movement. Direct investments are defined as investments im- plying control of a company or enterprise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 per cent of the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on the stock exchange; any participation in any other type of firm is considered a direct investment. The Directorate of the Treasury, in evaluating the degree of con- trol, takes into account any special relationships resulting from stock options, patents and licenses, commercial con- tracts, etc. Except in respect of EEC countries, the Minister has a period of two months from receipt of the declaration during which he may request the postponement of the projects submitted to him. Unless the amount involved is less than F 1 million, documentary evidence must be submitted to the Directorate of the Treasury before the liquidation pro- ceeds of foreign direct investments in France may be trans- ferred abroad, and the liquidation itself must be reported to the Minister within 20 days after it takes place. As an excep- tion to the declaration and approval requirements summa- rized earlier in this paragraph, the making or the liquidation of direct investments abroad by residents is exempt from prior declaration or prior authorization when the amount involved does not exceed F 1 million a year for each benefi- ciary firm abroad, and provided that the transactions do not involve holding companies, investment companies, invest- ment trusts, unit trusts, mutual funds, or companies whose purpose it is to facilitate the financing or treasury functions of enterprises belonging to one or more groups. Foreign issues on the French capital market are subject to prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. The requirement is applicable also to the Operations Account countries. Exempt from authorization, however, are opera- tions in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from FRANCE the French Government, and (2) shares similar to securities that already are officially quoted on a stock exchange in France. Borrowing abroad by physical or juridical persons, whether public or private persons, whose normal residence or registered office is in France, or by branches or subsidiaries in France of juridical persons whose registered office is abroad, requires prior authorization by the Minister of Econ- omy and Finance. The following types of borrowing are, in principle, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans constituting a direct invest- ment, which are subject to prior declaration, as indicated above, and whose postponement may be requested by the Minister up to two months after receipt of the declaration; (2) borrowing by industrial firms for the execution of works abroad; (3) borrowing by any type of firm to finance imports or exports; (4) loans related to certain international mer- chanting transactions; (5) loans contracted by banks ex- pressly permitted to borrow abroad (these include all authorized banks); and (6) loans other than those mentioned above, when the total amount outstanding of these loans does not exceed F 10 million for any one borrower, provided that the interest rate is a "normal" market rate, that the borrowing is not for the purpose of direct investment, that the foreign exchange proceeds are surrendered, and that each drawing against the loan is separated by at least one year from the corresponding repayment. (However, between July 24, 1970 and the third quarter of 1973 borrowing in francs was re- stricted, the exemptions under (2), (3), (4), and (6) were lim- ited to borrowing in foreign currency, and borrowing in francs by nonbank residents from nonresidents was in effect prohibited. Furthermore, during 1972 and most of 1973 banks and industrial companies were not normally allowed to borrow abroad to finance direct investment in France or abroad.) The application of the controls over direct investment and borrowing is delegated to the Bank of France insofar as they relate to French firms that are mainly engaged in real estate business. Lending abroad is subject only to exchange control autho- rization by the Bank of France, which is given or withheld within the framework of directives issued by the Treasury. Since the imposition of exchange control in 1968, authorized banks have been virtually free to lend foreign currency to nonresidents, subject to certain reservations in respect of the granting of guarantees and varying limitations on their exter- nal position, and to resident importers and exporters. Lend- ing to nonresidents in francs, however, is prohibited, with minor exceptions. Authorized banks' foreign currency assets and their overall liabilities in francs and foreign currency to nonresidents are free from limitation. Authorized banks may freely sell foreign exchange on the official exchange market (as well as the financial franc market) for the account of nonresidents, spot or forward. They are allowed to pay interest on nonresi- dent-owned franc or foreign currency deposits. Nonresi- dent-held franc deposits are not subject to reserve requirements, whether on balances held or on increases therein. 165 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FRANCE Nonresidents may freely purchase French short-term secu- rities, including treasury bills, bons de caisse, and private drafts, through the financial franc market (but see foot- note 2). Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in France. They may continue to hold abroad any gold they held there prior to November 25, 1968. There is a free gold market for bars and coins in Paris, to which resi- dents have free and anonymous access and in which normally no official intervention takes place. Imports and exports of gold into or from the territory of continental France require prior authorization by the Bank of France, which is not nor- mally granted for monetary gold but usually is given for industrial gold. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports and exports of gold addressed to or shipped by the Bank of France; (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles con- taining only a minor quantity of gold, such as gold-tilled and gold-plated articles; (3) imports and exports of gold objects (other than medals, coins, and bars, but including both per- sonal and other jewelry) whose combined weight does not exceed 500 grams; and (4) collectors' items of gold and gold antiques that are exported under "02 licenses" granted with the approval of the Directorate of Museums. Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declara- tion. The import and export of certain gold objects that are considered merchandise, such as gold watches, are subject to both the regular import and export licensing arrangements and to licensing by the Bank of France. Imports and exports of industrial gold are settled in the official exchange market. A 20-franc gold coin, the napoleon, is legal tender but does not circulate. It is actively traded on the Paris stock exchange. In domestic trading, purchases of monetary gold (bars and coins) are not subject to value-added tax. Imports of mone- tary gold are exempt from customs duty and value-added tax. Changes during 1973 January L The CCCE ceased to be the institute of issue for St. Pierre and Miquelon. The French franc replaced the CFA franc as legal tender in St. Pierre and Miquelon. January 1. Upon the accession of Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom to the EEC, imports of additional com- modities were liberalized when originating in these countries. January 3. The restrictions in force since late 1971 on borrowing abroad by banks and industrial or commercial companies to finance direct investment in France or abroad were eased; approvals were now given when such borrowing was intended to finance direct investment abroad and the direct investor did not dispose of, and was unable to raise, sufficient funds either in France or from subsidiaries abroad. January 3. A new Charter for the Bank of France was issued by Law No. 73-7 of the same date. It was comple- mented by Decree No. 73-102 of January 30. Articles 20 through 23 of the Law dealt with the Bank's functions with respect to the foreign exchange market and relations with foreign countries, including the implementation of exchange control. 166 February 1. The official quotation of the Portuguese es- cudo, which had been suspended since 1966, was resumed. February L Imports of additional commodities were liber- alized when originating in Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. February 12. The exchange markets were closed. They re- opened on February 14. February 13. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, France maintained the par value of its currency in terms of gold and continued to avail itself of wider margins. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously F 5.11570 = US$1, became F 4.60414 = US$1. New official buying and selling limits for the U.S. dollar were set at F 4.5005 and F 4.70775. March 2. The exchange markets were closed. They re- opened on March 19. March 13. A new Operations Account Agreement was signed between France and the BEAC, to replace that with the BCEAEC. The BEAC could hold 20 per cent of its exter- nal assets outside the Operations Account, in foreign curren- cies. March 14. The exemption from the mandatory reserve requirements against bank lending already applicable to medium-term and long-term claims on nonresidents was ex- tended to claims resulting from the leasing of French equip- ment to foreign firms outside France. March 16. The Bank of France prohibited banks and other financial institutions from remunerating directly or indirectly any accounts in francs, at sight or with a maturity of up to 180 days, opened for nonresidents. Exempt were (1) physical and juridical persons resident in Operations Account countries; and (2) international organizations, central banks, and foreign public financial institutions (for their balances as of September 30, 1972). (Bank of France Instruction No. 112.) March 16. With effect from March 21, a reserve require- ment of 100 per cent was applied against any increases after January 4, 1973 in nonresidents' demand and time deposits in francs. The minimum reserve requirements on the level of nonresident-owned deposits remained unchanged at 12 per cent for sight liabilities and 6 per cent for savings accounts and time deposits. The same exemptions were given as under Instruction No. 112. (Bank of France Instruction No. 113.) March 16. The net long forward position in foreign curren- cies of resident banks vis-a-vis their foreign correspondents was limited to that of February 28. (Bank of France Circular No. 5 P.B.) March 16. The use of Financial Accounts in Francs for the purchase of French short-term securities (including treasury bills, bons de caisse, and private drafts) and for transfers to savings passbooks was prohibited; exempt were debits up to the amount of wages, salaries, social security payments, and pensions received to the credit of accounts held by nonresi- dent physical persons. There was no de jure prohibition on the acquisition of short-term securities by nonresidents. On March 30, Bank of France Note No. 54 defined short-term securities for these purposes as any security or obligation with 180 days or less to run to maturity. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution March 19. The exchange markets were reopened. France henceforth maintained a maximum margin of 2% per cent for rates in exchange transactions in the official market between the French franc and the Belgian franc, the Danish krone, the deutsche mark, the Luxembourg franc, the Netherlands guil- der, the Norwegian krone, and the Swedish krona. The fixed conversion rates for the currencies of countries and territories of the French Franc Area (see section on Exchange Rate System, above) were maintained, but no announced margins were observed for other currencies. The official limits for the U.S. dollar were suspended. As a result, the French franc began to appreciate in terms of the U.S. dollar. March 27. Decree No. 73-413 abolished the exporters' card, which entitled the holders to special import facilities. March 29. Bank of France Circular No. 193 A.F. in- structed authorized banks not to undertake any new transac- tions (or renew existing ones) that involved the lending of foreign currency in a swap against francs with their private nonresident customers, whether physical or juridical per- sons. (Transactions of the same nature with their foreign correspondents remained subject to Circular No. 5 P.B. of March 16, 1973.) April 1. New monetary cooperation agreements signed on November 23, 1972 between France and the five member countries of the BEAC came into force. April 2. With effect from April 5, authorized banks were allowed to provide forward cover to importers of all com- modities for any period, provided it did not exceed the due date foreseen in the commercial contract. Since February 10, 1972 such cover had been allowed for periods of up to 3, 6, or 12 months, depending on the commodity. April 2. The limitation of export credit to 180 days after the arrival of the goods at their destination (unless a special authorization or a COFACE guarantee was given) was termi- nated. Henceforth, the due date of the export payment was defined as the due date foreseen in the commercial contract, and the latter was not circumscribed. April 2. The banks decided to impose a negative interest charge on new nonresident franc deposits by levying a flat monthly commission of 0.75 per cent on increases in balances over January 4, 1973 levels in the Foreign Accounts and Financial Accounts of certain nonresident nonbank custom- ers. April 5. The exchange rate guarantees for exporters intro- duced on January 31, 1972 were improved. The minimum exchange rate variation covered was reduced from 3 per cent to 2% per cent and the normal minimum maturity of the commercial contract from two years to one year. May 7. Bank of France Circular No. 194 A.F. raised the limit up to which authorized banks could transfer abroad funds as working capital for French firms having tendered for foreign public works or service contracts, to 10 per cent of the value of each contract, but subject to a limit of F 5 million for each contract. July L The Malagasy Republic ceased to maintain an Operations Account with the French Treasury and hence- forth was considered a foreign country for exchange control purposes. French exchange controls and transaction controls became applicable to relations between residents of France or FRANCE the Operations Account countries and residents of the Mala- gasy Republic. July 5. With effect from July 21, reserve requirements on nonresident sight deposits in francs were increased from 12 per cent to 14 per cent, while those on resident deposits were increased from 10 per cent to 12 per cent. (Bank of France Instruction No. 116.) July 9. Mauritania ceased to maintain an Operations Ac- count with the French Treasury and henceforth was consid- ered a foreign country for exchange control purposes. French exchange controls and transaction controls became applica- ble to relations between residents of France or the Operations Account countries and residents of Mauritania. July 11. Bilateral and global quotas for imports of many commodities from "third" countries (non-EEC countries not associated with the EEC) for the second half of 1973 were increased by 20 per cent; licenses for the first half of the year were increased retroactively. (Quota imports from these countries were estimated at the time to be equivalent to about F 3.5 billion a year.) August. Transactions with Morocco and Tunisia ceased to take place at a fixed exchange rate. August 9. The Ministry of Economy and Finance an- nounced a wide range of measures to simplify and liberalize the exchange control regime. The principal measures were (1) The basic travel allocations were increased to F 5,000 a per- son a trip and made uniform for all types of travel (with the exception that for business travel the equivalent of F 500 a day could be taken up in addition to the tourist travel alloca- tion). (2) Hotel and transportation expenses could be settled in France, without limitation, and no longer were charged against the travel allocations. (3) The restrictions on the use of credit cards abroad were removed. (4) The amount of domestic banknotes that residents could take out when trav- eling to countries outside the French Franc Area was in- creased from F 500 to F 5,000 a person a trip. (5) The amount that residents could at any time transfer abroad without indication of purpose was raised from F 1,000 to F 1,500 per transfer. (6) The basic allocation for family remittances was increased from F 1,000 to F 1,500 a donor a month. (7) The basic allocation for purchases of personal real estate abroad (as a principal residence) was raised from F 150,000 to F 300,000 a family unit. (8) The ceiling on gifts between relatives was raised from F 50,000 to F 500,000 a gift. (9) An increased initial allocation of F 20,000 a person was introduced for settling-in expenses of emigrants, and any amount of installation expenses could be transferred upon submission of documents; furthermore, any assets held in France at the time of redesignation as a nonresident, i.e., two years after departure, could be transferred freely. (10) The Bank of France was empowered to authorize freely the trans- fer (through the financial franc market) of nonresident-owned franc assets, up to a ceiling of F 50,000, which had been held in suspense accounts or suspense dossiers pending the grant- ing of a transfer permit, and to authorize individually the transfer of assets of F 50,000 or more. (11) Exports and imports valued at less than F 50,000 (instead of F 10,000 as previously) were exempted from the domiciliation require- 167 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FRANCE ment. (12) The authorization to pay for imports once goods have been dispatched was extended to all transactions, irre- spective of the method of transportation (previously, pay- ments could not normally be made until after the goods had arrived in France). (13) The prohibition on the import or export by mail of bills and drafts by importers and exporters was lifted. (14) Forward cover for imports, previously limited to merchan- dise, was extended to encompass imports of any services (except wages) covered by a contract. (15) Forward cover for exports, previously limited to cases where a contract existed, was extended to include the risks taken by exporters, before the signing of a contract, by commitments made on bids to foreign clients. (16) The renewal of forward cover, previously not allowed, could freely be undertaken for periods of up to three months, and the Bank of France could approve longer extensions. August 27. Bank of France Circular No. 198 defined more precisely the circumstances under which authorized banks could lend foreign currency for the financing of imports and exports. No liberalization measures were involved, foreign currency loans to importers and exporters having been per- mitted since 1968. The existing limits on advance payments for imports (normally 30 per cent for specified capital goods and 10 per cent for all other goods) were maintained. September 20. The financing in francs of nonresidents' real estate operations in France ceased to be required. September 20. The policy of prescribing that in principle inward and outward direct investments should be financed entirely in francs was eased. September 20. The Bank of France requested commercial banks to observe moderation in lending francs to nonresi- dents. The request was withdrawn on September 28. September 21. With effect from October 21, the reserve requirement against resident-owned sight deposits was brought into line with that on nonresident sight deposits, by an increase from 12 per cent to 14 per cent (Bank of France Instruction No. 117). October 5. The restrictions on short-term capital inflows introduced on March 16 were removed: (1) The prohibition on the payment of interest on nonresident franc deposits of less than 180 days was suspended (Bank of France Instruc- tion No. 118). (2) With effect from October 21, the manda- tory reserve requirement of 100 per cent applied to the increase in nonresident franc deposits above their level on January 4, 1973 was abolished. At the same time, the reserve requirement on the level of nonresidents' time deposits was reduced from 6 per cent to 5 per cent, bringing it into line with the requirement on resident-held time deposits (Bank of France Instruction No. 119). (3) Commercial banks were again permitted to undertake transactions which involved the lending of foreign currency in swaps against francs with their private nonresident customers. (4) The instruction by which the net long forward position in foreign currencies of resident banks vis-a-vis their foreign correspondents was limited to that of February 28, 1973 (Bank of France Circular No. 5 P.B.) was revoked. (5) The prohibition on the debiting of Financial Accounts in Francs in respect of nonresidents' pur- chases of French short-term securities was removed. 168 October 8. Authorized banks discontinued the practice started informally in April 1973 of imposing a negative inter- est rate of 0.75 per cent a month on increases in balances over January 4, 1973 levels in the Foreign Accounts and Financial Accounts of certain nonresident nonbank customers. October 19. Restrictions were imposed on exports and re-exports of crude petroleum and petroleum products. November 13. At a conference of members of the French Franc Area it was agreed in principle that the access of the Operations Account countries to the French capital market would be facilitated. November 27. The regulations concerning shipping ac- counts (comptes d'escale) were modified. December 4. New monetary cooperation agreements were signed between France and the six countries of the West African Monetary Union. December 4. A new Operations Account Agreement was signed between France and the BCEAO. The BCEAO could hold 35 per cent of its external assets outside the Operations Account, in foreign currencies. An exchange rate guarantee was given on the BCEAO's creditor balance in the Operations Account. December 14. Bilateral and global import quotas for "third" countries were increased by 50 per cent for the first half of 1974, with certain exceptions for "sensitive items" (ammonium nitrates, gloves, radio and television receivers, and textile products). NOTE.—The following changes took place early in 1974: January 7. It was announced that agencies and enterprises in the energy sector were with immediate effect being allowed to borrow abroad at medium term and long term on the foreign and international capital markets. January 15. With effect from January 21, the remaining reserve requirements against nonresident-owned franc depos- its were rescinded. January 19. It was announced that during the next six months, and on a provisional basis, the interventions of the Exchange Stabilization Fund in the official exchange market would no longer aim at limiting the exchange rates between the franc and certain other currencies within predetermined margins; during this period the monetary authorities would operate the exchange market in an orderly fashion. Restric- tions were being introduced on capital outflows but not on current payments. No changes in the classification of transac- tions between official exchange market and financial franc market were announced. January 20. All lending of francs to nonresidents, whether by banks or nonbanks, was made subject to authorization, and such authorization was not normally granted. Previously, such lending was freely permitted up to periods of two years. January 20. The general permission to authorized banks to credit nonresident franc accounts with the amount of loans in francs granted by residents was revoked. They could still debit such accounts for the repayment of franc loans granted to nonresidents prior to January 20. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution January 20. Forward cover facilities for outgoing payments were again limited to imports and such cover was normally restricted to 3 months, although periods of 6 or 12 months were permitted for specified commodities. January 21. Transactions with Algeria ceased to take place at a fixed exchange rate. January 21. Export credit again was limited, unless special authorization or a COFACE guarantee was obtained, to 6 months after the arrival of the goods at their destination. January 21. The exemption from approval requirements for foreign currency borrowing abroad by nonbank residents was increased from a total indebtedness for each borrower of F 2 million to F 10 million, provided that each drawing against a loan and the corresponding repayment were at least one year apart. January 21. Bank of France Circular No. 200 A.F. speci- fied the types of lending of francs to nonresidents that could still be undertaken by authorized banks. These were (1) franc overdrafts corresponding to normal mail credits (up to ten business days); (2) documentary credits in favor of French exporters, when opened on instructions from banks* foreign correspondents and provided the export transaction was set- tled within 6 months of arrival of the goods; (3) credits within FRANCE the framework of financial protocols signed by the French Government with foreign governments or of inter-bank agreements formally approved by the Treasury; and (4) finan- cial credits in francs granted by French banks to foreign buyers of French capital goods and guaranteed by COFACE. All other franc lending (or renewals of existing franc lending) to banking correspondents or other nonresidents was prohib- ited, including lending of francs to foreign correspondents or customers in the form of swaps of francs against foreign currencies. Banks were instructed to abstain in their relations with nonresidents from any transaction leading to a forward sale of francs by the latter, even an outright sale. January 21. Bank of France Circular No. 201 A.F. permit- ted authorized banks to use their foreign currency holdings for loans to residents covered by the January 20 circular on borrowing abroad, i.e., where such borrowing was permitted without prior authorization. January 31. The Minister of Economy and Finance an- nounced that the French Government would borrow foreign currency equivalent to US$1.5 billion. Subscriptions to the loan were closed on February 4. (On March 7, the Minister stated that French public sector borrowing in the interna- tional capital market would amount to approximately US$3.5 billion in 1974.) 169 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GABON Exchange System No par value for the currency of Gabon has been es- tablished with the Fund. The unit of currency is the CFA Franc,l which is officially maintained at the rate of CFAF 1 = 0.02 French franc. Exchange transactions in French francs, the intervention currency, between the Banque des Etats de 1'Afrique Centrale (BEAC) and commercial banks take place at the rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02, free of commission. Exchange transactions relating to foreign countries, i.e., countries other than France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories except the French Territory of the Afars and Issas), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries of the French Franc Area, take place in a dual exchange market, at rates based on the fixed rate for the French franc and the Paris exchange rate for the foreign currency concerned in either the official exchange market or the financial franc market. Settle- ments eligible for the official exchange market are payments and receipts in respect of imports, exports, and most other current transactions, as well as current payments by or in favor of domestic and foreign public authorities and public bodies. All other settlements with foreign countries, as well as transactions in banknotes of foreign countries and bank- notes issued by the BEAC, take place through the financial franc market at freely fluctuating rates. The principal current payments and receipts channeled through the financial mar- ket are those relating to travel expenses, capital earnings, and workers' remittances. Exchange rates for certain European countries in the official market are based on par values and central rates; the effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar in this market is not confined within any announced margins. With the exception of those relating to gold, Gabon's ex- change control measures do not apply to (1) France (as de- fined above) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Opera- tions Account (Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the People's Republic of the Congo, Dahomey, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Togo, and Upper Volta). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries, except Gabon itself, are considered foreign countries, and in principle financial relations only with for- eign countries are subject to exchange control. Administration of Control The Office of Foreign Financial Relations in the Ministry of Economy and Finance supervises borrowing and lending abroad, the issuing, advertising, or sale of foreign securities in Gabon, and inward and outward direct investment. Ex- change control is administered by the Minister of Economy and Finance, who has delegated his approval authority for current payments to the authorized banks and that with re- spect to the external position of the banks to the BEAC. All 1 The CFA franc circulating in Gabon is issued by the Banque des Etats de rAfrique Centrale (BEAC) and is legal tender also in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, and the People's Republic of the Congo. 170 exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through authorized intermediaries, i.e., the Postal Administration and authorized banks. Import and export licenses are issued by the Directorate of External Trade in the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Prescription of Currency Gabon is an Operations Account country of the French Franc Area, since the BEAC maintains an Operations Ac- count with the French Treasury; settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the other Operations Account countries of the French Franc Area are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Trea- sury. Settlements with all other countries are usually made through correspondent banks in France in any of the curren- cies of those countries or in French francs through Foreign or Financial Accounts in Francs. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. BEAC banknotes may be credited to Financial Accounts in Francs when they have been mailed direct to the BEAC agency in Libreville by au- thorized banks' foreign correspondents. Otherwise, the cred- iting to nonresident accounts of BEAC banknotes, French banknotes, or banknotes issued by any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Trea- sury is prohibited. Imports and Import Payments Some imports are prohibited for security or health reasons. Imports of cement and wheat flour from all sources require special authorization. All other imports from countries in the French Franc Area and from member countries of the EEC other than France may be made freely. All imports from non-EEC countries outside the French Franc Area are sub- ject to licensing in accordance with an annual import pro- gram. This program and the amount of foreign exchange required to implement it are determined by a joint French-Gabonese Committee. A special licensing procedure is applicable to the import of petroleum products. Global quotas are established by commodity groups for imports from all non-EEC countries outside the French Franc Area. The global quotas may be used to import goods originating in any of these countries. All import transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Import licenses entitle importers to purchase the necessary exchange, provided that the shipping documents are submitted to the authorized bank. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Mo- naco, and the other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to approval. For many types of payment the approval authority has been delegated to authorized banks. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted freely when the basic transaction has been approved. For tourist travel, residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the other Oper- ations Account countries of the French Franc Area may obtain an exchange allocation of an amount equivalent to CFAF 200,000 a person a trip (CFAF 100,000 for children under ten) for any number of trips a year; any foreign ex- change remaining after return to Gabon must be surrendered. For business travel to foreign countries, there is a special allocation of the equivalent of CFAF 25,000 a day, subject to a maximum of CFAF 500,000 a trip. Tourist and business travel allocations may not be combined. Travelers going to foreign countries may take out up to a max imum of CFAF 25,000 in BEAC banknotes; the amount taken out is not deducted f rom the travel allocation. Travelers to other countries may take out any amount in BEAC banknotes. Nonresident travelers may take out foreign banknotes and coins up to the amount declared by them on en t ry. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to countries in the French Franc Area are free of license. Exports to other countries require licenses. Un- worked gold and uranium are at present exported only to France. Exporters may obtain import licenses for additional quantities of commodities included in the import program and essential to their export activities, up to an amount corre- sponding to 10 per cent of the total value of their exports during the preceding year. Export transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank. Export proceeds received in currencies other than those of France or an Operations Account country must be surrendered. Export proceeds nor- mally must be received within 180 days after the arrival of the commodities at their destination. The proceeds must be col- lected, and surrendered if received in a foreign currency, within one month of the due date. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services, and all income earned in those countries from for- eign assets must be collected, and if received in foreign cur- rency surrendered, within a month of the due date. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bank- GABON notes and coins issued by the BEAC, the Bank of France, or any other bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign banknotes and coins (except gold coins) of countries outside the French Franc Area. Capital Capital movements between Gabon and France (as defined above), Monaco, and other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require the approval of the Office of Foreign Financial Relations and are restricted, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. All foreign securities, foreign currency, and titles embodying claims on foreign countries or nonresidents that are held in Gabon by residents or nonresidents must be deposited with authorized banks in Gabon. Special controls (additional to any exchange control re- quirements that may be applicable) are maintained over bor- rowing and lending abroad, over inward and outward direct investment, and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Gabon; these controls relate to the transactions themselves, not to payments or receipts. With the exception of those over the sale or introduction of foreign securities in Gabon, the control measures do not apply to France (as defined above), Monaco, and those other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account. Direct investments abroad 2 must be declared to the Minis- try of Economy and Finance, unless they take the form of a capital increase resulting from reinvestment of undistributed profits; the full or partial liquidation of such investments also requires declaration to the Ministry unless the operation in- volves the relinquishing of a participation that had previously been approved as constituting the making of a direct invest- ment abroad. Foreign direct investments in Gabon 3 must be declared to the Minister, unless they take the form of a capital increase resulting from reinvestment of undistributed profits; the Minister has a period of two months from receipt of the declaration during which he may request the postponement of the projects submitted to him. The full or partial liquida- tion of direct investments in Gabon must also be declared to the Ministry unless the operation involves the relinquishing of a participation that had previously been approved as con- stituting the making of a direct investment in Gabon. Both the making and the liquidation of direct investments, whether these are Gabonese investments abroad or foreign invest- ments in Gabon, must be reported to the Minister within 20 days following each operation. Direct investments are defined as investments implying control of a company or enterprise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 per cent in the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. 2 Inc lud ing those made through the intermediary of foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in Gabon and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Gabon. 3 Including those made by companies in Gabon that are directly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in Gabon of foreign companies. 171 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GABON The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign secu- rities in Gabon requires prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. Exempt from authorization, how- ever, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Gabonese Government and (2) shares similar to securities whose issue, advertising, or offering for sale in Gabon has previously been authorized. Borrowing abroad by physical or juridical persons, whether public or private persons, whose normal residence or registered office is in Gabon, or by branches or subsidiaries in Gabon of juridical persons whose registered office is abroad, requires prior authorization by the Minister of Econ- omy and Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans constituting a direct investment abroad for which prior approval has been obtained, as indi- cated above; (2) loans directly connected with the rendering of services abroad by the persons or firms mentioned above, or with the financing of commercial transactions either be- tween Gabon and countries abroad or between foreign countries, in which these persons or firms take part; (3) loans contracted by registered banks; and (4) loans other than those mentioned above, when the total amount outstanding of these loans does not exceed CFAF 50 million for any one borrower. The contracting of loans referred to under (4) that are free of authorization, and each repayment thereon, must be declared to the Office of Foreign Financial Relations within 20 days of the operation, unless the total outstanding amount of all loans contracted abroad by the borrower is CFAF 5 million or less. Lending abroad by physical or juridical persons, whether public or private persons, whose normal residence or regis- tered office is in Gabon, or by branches or subsidiaries in Gabon of juridical persons whose registered office is abroad, requires prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this autho- rization: (1) loans granted by registered banks; (2) other loans, when the total amount outstanding of these loans does not exceed CFAF 50 million for any one lender. The making of loans that are free of authorization, and each repayment thereon, must be declared to the Office of Foreign Financial Relations within 20 days of the operation, except when the total outstanding amount of all loans granted abroad by the lender does not exceed CFAF 5 million. Under the Investment Code of December 4, 1961, as amended on March 23, 1967 and July 9, 1971, any enterprise to be established in Gabon, whether domestic or foreign, is granted, under certain conditions, reduced duties and taxes on specified imports, as well as exemption from direct taxes on specified income. The Code provides for five categories of treatment. Three of these apply to enterprises established in Gabon and whose activity is limited to the national territory of Gabon (catego- ries IA, IB, and II, according to the economic importance of the enterprise). The other types of treatment apply to enter- prises established in Gabon whose market includes the terri- tory of two or more states of the Central African Customs and Economic Union—UDEAC—(categories III and IV, de- pending on the importance of the enterprise). Preferential 172 treatments IA and IB are granted for a period of up to 10 years. Preferential treatment II is reserved for enterprises of prime importance to the country's economic development and involving exceptionally high investments; it provides for stabilization of their fiscal charges for up to 25 years. Prefer- ential treatment HI includes special import privileges and treatment IV includes, in addition to the privileges mentioned above, the advantage of a founding agreement. Requests for approval for preferential treatment must be submitted to the Minister of Economy and Finance, who, after examining the documents, transmits them to the Invest- ment Commission. After an opinion has been given by that Commission, the project is submitted to the Council of Min- isters. Preferential treatments IA, IB, and II are granted by decree issued by the Council of Ministers. Preferential treat- ments III and IV are granted by a certification of the UDEAC upon the recommendation of the Council of Minis- ters. In addition to fiscal privileges, eligible companies may re- ceive protection against foreign competition and may be given priority in the allocation of imports, or public credit, and of government contracts. Non-Gabonese firms or individuals are not permitted to own land in Gabon. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Gabon. Imports and exports of gold require prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. Ex- empt from this requirement are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles). The ex- port of gold is the monopoly of SOGAREM (Societe Gabo- naise de Recherches et Exploitation Minieres). Unworked gold may be exported only to France. Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Changes during 1973 February 13. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the exchange rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02 was maintained; the effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously CFAF 255.785 = US$1, became CFAF 230.207 = US$1. March 19. With the entry into effect of new margins ar- rangements between the French franc and certain other Euro- pean currencies, and the maintenance of the exchange rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02, the CFA franc began to appreciate in terms of the U.S. dollar. April 2. The Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique Equatoriale et du Cameroon (BCEAEC) was replaced by the Banque des Etats de 1'Afrique Centrale (BEAC). July. The exchange control regulations applicable to for- eign countries became applicable also to the Malagasy Re- public and Mauritania. November 1. Gabon ceased to invoke Article XXXV of the GATT with respect to Japan. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution THE GAMBIA Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.426562 gram of fine gold per Gambian Dalasi, corresponding to D 2.08333 = SDR 1. Since June 1972, however, the authorities, while maintaining a fixed rela- tionship between the dalasi and sterling, have not maintained the exchange rate for other currencies within prescribed mar- gins, and therefore all transactions, except those in sterling or currencies maintaining a fixed relationship with sterling, take place at a fluctuating exchange rate. The Central Bank of The Gambia deals only in sterling and charges a commission of yie of 1 per cent for buying, or Y2 of 1 per cent for selling, based on the fixed rate of £ stg. 1 = D 4. The commercial banks deal with customers for spot transactions in sterling at rates within 1 per cent of the Bank's fixed rate and in other currencies at rates determined by the prevailing market rate in London for the currency concerned against sterling. Administration of Control Exchange control policy is made by the Ministry of Fi- nance, Commerce, and Industry. The day-to-day administra- tion of exchange control is carried out by the Central Bank. The commercial banks, which have been appointed as autho- rized dealers, may authorize sales of currencies of countries outside the Sterling Area for imports from outside the Area that are covered by specific licenses and, up to specified amounts, for travel expenses and sundry payments outside the Sterling Area. All other sales of non-Sterling Area curren- cies are subject to the authorization of the Central Bank. The Ministry of Finance, Commerce, and Industry is responsible for the issue of import and export licenses. Prescription of Currency The Gambia has ceased to be a Scheduled Territory in terms of the U.K. Exchange Control Act, 1947 but under current U.K. exchange control regulations continues to be regarded as a country of the Overseas Sterling Area. Settle- ments with other Sterling Area countries may be made and received freely in sterling or in any other Sterling Area cur- rency. Settlements with countries outside the Sterling Area may be made and received in any non-Sterling Area currency other than Rhodesian currency, or in dalasis or sterling from nonresident sources. Nonresident Accounts Banking accounts held by authorized dealers in The Gam- bia on behalf of residents of countries outside the Sterling Area other than Rhodesia may be designated External Ac- counts. These may be credited with authorized payments from residents of the Sterling Area, with transfers from other External Accounts, and with the proceeds of sales of non-Sterling Area currencies. They may be debited for any payments to residents of the Sterling Area, for transfers to other External Accounts, and for purchases of non-Sterling Area currencies. In addition, there is legal provision for au- thorized dealers to maintain Blocked Accounts under the direction of the Central Bank. Imports and Import Payments The import of certain specified goods is prohibited from all sources, predominantly on social, health, and moral grounds. The import from any country of rice and wheat flour is sub- ject to specific licensing in order to ensure the adequacy of such imports and their fair domestic pricing. The Gambia Produce Marketing Board is responsible for rice imports.1 All other imports are freely permitted under an Open General License if imported from the following countries, but are subject to specific licensing if imported from other countries: (1) all countries within the Sterling Area; (2) Austria, Bel- gium, Canada, Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Nor- way, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United States, together with the overseas territories of these countries; and (3) Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Mali, Morocco, Paraguay, Peru, Senegal, the Syr- ian Arab Republic, Thailand, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Yu- goslavia. Imports from Sterling Area countries may be paid for freely in dalasis or in any other currency of the Sterling Area. Settlement for imports from outside the Sterling Area may be approved by an authorized dealer on production of evidence of importation for any commodity that is covered by a valid specific import license. For imports from outside the Sterling Area which do not require specific licensing, payment autho- rization is given by the Central Bank on production of evi- dence of importation or shipment. Advance payments for imports, whether covered by specific licenses or not, are ap- proved by the Central Bank in all cases where the payment is considered genuine and in accordance with the normal practice of the trade. Payments for imports from outside the Sterling Area may be made in dalasis or sterling to an Exter- nal Account or in any non-Sterling Area currency other than Rhodesian currency. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to Sterling Area countries may be made freely. Payments in currencies of countries outside the Sterling Area require permission from the Central Bank ex- cept where authorized dealers have been delegated powers to authorize travel expenses and sundry payments. Such permis- sion by the Central Bank is liberally given in all genuine cases. Irrespective of the purpose of the journey, authorized dealers may authorize a basic exchange allowance up to D 750 for each journey but not exceeding D 1,500 in any one calendar year for travel outside the Sterling Area. For business, profes- sional, or official purposes, authorized dealers may provide residents with exchange facilities up to D 1,750 for any one journey at a rate not exceeding D 125 a day subject to a 1 On February 15, 1974 the National Trading Corporation was established. It started operations on March 1 but was not immediately given an import monopoly over any type of commodity. 173 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution THE GAMBIA maximum of D 3,500 in any one calendar year. Any excess over these allowances requires permission from the Central Bank; all applications are approved, provided that no capital outflow is involved. Of the above amounts, up to D 250 may be taken in currency notes and coins of countries outside the Sterling Area. Irrespective of destination, each traveler leav- ing The Gambia may take out D 75 in Gambian and /or sterling currency notes. Visitors to The Gambia may also take out with them on departure any other currency notes declared by them when entering the country. Exports and Export Proceeds Because of needs for local consumption, the export to any destination of charcoal and firewood is subject to specific licensing, as is the export of all goods to Bulgaria, the Peo- ple's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, the U.S.S.R., and Yugoslavia. The export of all other goods to any other destination is freely permitted under Open General License. Payment for exports to countries outside the Sterling Area must be received within six months from the date of export in a non-Sterling Area currency other than Rhodesian currency or in dalasis or ster- ling from an External Account. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in currencies of countries outside the Sterling Area must be offered for sale to authorized deal- ers. There is no restriction on the import of Gambian or other currency notes. Capital Inward transfers of capital are not controlled. Outward transfers may be effected freely to countries within the Ster- ling Area but are subject to control to countries outside the Sterling Area. At the time of making investments in The Gambia, nonresident investors may apply for an undertaking as to the authorization of applications for the subsequent repatriation of capital; the remittance of profits is freely al- lowed after provision has been made for local taxation. All other applications to transfer capital outside the Sterling Area are dealt with by the Central Bank. Loans and advances by the commercial banks to nonresidents are subject to the au- thorization of the Central Bank; such authorization is nor- mally given freely for the purpose of providing working capital to companies registered outside The Gambia for their operations in The Gambia. Gold The import of gold coins minted in the United Kingdom requires licensing by the Ministry of Finance, Commerce, and Industry; otherwise, gold coins and bullion may be imported freely. All internal dealings in gold and the export of gold require the permission of the Central Bank. Neither the Cen- tral Bank nor the commercial banks deal in gold. Changes during 1973 February 16. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the fixed relation of D 5 = £ stg. 1 was maintained and the dalasi continued to float with sterling. March 19. The fixed relationship of the dalasi to sterling was changed from D 5 = £ stg. 1 to D 4 = £ stg. 1, subject to margins of 1 per cent around the new rate. July 1. The Customs Tariff (Preferential Tariff for Senegal) Order, 1973 came into force. Preferential rates of du ty became applicable to certain imports from Senegal, as set out in Legal Notices Nos. 28 and 33 of 1973. 174 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY 1 Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.242806 gram of fine gold per Deutsche Mark, corresponding to DM 3.66 = SDR 1. A central rate of DM 1 = SDR 0.310580 (DM 3.21979 = SDR 1) has been established, and Germany 2 avails itself of wider margins of 2V4 per cent. Germany maintains a maximum margin of 2Vi per cent for exchange rates in transactions in the market between the deutsche mark and the Belgian franc, the Danish krone, the Luxembourg franc, the Netherlands guilder, the Norwegian krone, and the Swedish krona. No announced margins are observed for other currencies. On March 1, 1974 the closing selling rate for the U.S. dollar in Frankfurt was DM 2.6810 per US$1. Premiums and discounts on forward exchange transactions are normally left to the interplay of market forces. Residents may freely enter into forward ex- change transactions among themselves and with nonresi- dents, irrespective of whether there is an underlying transaction. Germany formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from Febru- ary 15, 1961. Administration of Control The administration of control in Germany in respect of imports and exports of goods and services is operated by the Federal Ministry of Economics, the Federal Ministry of Fi- nance, the Federal Ministry of Transportation, the Federal Office for Trade and Industry (Bundesamt fur gewerbliche Wirtschaft), the Federal Office for Food and Forestry (Bun- desamt fur Ernahmng und Forstwirtschaft), Import and Storage Agencies (Einfuhr- und Vorratsstellen), and the Min- istries of Economics of the Laender. There is no exchange control as such, but Article 23 of the Foreign Trade and Payments Law (Aussenwirtschaftsgesetz) has been invoked to apply direct controls to certain inward capital transactions between residents and nonresidents. 3 The Deutsche Bundesbank, the central bank, is in charge of the implementation of the capital controls. The Bank's prior approval is required for transactions involving the sale by residents to nonresidents of German money market paper and fixed-interest securities of German issuers with a remain- ing maturity of four years or less, for certain other capital transactions between residents and nonresidents, for the payment of interest on nonresident-held deposits in Ger- many (other than nonresident-held savings accounts up to DM 50,000), and for the sale to nonresidents of claims on residents. All banks in Germany are permitted to carry out foreign exchange transactions.

Committee, formulates recommendations with regard to the timing and the terms of domestic and foreign bond issues. Imports and Import Payments The Import List, which is part of the Foreign Trade and Payments Law, comprises a total of 8,384 statistical posi- tions. Their treatment after the publication on January 19, 1974 of the 47th amendment to the Import List is as follows: some 6,500 items may be imported free of license from any country except Rhodesia. Commodities corresponding to some 8,000 positions may be imported free of license from countries in Country Lists A and B only, and commodities covered by 8,300 positions may be imported free of license only from countries in Country List A. 4 Certain petroleum products (7 positions) require a license irrespective of origin. Imports of coal from countries that are not members of the European Coal and Steel Community are permitted within the framework of a global quota of 5.5 million tons a year. Over 1,100 statistical items are covered by the Common Agricul- tural Policy of the EEC; most of these are subject to variable import levies which have in most cases replaced previous barriers to imports, and for some items an import license is still required by EEC regulations. De facto liberalization is applicable to certain commodities (810 statistical items) when originating in and purchased in Albania, Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, Czecho- slovakia, Hungary, North Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Roma- nia, the U.S.S.R., or North Viet-Nam. Under these arrangements, import licenses are issued automatically upon application, provided that domestic production and prices are not affected adversely (AMLA 5 procedure). Imports of 1,500 commodities among those not subject to licensing require an import declaration stamped by the Deut- sche Bundesbank, which serves as documentation. 8 For im- ports still subject to quantitative restriction (with certain exceptions, such as food items imported by tourists, samples, gifts, and small parcels), an individual import license is re- quired. Applications are normally invited by tender (Aus- schreibung) published in the Federal Official Gazette. Import licenses may be allocated to importers either on a first-come, first-served basis, or on the basis of the total value of applica- tions in relation to the quotas established for specified com- modities. Some tenders are permanently open (AMLA procedure). Payments for imports are free, even if the underlying im- port transaction is still restricted. Commodity futures may be dealt in freely. Transit trade transactions may be carried out freely. 4 Countries in List A are those of the former OEEC area; countries in List C are the CMEA countries, People's Republic of China, Cuba, North Korea, and North Viet-Nam; and countries in List B comprise those included neither in List A nor in List C. Lists A and B are contained in the Import List and List C is part of the Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance. Rhodesia is not included in any of the three country lists. 5 Ausschreibungen mil laufender Antragstellung. 6 A different type of import declaration is required for some seven items that have been made subject to special supervision by the EEC. 175 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles may be made freely without individual license, except to Rhodesia. German and foreign notes and coins and other means of payment may be exported freely. The following transactions —but not the related payments —between residents and nonresidents are subject to restric- tion: the chartering of foreign ships from residents of specified countries and the conclusion of sea freight contracts with them; the use of foreign boats in certain inland waterways traff ic; transactions with specified countries (which do not grant reciprocal treatment) for hull and marine liability insur- ance and aviation insurance, except passenger accident insur- ance; the production of motion pictures in association with nonresidents; and certain contracts with nonresidents per- taining to motion-picture f i lm s .7 Exports and Export Proceeds With few exceptions, export transactions may be carried out freely. For all goods, an export notification, for statistical purposes, is required. Certain exports (mostly strategic goods) are subject to individual licensing. A similar system exists for agricultural commodities, but for statistical reasons only. The customs authorities exercise control over export declarations and also check to see whether a license is re- quired. Foreign exchange proceeds from exports do not have to be declared or surrendered, and they may be used for all pay- ments. Claims in excess of DM 20,000 that have been over- due for more than three months and prepayments in excess of DM 10,000 must be reported. Proceeds from Invisibles With few exceptions, services performed for nonresidents do not require licenses. However, licenses are required for transactions related to specific sea services, and for technical assistance through the delivery to residents of List C countries (see footnote 4) of constructional drawings, materi- als, and instructions for manufacture, insofar as such assist- ance is for the production of goods whose export requires a license. There are, in principle, no restrictions on the receipt of payments for services rendered to nonresidents. However, receipts exceeding DM 1,000 on account of services have to be reported. German and foreign notes and coins and other means of payment may be imported freely. Capital Residents and nonresidents may export capital freely with- out a license, except to Rhodesia. Foreign and international bond issues on the German capital market do not require official approval, although a system of voluntary coordina- 7 Restrictions are applied only to the acquisition from nonresidents of rights to films that are to be shown in the original German-speaking version or in a German-synchronized version, the acquisition of rights to films of any kind originating in CMEA countries, and the acceptance of film services from CMEA countries. 176 tion of issuing banks is operated by the Central Capital Mar- ket Committee. Domestic and foreign securities of all types may be imported or exported freely. There are no limitations on the disposal of legacies located in Germany and inherited by nonresidents, or on legacies located abroad and inherited by residents. Residents are not required to repatriate or sur- render their foreign exchange earnings or holdings. Certain types of capital inflows are restricted. The prior approval of the Bundesbank is required for sales to nonresi- dents of all money market paper, of fixed-interest securities of German issuers with four years or less remaining to matu- rity and of claims on residents, as well as for "en pensiort* transactions involving fixed-interest securities of German is- suers with a maturity of four years or less with nonresidents. Licenses are generally issued restrictively. Nonresidents' di- rect investments in Germany, purchases of real estate in Ger- many for personal use, and purchases of German or foreign equities do not require approval. Interest payable to nonresi- dent holders of fixed-interest securities of German issuers is subject to a withholding tax of 25 per cent ("coupon tax"). A cash deposit requirement is applied to certain borrowing by residents from nonresidents. The deposit must be lodged with the Bundesbank in deutsche mark for a period corre- sponding to the duration of the loan and is noninterest bear- ing. The rate of deposit is 20 per cent of the liabilities covered. These are in principle all loans or other credits taken up directly or indirectly from nonresidents; credits for this pur- pose are defined as all transactions and acts that in economic terms represent the taking up of credit. Exemptions from the deposit requirement include (1) an allowance of DM 100,000 for each debtor, by which the monthly average of the liabilities subject to the deposit regu- lations is reduced; (2) an allowance of 20 per cent of the debtor's outstanding export claims, which is reduced by the amount of the exemption under (7) below; (3) liabilities re- sulting from (a) payments terms and credit related to the supply of goods or services by a nonresident to a resident, provided these terms or credits do not exceed six months or, if they are longer, are customary in the trade concerned (or, in the case of credits, were customary up to February 4, 1973), or (b) the acceptance of similarly customary advance payments; (4) liabilities under credits related to certain out- ward direct investment; (5) liabilities resulting from certain debt instruments of types admissible for official listing on a German stock exchange; (6) most types of liabilities of credit institutions, provided they are subject to the Bundesbank's minimum reserve requirements and are either expressly ex- empted from them or are admissible for compensation under those requirements, but not deposit liabilities with maturities of four years or more and certain other liabilities; and (7) liabilities that had arisen before January 1, 1972 and were entered into between January 1,1972 and February 28, 1972, provided they resulted from contracts or transactions con- cluded before January 1, 1972. For the purposes of the cash deposit requirement, German affiliates of nonresidents are considered to be legally indepen- dent and affiliates abroad are considered to be part of the resident company. When credits are renewed, the applicabil- ity of the cash deposit is determined by the renewal dates. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Banks are subject to differential minimum reserve require- ments on the level of their foreign liabilities with maturities of less than four years; the rates of deposit are 35 per cent, 30 per cent, and 25 per cent on demand, time, and savings deposits, respectively. The principal exemption is for banks' foreign currency borrowings that are immediately reinvested abroad. Banks are not normally permitted to pay interest on domestic or foreign currency balances held by nonresidents (other than savings account balances up to DM 50,000 held by nonresident individuals). Gold Residents may freely hold gold in any form at home or abroad and may negotiate gold in any form with residents or nonresidents at home or abroad. There is a free gold market in Frankfurt. Imports require a license from the Federal Of- fice for Trade and Indus try when the gold is purchased in or originates in Rhodesia. With these exceptions, imports and exports by residents and nonresidents of gold in any form are unrestricted and free of license; a customs declaration, how- ever, is required. Imports of unworked gold and gold alloys are free of cus- toms du ty but are subject to value-added tax at a rate of 11 per cent. Imports of monetary gold by the Bundesbank and imports of gold coins that are legal tender, including sover- eigns, are exempt from this tax and from customs du ty; im- ports of other gold coins are subject to value-added tax at a rate of 11 per cent or, where the assessment basis exceeds 250 per cent of the f ine gold value, at a rate of 5.5 per cent. Domestic purchases of gold (alloys and coins that are not legal tender) are subject to value-added tax at a rate of 11 per cent. Commercial imports and exports of articles containing gold are subject to the general foreign trade regulations and in most cases are liberalized. Changes during 1973 January L The import regime applicable to EEC member countries became applicable to Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, except for goods covered by common mar- ket organizations of the EEC, for which this occurred on February 1. January L The 24th Ordinance (of December 6, 1972) amending the Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance came into effect. The exemption from the cash deposit requirement available to each debtor was reduced from DM 500,000 to DM 50,000. Three other exemptions were created or modi- fied. January 1. The Bundesbank made exchange risk insurance for 3 to 24 mon ths available to exporters of goods and certain services. Against a commission of % of 1 per cent, the ex- porter was under certain circumstances guaranteed forward U.S. dollars at the lower intervention point of DM 3.15. To become eligible, the exporter had to undertake neither to take up new foreign credits nor to renew existing foreign liabilities, whether in domestic or foreign currency, other than credits and liabilities expressly exempted from cash deposit. Januarys. Bundesbank Communication No. 7001/73 clar- ified the treatment to be accorded to the acquisition and FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY disposal of domestic bearer and order bonds by domestic affiliates of nonresidents (including branches in Germany of foreign banks). Although under Article 4, Section 1, Para- graph 3, of the Foreign Trade and Payments Law such affili- ates were considered residents if they had their management and their accounting department in Germany, the acts re- ferred to were to be treated as transactions of a nonresident unless they clearly fell within the business field of the resident affiliate. Certain basic rules were given, and these were appli- cable also to transactions in German money market paper. January 25. The Bundesbank revised and standardized its procedures for open market sales of Bundesbank notes ( U-Schatze) to private individuals. As previously, these notes could not be purchased by nonresidents. February 2. The Cabinet announced additional measures against capital inflows, to become effective on February 5 (see below). It also stated that a bill would be introduced to increase the maximum permissible rate of cash deposit from 50 per cent to 100 per cent. (This new authority was enacted on February 22, but by March 1, 1974 had not been invoked.) February 5. The 25th Ordinance (of February 2, 1973) amending the Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance came into force. An authorization from the Bundesbank was re- quired for the following: (1) the acquisition by nonresidents from residents, against payment, of any type of domestic security (excluding "foreign bonds," i.e., bonds of foreign issuers, whether denominated in deutsche mark or foreign currency); (2) the contracting of loans and other credits from nonresidents by residents, including the use of terms of pay- ment in excess of normal commercial practice; and (3) the supply of assets (noncredit transfers in the form of working capital or fixed assets) by nonresidents to enterprises in Ger- many, including the nonresident's affiliates in the territory of the Federal Republic. The principal effect was that sales of German shares and 'Investment certificates" to nonresidents, borrowing by residents from nonresidents, and certain in- ward direct investment operations became subject to ap- proval; for borrowing subject to the cash deposit requirement, such approval was not normally given, and for the other types of transaction approvals were granted restric- tively. The approval requirement for borrowing from nonresi- dents was applicable also to borrowing by banks. The following were exempt from approval: (1) transactions effected after February 4, 1973 which, in the case of credits, did not exceed a total value of DM 50,000 or, in the case of provision with capital assets, did not exceed DM 500,000; (2) the taking up of loans and other credits by banks, insofar as they were covered by the Bundesbank's minimum reserve regulations or (with certain exceptions) expressly exempted from the Bundesbank's minimum reserve requirements or admissible for compensation under these requirements, or related to certain transactions by German subsidiaries abroad, to savings deposits with building societies, or to capi- tal-forming investment by foreign workers in Germany; and (3) the utilization of terms of payment customary in the trade concerned, credits connected with certain deliveries of goods or services with maturities corresponding to terms of pay- ment customary in the trade concerned, and the utilization of 177 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY customary advance payments for deliveries of goods or ser- vices. As regards inward direct investment, the restriction on noncredit transfers was applied mainly to affiliates in Ger- many that were not legally independent and authorization was normally granted except where the operation was consid- ered to involve an inflow of speculative capital. For direct investment in the form of equity participation in a legally independent German affiliate, authorization was given auto- matically when the nonresident firm had a controlling inter- est of at least 25 per cent. Inward commercial credits in excess of the normal terms of payment were restricted, and normally no firm or individual was permitted to borrow from nonresi- dents more than DM 50,000 (counting all credits taken up after February 4, 1973) unless these new borrowings were in the form of liabilities that were exempt from the cash deposit. As regards inward portfolio investment see February 23, below. February 12. The exchange markets were closed. They re- opened on February 14. February 14. A new central rate of DM 2.9003 = US$1 was established. It replaced the central rate of DM 3.2225 = US$1 that had been established on December 21, 1971. The new central rate represented the maintenance of the value of the currency in terms of SDRs. Germany continued to avail itself of wider margins. The official limits for the Italian lira were suspended. The Bundesbank ceased granting ex- change risk insurance at DM 3.1500 per US$1 and did not offer such insurance at lower rates. February 23. An amendment to the Foreign Trade and Payments Law was enacted. The maximum permissible rate of the cash deposit requirement was increased from 50 per cent to 100 per cent, but the Bundesbank did not invoke this authority to increase the ruling 50 per cent rate. The applica- bility of the requirement, previously not expressed in terms of the specific legal form of the borrowing, was explicitly extended to funds received from nonresidents in connection with the issuing, endorsing, or accepting of bills for nonresi- dents. February 23. Sales and purchases of German shares and investment certificates were included in the "nonresidents' quota" arrangements, whereas previously each cred»t institu- tion's "nonresidents' quota" covered only domestic bearer bonds and bonds payable to order (all with a total maturity in excess of four years). In addition, the Bundesbank issued to banks, upon application, separate global authorizations for the use by nonresidents of subscription rights, conversion rights, etc. March 1. The m in inum reserve requirements on the domes- tic liabilities of banks were raised by 15 per cent for sight and time liabilities and by 7.5 per cent for savings deposits. There was no change in the reserve requirements against the level of foreign liabilities (40 per cent for demand deposits, 35 per cent for time deposits, and 30 per cent for savings deposits) and against their growth (60 per cent). The measure was expected to sterilize about DM 5 billion. March 2. The exchange markets were closed. They re- opened on March 19. 178 March 19. A new central rate of DM 1 = SDR 0.294389 was established. March 19. Germany henceforth maintained a maximum margin of 2% per cent for exchange rates in transactions in the market between the deutsche mark and the Belgian franc, the Danish krone, the French franc, the Luxembourg franc, the Netherlands guilder, the Norwegian krone, and the Swed- ish krona. No announced margins were observed for other currencies. The U.S. dollar opened at about DM 2.82. April 4. New procedures were announced for the observa- tion of the development of imports from state trading countries and for the examination of their prices. They re- placed the arrangements of October 23, 1970. April27. The AMLA import procedure applicable to speci- fied state trading countries was extended to imports from the People's Republic of China. May 1. The minimum reserve requirements on banks' for- eign liabilities were tightened. The exemption for banks' for- eign currency liabilities to nonresidents no longer applied to liabilities whose countervalue served to secure claims on affili- ates abroad of resident firms. With effect from May 18, the exemption from the minimum reserve requirements for cred- its taken up abroad by German banks on behalf of their customers to fulfill payments obligations abroad was amended by the deletion of the reference to the customary terms of payment. This was done in the expectation that banks would alert their customers that the credits concerned might be subject to the cash deposit requirement. May 9. A Second Economic Stabilization Program was announced. It included the following provisions directly af- fecting relations with nonresidents: (1) German corporate investments abroad remained exempt from a new 11 per cent tax on corporate investments made after May 9, 1973; (2) existing import restrictions would be relaxed in various ways; and (3) applications for federal export credit guarantees would be examined critically, especially where the proposed terms of payment were unusual. May 19. An agreement concerning the development of eco- nomic, industrial, and technical cooperation was signed with the U.S.S.R. It came into effect immediately. May 23. The 26th Ordinance amending the Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance was issued. The existing exemption from the cash deposit requirement for certain tied financing credits taken up abroad by importers was extended with ef- fect from May 26 to those cases where advance payments to the foreign supplier must be made during the production period, prior to the delivery of goods and related services. The additional exemption was available only where such pay- ments were customary in the trade concerned. A number of formalities for imports and exports were eased with effect from January 1, 1974. June 15. The 27th Ordinance amending the Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance was issued and came into effect immediately. The cession to nonresidents, against payment, of claims on residents became subject to approval by the Bundesbank. Exempt were, inter alia, sales of claims up to DM 50,000 a resident a calendar year. June 20. The degree of import liberalization applicable to most goods when originating in List A or List B countries ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution was extended to the same goods when originating in List C countries. June 22. The Bundesbank henceforth did not authorize foreign borrowing within an exporter's unused "export quota" exemption from the cash deposit requirement unless the loan was denominated in foreign currencies and was ac- companied by foreign currency claims of identical size in respect of goods delivered or services rendered. Previously, firms were also allowed to raise credits in deutsche mark abroad within the quota and in addition it was not necessary for firms to have claims denominated in foreign currency to an equivalent amount. With the new regulation, the only foreign borrowing authorized within the "export quota" was that effected for the purpose of covering exchange risks. June 26. The AMLA import procedure applicable to speci- fied state trading countries was extended to cover imports from Albania, North Korea, Mongolia, and North Viet- Nam. June 26. The Bundesbank decided that with effect from July 1, the reference level for the calculation of the growth of the foreign liabilities of banks was being reduced by 25 per cent. This action was expected to increase the required re- serves by about DM 1.5 billion. June 29. A central rate of DM 1 = SDR 0.310580 (DM 3.21979 = SDR 1) was established. The 2V4 per cent maximum margin between the deutsche mark and the curren- cies of Belgium, Denmark, France, Luxembourg, the Nether- lands, Norway, and Sweden was maintained. As previously, no announced margins were observed for other currencies. The new central rate corresponded nominally to a relation- ship of about DM 2.67 = US$1. July 5. A trade and payments agreement was signed with the People's Republic of China. It came into force immedi- ately. Settlements continued to take place in convertible cur- rencies. July 11. The Bundesbank announced its decision to double its swap line with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to US$2 billion. July 19. The credit institutions were given separate "non- residents' quotas" for equities and for fixed-interest securities, in order to prevent foreign investors from switching out of shares into high-yielding bonds within the previous global quotas and from obtaining additional quotas for the purchase of German bonds by selling German shares acquired on an illegal basis. July 20. The 45th Ordinance amending the Import List was issued. In implementation of the Second Economic Stabili- zation Program, the Government removed with effect from July 21 the approval requirement for the importation of 1,486 industrial items from state trading countries (Country List C). This converted their de facto liberalization (under the AMLA procedure) into dejureliberalization. In addition, the quota limitations on certain other items originating in List C countries, as well as some originating in other countries, were removed (186 items for List C countries) or relaxed (including the quotas for many cotton textiles). July 25. A large number of import items were added to those eligible for the AMLA procedure when originating in FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY and purchased from state trading countries (Country List C). Some further items were added on August 11. July. The import quotas for light heating fuel from Czecho- slovakia, Romania, and the U.S.S.R. were increased by 850,000 tons. August 7. The Bundesbank asked the credit institutions to discontinue the issuing of single "global certificates" (Glo- balurkunden, bonds in collective document form), because their exemption from the 25 per cent "coupon tax" made them attractive to nonresidents and had led to an undesirable in- flow of funds. August 7. The Bundesbank reminded the credit institutions that the following requests made in its letters of July 6 and July 18, 1972 remained in force: (1) to refrain from selling to nonresidents deutsche mark bonds of foreign issuers from the institutions' own portfolios; (2) not to take the initiative to make foreign credits within the exemption (currently DM 50,000) available to residents, or to guarantee such cred- its; and (3) to refrain from helping customers to evade the cash deposit requirement or from recommending transactions implying an inflow of funds from abroad. August 24. The 46th Ordinance amending the Import List was issued. In implementation of its Second Economic Stabi- lization Program, the Government removed the approval re- quirement for the importation of 52 foodstuffs and agricultural items from state trading countries (List C). September 7. A new list of all open tenders under the AMLA procedure was published in the Federal Official Ga- zette. It reflected the dejure liberalization of 1,538 statistical items under the Second Economic Stabilization Program but did not involve any further liberalization measures. September 24. For purposes of the reserve requirements on nonresidents' deposits, the rule that liabilities on letter of credit accounts could be treated as liabilities to residents was amended to the effect that the application of the reserve ratios for residents' funds would only extend to amounts for which the domestic bank had incurred payments obligations (result- ing from irrevocable letters of credit the bank itself had opened or confirmed) and where the crediting of these amounts to the letter of credit cover accounts had been a precondition for the opening or confirmation of the letter of credit. September 24. The 27th Ordinance amending the Export List was issued. Part I of the List was amended in the light of decisions of the international embargo group. On Septem- ber 25 it was announced that for specified items in the List licenses for exports to List C countries could be applied for. October 4. With effect from October 1, the reference level for the calculation of the growth of banks' foreign liabilities subject to additional reserve requirements was reduced by 15 per cent. This measure was expected to neutralize about DM 600 million. With effect from October 5, banks' redis- count quotas were reduced in varying proportions related to their capital and reserves, a measure which was expected to neutralize about DM 1.1 billion. With effect from November 1, the reserve requirements against sight and time liabilities to residents were increased by 3 per cent, which was expected to neutralize about DM 1 billion. 179 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY November 19. The 28th Ordinance amending the Export List was issued. It banned the exportation of crude oil and refined petroleum products with effect from November 27. November 22. It was announced that the increases in im- port quotas for textiles from Asian countries introduced un- der the Second Stabilization Program would not be extended beyond December 31, 1973. The various quota increases for state trading countries would be maintained. December 19. The Government announced a number of economic policy decisions. In view of the changed situation on the foreign exchange markets, a relaxation of the capital controls, in particular to improve import financing, was con- sidered feasible and desirable. Accordingly, the Government had issued the 29th Ordinance amending the Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance (see January 1, 1974, below). NOTE.—The following changes took place early in 1974: January 1. The 29th Ordinance (of December 19, 1973) amending the Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance came into effect. Borrowing from nonresidents by importers to finance imports (including tied finance credits) became ex- empt from approval by the Bundesbank, provided the pay- ments terms did not exceed six months; where the payments terms were in excess of six months, approval ceased to be required, provided that they were customary in the trade concerned or, in the case of credits, were customary up to February 4, 1973. Resident transit traders could freely bor- row from nonresident suppliers (or under tied finance credits, from banks abroad) for periods identical with those for which they extended credit to their nonresident suppliers. Borrow- ing became exempt from cash deposit when it was undertaken for the purpose of equipping a firm abroad in which residents participated, of providing financing to such firms, or of fi- nancing the purchase of real estate abroad. The Bundesbank was authorized to grant a reasonable degree of relief where compliance with the cash deposit requirement would result in undue hardship. January 11. The Bundesbank announced that the reserve requirements against liabilities to nonresidents were being reduced with retroactive effect from January 1, 1974; the reserves on the level of such liabilities were reduced by 5 percentage points to 35 per cent, 30 per cent, and 25 per cent on demand, time, and savings deposits, respectively, while the 60 per cent reserve on the increase of liabilities was abolished. Also with effect from January 1, the reserves on liabilities to residents were reduced by 5 per cent. As a result of these measures, the credit institutions' required reserves were ex- pected to be reduced by about DM 4.5 billion, an amount roughly equal to the outflow of foreign exchange since the beginning of December 1973. The Bundesbank had expressed its agreement in principle with the Government's intention to proceed with a gradual dismantling of the capital controls. January 18. The 30th Ordinance (of January 18, 1974) amending the Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance, the 29th Ordinance amending the Export List, and the 47th Ordi- nance amending the Import List came into force. The first of these regulations did not affect the capital controls, although it modified some reporting requirements with respect to inter- est paid or received by nonresidents. The second related to exports of cocoa and cocoa products to non-EEC countries. The third shifted Finland from Country List B to Country List A. January 21. The official limits for the French franc were suspended. The foreign exchange markets were closed for one day. January 30. The Government decided on a further step-by-step relaxation of the capital controls and issued the 31st Ordinance amending the Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance, which came into effect on February 1 (except for certain changes in reporting requirements, which took effect on March 29, 1974). Approval ceased to be required for borrowing abroad by residents, the acquisition by nonresidents against payment of domestic securities (with the exception of fixed-interest secu- rities with a maturity of four years or less), and inward direct investment. The cash deposit requirement remained in force, but the rate of deposit was reduced from 50 per cent to 20 per cent (by a Bundesbank Order of January 30, effective February 1) and the standard exemption was increased from DM 50,000 to DM 100,000. The reserve requirements on the level of banks' liabilities to nonresidents remained unchanged. The approval require- ment was maintained for the payment of interest on nonresi- dents' deposits with domestic banks, for the acquisition by nonresidents of domestic money market paper, for the acqui- sition by nonresidents of fixed-interest securities with a re- maining maturity of four years or less, for "en pension" transactions with a maturity of four years or less with nonres- idents, and for the acquisition, against payment, of claims on residents by nonresidents (for which the exemption was in- creased to DM 100,000 a resident a calendar year). In order to observe the further development of capital movements, new statistical reporting requirements would be introduced, and in case of need capital restrictions would be reintroduced at short notice. February 11. The Bundesbank revoked its request to credit institutions not to sell their own holdings of "foreign" deut- sche mark bonds to nonresidents. The request to avoid issu- ing "global certificates," however, was maintained. 180 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GHANA Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.450182 gram of fine gold per Gha- naian Cedi, corresponding to £ 1 = SDR 0.506579. Since February 15, 1973, however, the Bank of Ghana has dealt at an official rate of £ 1 = US$0.87, corresponding to £ 1 = SDR 0.71842. The Bank of Ghana quotes rates for the U.S. dollar, sterling, and 14 other currencies;l on December 31, 1973 the Bank's selling rates were 0 2.66 per £ stg. 1 and £ 1.15 per US$1. A d ifferent effective exchange rate arises for certain export proceeds as a result of an export bonus scheme (see section on Exports and Export Proceeds, below). The authorized banks may arrange exchanges of Gha- naian currency for any foreign currency and engage in arbi- trage in all currencies, spot or forward, but they do not maintain foreign exchange balances, receiving their require- ments from the Bank of Ghana on a day-to-day basis. Administration of Control The Controller of Imports and Exports at the Ministry of Trade, Industries, and Tourism is empowered, on behalf of that Ministry, to prohibit, regulate, or license the import and export of all goods. Applications by the industrial sector and certain state agencies for individual import licenses must be channeled through the appropriate ministry or government agency for endorsement. Applications that have been en- dorsed by the competent ministry or agency are then for- warded to the Controller of Imports and Exports at the Ministry of Trade, Industries, and Tourism. Applications by the commercial houses for the import of consumer and invest- ment goods are submitted direct to the Ministry of Trade, Industries, and Tourism. The Controller of Imports and Ex- ports issues import licenses on the basis of an import program drawn up and supervised by the Import Licenses Advisory Committee, on which the Bank of Ghana, various ministries, the army, and the Chamber of Commerce are represented. The Exchange Control Department of the Bank of Ghana administers the allocation of exchange for payments for invis- ibles and capital. Permitted foreign exchange transactions must be made through authorized banks. Prescription of Currency Ghana has ceased to be a Scheduled Territory in terms of the U.K. Exchange Control Act, 1947 but under current U.K. exchange control regulations continues to be regarded as a country of the Overseas Sterling Area. Settlements be- tween residents of Ghana and residents of other Sterling Area countries may be made in cedis through Sterling Area Ac- counts, in sterling, or in other Sterling Area currencies. Au- thorized payments, including payments for imports, by residents of Ghana to residents of countries outside the Ster- ling Area other than Rhodesia may be made in cedis to the credit of a Foreign Account, in sterling to the credit of an 1 Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, CFA francs, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Netherlands guilders, Nigerian niaras, Norwegian kroner, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. External Account, or in any non-Sterling Area currency. Re- ceipts from residents of countries outside the Sterling Area other than Rhodesia may be obtained in cedis from a Foreign Account, in sterling from an External Account, or in any non-Sterling Area currency. However, settlements related to transactions covered by bilateral payments agreements are made through clearing accounts maintained by the Bank of Ghana and /or the central or state banks of the countries concerned. 2 Furthermore, proceeds from exports to nonpay- ments agreement countries must be received in the currency of the importing country (if that currency is among the cur- rencies quoted by the Bank of Ghana) or in U.S. dollars, pounds sterling, or deutsche mark. Nonresident Accounts Accounts in cedis held by residents of countries within the Sterling Area other than Ghana are designated Sterling Area Accounts. These accounts may be credited with authorized payments by residents of Ghana, with transfers from Foreign Accounts and from other Sterling Area Accounts, and with the proceeds from sales of Sterling Area and non-Sterling Area currencies. They may be debited for payments to resi- dents of Sterling Area countries, for transfers to other Ster- ling Area Accounts, and for purchases of Sterling Area currencies. Accounts in new cedis held by residents of countries out- side the Sterling Area other than Rhodesia with authorized banks in Ghana are designated Foreign Accounts. The open- ing of these accounts is subject to approval by the Bank of Ghana. The accounts may be credited with authorized out- ward payments by residents of Sterling Area countries, with transfers from other Foreign Accounts, and with the proceeds from sales of non-Sterling Area currencies other than Rhode- sian currency. They may be debited for inward payments to residents of the Sterling Area, for transfers to other Foreign Accounts, and for purchases of Sterling Area and non-Ster- ling Area currencies other than Rhodesian currency. Nonresident accounts maintained under the provisions of bilateral payments agreements are called "Official Accounts" or 'Territorial Accounts." These accounts may be credited with authorized outward payments by residents of Sterling Area countries, with transfers from Foreign Accounts, with payments received through the Bank of Ghana for settle- ments with bilateral payments agreement countries, and with proceeds from sales of non-Sterling Area currencies other than Rhodesian currency. They may be debited for autho- rized inward payments to residents of Ghana, for transfers to other Official Accounts related to the same country, and for transfers to the related clearing account at the Bank of Ghana. 2 Ghana maintains such agreements with Bulgaria, People's Republic of China, Cuba, Egypt, Guinea, Poland, Romania, U.S.S.R., Upper Volta, and Yugoslavia. The agreements with Cuba and Guinea are at present inoperative. Certain settlements between Ghana and Dahomey are channeled through accounts which the Bank of Ghana and a commercial bank in Dahomey maintain with each other. 181 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GHANA Blocked Accounts are nonresident accounts of another cat- egory, the purpose of which is to receive funds that are not placed at the free disposal of nonresidents, e.g., certain types of capital proceeds. These may be debited for authorized payments, including the purchase of approved securities. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Rhodesia, South Africa, Namibia (South West Africa), and the Portuguese Monetary Area are not permitted. A large part of the import trade is carried out by private importers who must be registered and have to pay a flat registration fee of 0 50 a year. Unregistered importers pay a fee of £ 25 a year which entitles them to import goods on an open general license only. Other imports are made by state agencies. Imports of certain goods also produced in Ghana, certain commodities of a luxury character, and certain goods deemed harmful to health or public order are severely re- stricted. These are specified in a List of Restricted Imports comprising some 90 items and in a List of Banned Imports including some 75 items. Applications for the importation of items on the restricted list may be approved under special circumstances; under no circumstances are applications en- tertained for items on the banned list. Certain basic items such as rice and sugar, which appear on the restricted list, may be imported only by the Logistics Committee (Essential Commodities Committee). There are three open general li- censes which permit any importer to import freely from any country trade samples, personal or household effects, small gifts, single copies of publications, domestic pets, headloads of foodstuffs from neighboring countries, fish caught by Gha- naian-owned vessels, and reimports. All other items require individual licenses, which are of two kinds: specific import licenses and special unnumbered licenses. All goods not cov- ered by an open general license must be covered by a specific license, but where satisfactory evidence can be produced to the effect that payment for such goods has been made and therefore no transfer of foreign exchange is involved, they can be imported under "special unnumbered licenses." Special unnumbered licenses are not normally issued for imports in commercial quantities, though they may occasionally be is- sued to cover commercial imports of nonluxury commodities. They are available only for commodities not covered by any open general license nor by the restricted list or the banned list. Specific import licenses are only issued for items that are considered essential. Except for aid imports or imports under bilateral payments agreements, import licenses do not specify the country from which the commodity has to be imported; they merely specify whether payment is to be made in convertible or inconvertible currency. Licenses are issued on a c. & f. basis and are en- dorsed to the effect that insurance must be covered in Ghana. Exchange for payment of approved imports is granted freely by the Bank of Ghana, but certain arrears exist with respect to matured 180-day trade credits established before February 7, 1972. Importers are required to establish con- firmed letters of credit through Ghanaian commercial banks when placing orders, and virtually all imports are made on a sight basis. Commercial banks usually require importers to 182 make downpayments on the opening of letters of credit for all categories of imports. Banks are forbidden to make payments against a letter of credit or a bank draft unless the import documents include a Clean Report of Findings issued by the General Superintendence Company Limited, a commercial firm which inspects commodities for price, quality, and quan- tity in the country of origin or shipment. Some imports, including rice and sugar, are subject to a sales tax of one pesewa a pound. A graduated license fee is payable on the c.i.f. amount of specific import licenses issued for most commodities. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require specific approval of the Exchange Control Department of the Bank of Ghana, and documentary evidence must support all applications. Certain payments and transfers are in arrears. The following categories of payments are normally autho- rized in connection with the importation of goods: (1) the transfer of normal bank charges payable to overseas bankers for import payments, provided that the amount of the bank charges and the buying commission combined do not exceed 4 per cent of the c.i.f. value of the goods; and (2) the transfer of funds to cover interest on bills up to 6 per cent per annum. The payment of buying commission on imports is not permit- ted. Freight charges must be paid to the local shipping agents; the transfer of funds to cover such charges is normally permit- ted, provided that the applications are properly documented. With few exceptions, insurance on all imports shipped to Ghana on f .o.b. or c. & f. terms must be arranged in Ghanaian currency with local insurance companies. Remittances of income by non-Ghanaian employees are limited to 40 per cent of their net annual earnings, up to a maximum of 0 3,000 a year, and are permitted only to per- sons having an annual disposable income of at least C 1,000; this personal remittance quota is intended to cover all per- sonal and family requirements and commitments outside Ghana, including leave expenses, travel for health purposes, education, gifts, insurance premiums, subscriptions, and do- nations. Remittances of income by non-Ghanaian self-em- ployed persons are also limited to 40 per cent of their net annual earnings, up to a maximum of 0 3,000. Nonresident companies are, with the exception of compa- nies financed with locally raised capital, permitted to transfer abroad freely their net profits after tax; at present, however, profit transfers are being authorized only on a limited basis. The transfer of profits by companies that are either foreign owned or owned or controlled by nonresidents and that have been financed with locally raised capital is not permitted. The basic exchange allocations for tourist and business travel have been suspended. Travel allowances are deter- mined by the Bank of Ghana in the light of the applicant's requirements. Residents of any nationality (except children under two years of age, diplomats, and UN personnel) who, for any purpose, are leaving Ghana by air or sea, whether temporarily or not, must pay a travel tax of 10 per cent of the price of the round-trip ticket. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Resident travelers may be permitted to take with them additional foreign currency equivalent to £ 236.50, provided that not more than the equivalent of 0 47.30 is taken in banknotes in any one currency. Ghanaian banknotes may be taken out by any traveler up to 0 47.30, but may be spent only on Ghanaian aircraft and ships. Nonresident travelers may take out any unutilized foreign currency imported and declared upon entry. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Rhodesia, South Africa, Namibia (South West Africa), and the Portuguese Monetary Area are prohibited. Cocoa and certain other agricultural products are exported through the Cocoa Marketing Board, and diamonds through the Diamond Marketing Corporation. Normally, specific ex- port licenses are required. Exporters are required to collect and repatriate the pro- ceeds from their exports within 60 days of shipment; export proceeds in foreign exchange must be surrendered to a com- mercial bank in Ghana upon receipt. Exporters surrendering export proceeds in external African currencies or convertible currencies may be granted an export bonus of 20 per cent of the cedi equivalent. This bonus is given on all products of Ghanaian origin, other than timber, cocoa and cocoa prod- ucts, and all minerals and primary metals except diamonds bought from local producers; in addition, the bonus is granted on timber and its derivatives and on fabricated met- als, when exported to African countries. Proceeds from Invisibles All receipts from invisibles must be sold to an authorized bank. Foreign currency notes may be imported freely, pro- vided that their exportation is not prohibited by the issuing country. The import of Ghanaian currency notes is prohib- ited, with the exception of the reimportation of notes taken out previously by the same traveler and recorded in his pass- port. Capital Foreign investment in Ghana requires prior approval by the Capital Investment Board in accordance with the Capital Investments Decree, 1973 of January 9, 1973. Certain lines of economic activity are not open to foreigners. Investments approved under the Decree are guaranteed in principle the right to transfer profits and, in the event of sale or liquidation, capital proceeds; tax holidays, initial capital allowances, etc., are also available for such investments. The Decree also stipu- lates that the assets of foreign investors may not be expropri- ated and that, when approved enterprises are nationalized in the public interest, fair compensation is to be determined either by voluntary agreement of the parties or through arbi- tration by the International Center for Settlement of Invest- ment Disputes. All outgoing capital movements must be approved; appli- cations for such transfers must be supported by documentary evidence and are considered on their merits. Transfers to beneficiaries under wills and intestacies are approved, pro- GHANA vided that all local indebtedness has been paid. Requests for the transfer of funds representing personal assets of foreign residents in Ghana who emigrate are considered individually on their merits. Applications must be supported by appropri- ate documentation showing that the savings are genuine and that no illegal transfer of capital is involved. Proceeds from the liquidation of real assets of foreign nationals leaving Ghana may be directed to be reinvested in government bonds or treasury bills; the interest accruing on such investments is transferable. Loan and overdraft facilities to resident companies con- trolled by nonresidents require the individual approval of the central bank. Such companies, when financed with locally raised capital, are not permitted to transfer profits or divi- dends abroad. Residents who are private persons are not normally granted foreign exchange for the acquisition of securities or personal real estate abroad. Transactions in securities are controlled to ensure that capital is not transferred abroad without express permission. In respect of portfolio invest- ments, residents have to obtain approval for any switch in their holdings of securities issued by nonresidents. New bor- rowing abroad is screened by the Permanent Review Com- mittee on Public Agreements, which for private sector borrowing relies on the recommendations of the Bank of Ghana. Private medium-term and short-term import credits in excess of £ 100,000 require approval by the Bank of Ghana. Lending to nonresidents is prohibited, except for ex- port credits; these require exchange control approval and normally are limited to 60 days. Borrowing abroad by com- mercial banks requires the prior approval of the Bank of Ghana. Gold Residents may hold and negotiate in Ghana gold obtained domestically by washing or mining according to indigenous methods, gold coins that are collectors' pieces, and gold jew- elry. Other domestic transactions in gold, as well as imports and exports, may be authorized by the Ministry of Trade, Industries, and Tourism in collaboration with the Bank of Ghana, and certain domestic sales may be carried out by permit under the Gold Mining Products Protection Ordi- nance. With these exceptions, no Ghanaian resident other than an authorized dealer may buy or borrow any gold from, or sell or lend any gold to, any person other than an autho- rized dealer. Imports of gold other than imports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities are not normally licensed; imports for industrial use are very small, a specified commer- cial bank being the sole importer. The import duty on bullion and partly worked gold is 10 per cent, and that on other gold is 50 per cent. The gold mines export their entire output in semirefined form. Exports are free of duties or taxes; the mining corporations are subject to a minerals tax based mainly on profits. Changes during 1973 January 9. The Capital Investments Decree, 1973 was is- sued regulating new private foreign investment in Ghana. The 183 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GHANA Decree repealed the Capital Investments Act, 1963 (Act 172) and the Capital Investments (Amendment) Act, 1965 (Act 267), but provided that agreements previously executed under those acts would continue in force as if made under the De- cree. January 24. With retroactive effect from September 13, 1972, the Export Bonus Decree, 1973 introduced a bonus, payable by the Bank of Ghana or its authorized agents, of 20 per cent of the cedi equivalent of the foreign exchange pro- ceeds from certain exports surrendered to the Bank of Ghana, when accruing in any external African currency or in any external currency "defined by the IMF as convertible in fact." Eligible for the bonus were all products originating in Ghana, with the exception of timber, cocoa and cocoa products, and all minerals and primary metals (other than diamonds bought from local producers). In addition, the bonus would be granted on timber and its derivatives and on fabricated met- als, when exported to African countries. The Foreign Ex- change (Export Bonus) Act, 1971 (Act 357) was repealed. February 1. The Bank of Ghana announced that it would release foreign exchange for the payment of all bills for im- ports and approved service payments not exceeding 0 5,000 in value, in respect of which the cedi counterpart had been paid to the commercial banks on or before February 5, 1972. February 15. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Ghana maintained the value of its currency in terms of gold. The rate for the U.S. dollar, previ- ously £ 1.28 = US$1, became £ 1.15 = US$1. March 21. The Foreign Exchange (Amendment) Decree, 1973 amended the Foreign Exchange Decree, 1972, with re- troactive effect to March 20, 1972. The price paid or to be paid for any exports could not be less than the minimum world market price for the goods concerned, unless the Bank of Ghana directed otherwise. June 1. Documents presented to banks in respect of pay- ments for imports had to include the original copy of the freight receipt, attested by the shipping company. Banks could no longer pay any freight bill not supported by a prop- erly attested receipt from the owners of the carrying vessel. June 4. The Bank of Ghana released foreign exchange for the payment of import bills and approved service payments not exceeding 0 5,000 in value, in respect of which the cedi counterpart had been paid to the commercial banks after February 5, 1972. August 30. A new customs tariff came into force. August 30. The Importers (Regulation and Imposition of Fees) (Amendment) Decree, 1973 came into force. It pro- vided for levies on import licenses granted for specified goods. The 11V2 per cent ad valorem levy applicable to many imports was abolished. September 14. Notice to Importers No. 413 containing the import licensing procedures for 1974 was published. In its main features the notice continued the policy in effect for 1973. September 25. The Ghana National Manganese Corpora- tion was established. It was given a monopoly over the export of manganese ores. October 16. The Bank of Ghana released foreign exchange for settlement of import bills and approved service payments of more than 0 5,000 but not exceeding £ 10,000 in value, in respect of which the cedi counterpart had been paid to the commercial banks on or before February 5, 1972. October 19. With immediate effect, the period for which any existing import license was valid was reduced to one month. On November 22, it was prescribed that in future all specific import licenses should be fully or partially committed within three months from the date of issue. 184 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GREECE Exchange Rate System l The par value is 0.0272838 gram of fine gold per Greek Drachma, corresponding to Dr 32.5714 = SDR 1, and Greece has established a central rate of Dr 30 = US$1, corresponding to Dr 36.1905 = SDR 1. No exchange trans- actions take place at the par value or at the central rate. On December 31, 1973 the Bank of Greece (the central bank) quoted official rates for the U.S. dollar of Dr 29.10 buying and Dr 29.30 selling, per US$1. 2 The intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. Rates for other currencies are determined daily on the basis of the official limits for the U.S. dollar maintained by Greece and the rates for the currencies con- cerned in international markets. The Bank of Greece offers forward exchange cover in U.S. dollars only. Administration of Control Controls are administered on the policy level by the Minis- try of Coordination and Planning and the Currency Commit- tee. Exchange control policy is made by the Currency Committee, the Credit Subcommittee, the Foreign Exchange Control Subcommittee, and the Foreign Exchange Subcom- mittee for Financial Requirements, and import policy is made by the Ministry of Commerce. Exchange control is imple- mented, and import approvals are granted, by the Bank of Greece and authorized commercial banks. Import and export licenses are issued by the Bank of Greece, authorized banks, and the Ministry of Commerce, and, in some cases, require the prior approval of the competent ministry. The authorized banks may make exchange settlements relating to permitted trade transactions and may grant residents a standard travel allowance. All other exchange payments require the approval of the Bank of Greece. Prescription of Currency Settlements with countries with which Greece has bilateral payments agreements3 are made through controlled ac- counts, with the U.S. dollar as the currency of account. Settle- ments with all other countries are made in any convertible currency or through Foreign Sight Deposit Accounts in drachmas. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents are permitted to open with Greek banks con- vertible Foreign Sight Deposit Accounts in drachmas or con- vertible currencies. These accounts may be credited with 1 On January 4,1974 the Bank of Greece changed its buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar to Dr 29.90 and Dr 30.10, respectively. Mn addition to the U.S. dollar, the Bank of Greece maintains official quotations for Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Cyprus pounds, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. It also quotes banknote rates for various foreign currencies. 9 Greece maintains bilateral payments agreements with Albania, Brazil, Bulgaria, People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Egypt, Eastern Ger- many, Hungary, Poland, Romania, U.S.S.R., and Yugoslavia. Most settle- ments with Portugal are channeled through special accounts; balances on these accounts are settled monthly. There is a dormant bilateral account for settlement with Chile of nitrate imports. The agreement with Brazil was terminated with effect from January 31, 1974. convertible foreign exchange or the proceeds from sales of convertible currencies, with authorized payments by residents of Greece for imports or services payable in convertible cur- rencies, and with transfers from other Foreign Sight Deposit Accounts. They may be debited for payments to residents for current transactions, for transfers to other Foreign Sight De- posit Accounts, and for the purchase and transfer abroad of any convertible currency. Any withdrawal from drachma ac- counts for use in Greece and any conversion of foreign ex- change withdrawals into drachmas entail the loss of the reconversion right of the sums withdrawn. The maximum rate of interest on such accounts is 1.50 per cent per annum. Nonresidents may also make time deposits in convertible foreign exchange for a minimum period of 90 days with au- thorized foreign exchange banks; interest rates on the depos- its range between 7.5 and 10.0 per cent per annum, according to their term. Particular regulations apply to nonresident investors (including Greek nationals permanently residing abroad) enjoying the privileges of Legislative Decree No. 2687/53 (see section on Capital, below). They may establish time deposits, for a minimum period of six months and with a minimum deposit in convertible currencies equivalent to US$10,000; balances on these accounts earn interest of 7.0- 8.0 per cent, according to their term, and principal and inter- est are freely transferable at maturity in the currency of the deposit. All drachma assets of nonresidents other than those in Foreign Sight Deposit Accounts must be declared and are held in blocked accounts. Domestic banknotes in excess of Dr 750 brought in by nonresident travelers must also be credited to a blocked account, as must certain income accru- ing in Greece to nonresidents. Subject to the approval of the exchange control authorities, balances on blocked accounts may be used for such purposes as personal expenses in Greece up to Dr 30,000 a visit, purchases of securities officially listed on the stock exchange in Greece, and purchases of real estate in Greece. Amounts of up to Dr 60,000 may be released for remittance by each account holder, provided that the funds were held before December 31, 1963; amounts of up to Dr 30,000 may be released semiannually for remittance by each account holder, from accounts opened after January 1, 1964, provided that the money deposited was derived exclu- sively from rents. Other amounts of balances on blocked accounts may be transferred abroad if the prior approval of the Bank of Greece is obtained. All transfers between blocked accounts require prior approval. Blocked balances may be deposited with a commercial bank, where they earn interest at current rates for sight deposits. Greek citizens (including seamen) who are employed abroad and certain Greek societies and associations operating abroad may establish, with funds originating abroad, con- vertible foreign currency accounts with authorized banks in Greece. Merchant seamen may deposit their wages and sala- ries in these accounts, provided that the funds originate abroad and, if they are received in drachmas, that they are obtained through the intermediary of a shipping firm estab- lished in Greece. Balances on these accounts earn interest at 185 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GREECE 3.0 per cent per annum for sight deposits, up to 10 per cent per annum for time deposits, and 7.0 per cent per annum for savings bank deposits. Balances on these accounts, including accrued interest, are freely convertible into foreign exchange as long as the holder continues to work abroad, or to serve at sea, and for five years thereafter. Somewhat similar facili- ties for foreign currency accounts exist under a Housing Loan Deposit Scheme. Imports and Import Payments Imports of all commodities originating in or shipped from Rhodesia are prohibited. All other imports, except those of goods on Lists F, P, and P-12 with an invoice value c.i.f. of the equivalent of US$100 or less for which payment will be made through an authorized bank, require approval. For most imports, prior approval is required; however, for certain commodities, mainly machinery and raw materials, imports may be effected without prior approval, provided that ap- proval is obtained subsequently. The granting of an import approval implies that appropriate foreign exchange will be made available. Apart from imports for which special licenses are required, two general import procedures (E and D) are applicable to imports, mainly for statistical purposes. Under procedure E, the approval of an authorized bank is required (1) for imports from countries participating in the European Monetary Agreement (EMA) when payment is to be made in a convertible or externally convertible European currency; (2) for imports from Canada or the United States when payment is to be made in free dollars, i.e., not on the basis of procure- ment authorizations under U.S. aid; and (3) for-imports from countries with which Greece has concluded bilateral pay- ments agreements when payment is to be made through the relevant clearing account. No license is necessary under pro- cedure E, but import applications which have been approved by an authorized bank are registered with the Bank of Greece. Under procedure D, an import approval issued by the Bank of Greece is required for imports financed by U.S. aid, for imports other than those covered by procedure E, and for imports for which the importer requests changes in the gen- eral provisions concerning the terms of shipment, method of settlement, terms of payment, etc. Special licenses are required for imports of commodities in List A (including gold, certain luxury items, textiles, automo- biles and parts, and certain foodstuffs) and List B (certain types of machinery and spare parts). For a few items on List A no licenses are being issued. Special regulations govern imports of petroleum products similar to those produced by Greek refineries and imports of certain other items, such as goods under monopoly control, medicines, narcotics, and wheat and flour, sulfur, and motion-picture films, as well as barter transactions based on clearing agreements. For purposes of applying regulations concerning payments for imports and advance deposit requirements, all private imports are classified in nine lists (P, P-12, F, F-50/1-3, and F-100/1-3). Payments for imports may be made by letter of credit, by cash against shipping documents, or by acceptance of time drafts (which is permitted only for goods in Lists P and P-12, there being no time limit for List P but a limit of 186 one year for List P-12 which may be extended for a further six months with the permission of the Bank of Greece). The Ministry of National Economy may authorize longer pay- ment periods and may also approve deferred payments for imports not included in the P Lists. When time drafts are accepted, a personal written undertaking amounting to 4 per cent of the amount of the draft is required as a guarantee that the payment will be made within the prescribed time limits. When a letter of credit is opened, the importer is required to deposit in drachmas the whole amount of the credit with the intervening bank. In addition, for those imports included in Lists F-100/1 and F-100/2, further cash deposits of 40 per cent and 0.8 per cent, respectively, of the c.i.f. value are required as security for import duties and other taxes. For imports under procedure E, this deposit must be made when the import approval is obtained; for imports under procedure D, the deposit must be made within 20 days of the import approval. Advance deposits are not required for imports for which payment is to be made by acceptance of time drafts. When payments for imports are to be made against sight drafts, advance deposits in cash are required for private imports included in Lists F-50/1-3 and F-100/1-3. 4 Advance depos- its are the same for all countries. They are calculated on the c.i.f. invoice value and consist of two components: a prepay- ment required when applying for an import approval and an advance (security) against import duties and other taxes. Se- curity deposits, however, are not required for capital goods and spare parts that are exempt from import duty by virtue of the laws governing investment of foreign or domestic capi- tal. The rates of deposit for each list of imports are set out below. List F-50/1 List F-50/2 List F-50/3 List F-l 00/1 List F-100/2 List F-100/3 P repayment Security In per cent of invoice value 50 20 36 14.4 5 27 100 40 72 28.8 10 4 Total 70 50.4 140 100.8 14 For goods imported and cleared through customs in the Dodecanese Islands, the advance against import duties and other taxes is reduced to one half of the above-mentioned percentages. When imports are financed with U.S. aid funds, a further deposit of 10 per cent must be made in cash or by bank guarantee and in favor of the Greek State, in addition to any deposit as specified above. All deposits must be made with the intervening bank (1) at the time the import approval is obtained, for imports under procedure E, and (2) within 10 days (for Athens and the Piraeus area) or 20 days (for the provinces) of obtaining the import approval, for imports un- der procedure D. Upon delivery of the shipping documents, the importer's bank issues a permit for the customs clearance of the goods, and advance deposits are refunded; however, for 4 Commodities not included in these Lists, or in Lists P, P-12, or F, are subject to the advance deposit requirements applicable to goods in List F-50/3. No advance deposit is required for products in Lists F, P, and P-12. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution goods included in Lists F-50/1-3 and F-100/1-3 the deposits must be retained by the commercial bank for a period of four months from the date on which they were made for a range of specified imports, including fabrics, electrical household appliances, and passenger motor vehicles, and for a period of two months for other imports. Certain companies, public agencies, and organizations that have been designated public service institutions are exempt from the advance deposit requirements. Advance payments may be made to foreign suppliers for all imports against delivery of shipping documents or against a letter of undertaking issued by a foreign bank. Special regula- tions govern imports by state agencies, public entities, and public utility companies. Except for goods in Lists P and P-12, which may be shipped prior to approval, goods must be shipped within six months and arrive in Greece within nine months after the date of import approval. Final settlement of the value of imported goods must take place within 60 days following the date of arrival at the first Greek port; however, settlement must take place within 120 days following the date of arrival for goods in Lists P and P-12. Most imports are subject to a stamp tax of 2-5 per cent of the c.i.f. duty-paid and tax-paid value. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles require approval, but this is granted freely for expenses incidental to authorized trade transactions and for certain other transactions. Residents going abroad for family reasons, tourist travel, or business are entitled to the equivalent of US$250 for one trip a year; instead of this allowance, tourists participating in group tours are granted an amount based on a cost declara- tion submitted by the travel agency. Requests for larger amounts or for other types of travel are submitted to the Foreign Exchange Subcommittee for Financial Require- ments. The committee does not grant additional foreign ex- change for tourist exchange but it normally provides foreign exchange for other travel as follows: up to US$1,500 a trip for exporters, industrialists, and hotel managers; up to US$350 a trip for other businessmen; up to US$500 a trip for newspa- per editors and tourist agents; up to US$800 a trip for scien- tists attending international meetings; and up to US$400 a trip for newspaper reporters. For medical treatment abroad it provides any amount for transfer direct to a foreign hospi- tal, or up to US$1,200 which the patient may take out. It also provides up to US$290 a month for studies in the United States and Canada and up to US$230 a month for studies in other foreign countries (for postgraduate studies, up to US$340 and US$300, respectively). Persons traveling abroad may take with them a maximum of Dr 750 in Greek banknotes. Greek nationals, not including those resident abroad, are required to declare all domestic and foreign banknotes and other valuables taken with them upon leaving Greece. Nonresident travelers on leaving Greece may freely take with them up to US$500 in foreign banknotes declared upon entry, provided that departure is within six months of arrival; the export of larger amounts or any export GREECE after a visit of more than six months is subject to general or specific approval. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Rhodesia are prohibited. All exports require individual licenses, but most exports are free of quantitative limitation. Export proceeds must be surrendered within 180 days from the date of export of the goods; in special cases, however, the authorities are empowered to extend this period up to two years for manufactures and up to one year for other commodities. The Ministry of Commerce may license barter transactions involving the export of tobacco, certain types of fruit, or wines; such transactions are permitted with Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Hungary, Iran, Israel, Poland, Romania, and the U.S.S.R. In addition, any commodity may, subject to individ- ual authorization, be exported on a barter basis to Albania, the People's Republic of China, the Republic of China, and Iran. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts representing payments for services must be surrendered. Exchange proceeds from shipping are exempt from the surrender requirement, but shipowners have to pay for supplies, repairs, etc., and any taxes and fees, and must cover their disbursements and expenses in Greece in local currency obtained through the sale of foreign exchange to the Bank of Greece. Travelers may bring in a maximum of Dr 750 in Greek banknotes. Any surplus is deposited in a blocked account with the Bank of Greece; subject to prior approval by the Bank, the surplus may be taken out on departure or spent in Greece on personal financial requirements. Greek residents returning to Greece must declare the foreign exchange in their possession. Nonresident travelers of foreign nationality may import any amount of foreign currency and need not declare it at the time of entering the country, and nonresidents hold- ing Greek passports are required to declare their foreign ex- change only if they intend, when leaving Greece, to take out again foreign exchange in excess of US$500 or its equivalent. Capital Commercial banks and investment banks may freely bor- row convertible currencies abroad, provided that they lend corresponding amounts as foreign currency loans for periods of at least five years to productive enterprises established in Greece. All other investments in Greece by nonresidents are subject to approval. Such approval is automatic for purchases of real estate for personal use. Under Legislative Decree No. 2687/53, approved foreign investments which aim at the pro- motion of national production or otherwise contribute to the economic advancement of Greece may be granted preferential treatment. 5 Under Law No. 4171/61, as amended by Legis- lative Decree No. 4256/62 and by Legislative Decree No. 916 5 This Decree also provides for the opening of foreign currency accounts by nonresidents and the retransfer of the deposits as well as the transfer of interest thereon. 187 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GREECE of July 14, 1971, further privileges are provided for foreign capital participating in investment projects in Greece exceed- ing Dr 90 million in value. Moreover, Legislative Decree No. 4256/62 provides additional repatriation facilities for foreign investments which promote exports. Repatriation facilities are as follows: (1) Approved invest- ments according to the provisions of the legislation men- tioned above may not be repatriated before one year from the date the enterprise begins to operate productively and in no case before one year from the date the capital was imported. (2) The repatriation of foreign capital may not exceed 10 per cent a year of the amount of capital imported. The repatria- tion of dividends on equity capital and of interest on loan capital may not exceed 12 per cent a year and 10 per cent a year, respectively. (3) Under the provisions of Law No. 4171/61, profits on approved foreign investments may be transferred abroad in amounts not exceeding 6 per cent a year of the repatriated portion of the capital, provided, however, that the amount of profits transferred shall not exceed 8 per cent of the foreign exchange earnings of the enterprise from the sale of its products abroad. (4) For investments made under Legislative Decree No. 2687/53 that are not covered by Law No. 4171/61, the transfer of profits is related to the residual capital remaining in Greece, and the transfer privi- lege expires as soon as all capital has been repatriated. (5) Under the provisions of Legislative Decree No. 4256/62, the repatriation of capital and profits of foreign investments ap- proved under the provisions of Legislative Decree No. 2687/53 can exceed the rates specified in (2) above, up to 70 per cent of the foreign exchange earnings of the enterprise from the sale of its products abroad. Also, foreign loans approved under Legislative Decree No. 2687/53 can be repa- triated at an annual rate of up to 20 per cent, provided that the amount of the loan does not exceed double the value of the share capital and that the amounts repatriated do not exceed 70 per cent of the foreign exchange earnings of the corporation. Deviations from the general regulations may be approved for foreign capital imported to develop exports of agricultural and mining products or invested in enterprises of special importance to the economy. Specified foreign short-term in- vestment may also be granted preferential treatment in re- spect of the repatriation of capital and the transfer of interest. Transfers of capital abroad by residents require approval. The purchase abroad of securities or of real estate for personal use is not normally permitted. Gold Residents may freely purchase specified gold coins (mainly sovereigns) from the Bank of Greece, through licensed stock- brokers, at prices set by the central bank; purchasers must sign a statement to the effect that the coins will only be resold to the Bank of Greece or to licensed stockbrokers. Holders of gold coins acquired in the free market that existed prior to December 22, 1965 may sell these anonymously and without formality only to the Bank of Greece or to an authorized bank and at the official price. Residents may deal freely, however, in bullion. Imports of gold against payment in foreign ex- 188 change are on Import Lists A and F and require a special license issued by the Ministry of Commerce; licenses are nor- mally issued to reputable importers for distribution to recog- nized users, such as jewelers and dentists. Gold bars and gold coins may be imported freely by commercial banks and other residents as well as nonresidents when no payment in foreign exchange is involved. Exports of gold other than by the Bank of Greece are not approved with the exception that gold bars or coins brought in by travelers and declared upon entry may, with the prior approval of the Bank's Credit Subcommittee, be re-exported by the same person. Changes during 1973 During the year, permitted interest rates on foreign cur- rency deposits held in Greece were increased on several occa- sions. February 14. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Greece established a central rate of Dr 30 = US$1. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar remained unchanged. The Bank of Greece main- tained the previous official buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar, i.e., Dr 29.90 and Dr 30.10. April 26. The Currency Committee announced that the creation of a forward exchange market was under consider- ation. May 23. Bilateral payments arrangements with the Peo- ple's Republic of China came into force. July 10. Exports of cotton seed, cotton seed cake, and linseed were suspended. August 1.

October 19. It was announced that Greece would not for the time being ensure that the rates for the drachma would be kept within the margins hitherto observed between the drachma and other currencies. October 19. It was announced that imports would be liber- alized further and that import formalities would be simplified. October 20. The Bank of Greece set new buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar, initially at Dr 26.90 and Dr 27.10, respectively. Subsequently these rates were changed on a number of occasions. November 1.

Not for Redistribution GUATEMALA Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.736662 gram of fine gold per Guatema- lan Quetzal, corresponding to Q 1.20635 = SDR 1 or Q 1.00 = US$1. The official rates are Q 1.00 buying, and Q 1.01 selling, per US$1. The Bank of Guatemala quotes exchange rates for certain other currencies 1 on the basis of their rates in the New York market. On January 27, 1947, Guatemala notified the Fund that it was prepared to formally accept the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control There is no exchange control but all inward and outward transfers are recorded for statistical purposes by the Bank of Guatemala (Exchange Department) under the direction of the Monetary Board. Foreign exchange transactions of the public sector are carried out exclusively through the Bank of Guatemala; those of the private sector are carried out through the medium of authorized banks for the account of the Mone- tary Stabilization Fund maintained by the Bank of Guate- mala. Import and export licenses are issued by the Ministry of Economy. Prescription of Currency All exchange transactions must be carried out through banks. Payments to Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua in respect of trade and invisibles are normally settled in Guatemalan quetzales through the Camara de Compensation Centroamericana, a clearinghouse established by the central banks of Central America to foster the process of economic integration of their countries. The Exchange Department of the Bank of Guatemala, however, is empow- ered to authorize the sale of currencies of other Central Ame- rican countries to travelers within the area. There are no obligations prescribing the currency for payments to and from other countries. Imports and Import Payments Import licenses are not required except for imports of maps of Guatemala, explosives, poultry, wheat flour, and used trucks and trailers. Imports of coffee beans, coffee plants, soluble coffee, and tallow are prohibited. There are no restric- tions on the availability of foreign exchange for permitted imports. A surcharge of 100 per cent of the customs duty is applied to those products originating in or imported from countries with which Guatemala has an unfavorable trade balance that are not covered by the common external tariff of the Central American Common Market (i.e., goods whose import taxa- tion has not yet been subject to equiparaciori). This surcharge is waived if the goods are transported in Guatemalan ships. Moreover, all imports from other areas which are included in 1 Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, and Swiss francs. 190 the agreed uniform tariff list of the countries participating in the General Treaty for Central American Economic Integra- tion are exempt from the surcharge. Imports originating outside the Central American Com- mon Market or in Honduras are subject to an import sur- charge of 30 per cent of the applicable import duty. Payments for Invisibles These are not restricted. Remittances of rents, interest, royalties, commissions, and professional fees are subject to a tax of 11 per cent and remittances of profits and dividends to a tax of 10 per cent. All international air passages (with the exception of those for travel within Central America) are subject to a tax of 10 per cent. The export of Guatemalan banknotes and coins is not prohibited and there are no regula- tions prohibiting the export of foreign banknotes. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of certain foodstuffs and a few other items are subject to licensing which serves to safeguard domestic supplies. The proceeds of exports are not subject to exchange control. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange proceeds from invisibles are not subject to exchange control. The import of Guatemalan and foreign banknotes is not restricted. The purchase of Salvadoran banknotes by authorized banks is limited to £ 500 a person. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on inward or outward capital transfers by residents or nonresidents. All investment by foreign or foreign-controlled companies in the construction of private housing in Guatemala requires the prior approval of the Ministry of Economy; such investment may be limited to a specified overall amount a year, it must meet certain minimum quality and financing standards, and the sales value of a housing unit must not exceed Q 6,000. Gold Residents must sell to the Bank of Guatemala any gold in their possession. Residents other than banks may sell gold coins and gold bars only to the Bank of Guatemala or to banks licensed for this purpose by the Monetary Board. The Bank of Guatemala is obliged to purchase all gold offered to it. The Bank also sells domestic and imported gold to domes- tic artistic and industrial users, in accordance with directives of the Monetary Board. Gold is imported only by the Bank of Guatemala. When selling such gold, the Bank charges its c.i.f. import price plus a 1 per cent commission and a 1 % per cent stamp tax. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GUATEMALA Changes during 1973 January 15. By virtue of Monetary Board Resolution No. 7338 of January 12, 1973 all restrictions on the sale of foreign exchange for current payments were eliminated. Previously, the principal limitations on sales for such payments related to travel, student expenses, family remittances, savings from salaries and wages, and income from assets held in Guatemala (other than foreign investments). January 26. Exports of cottonseed, cottonseed meal, and cotton cake became subject to licensing. February 1. By virtue of Monetary Board Resolution No. 7338 (see above) exchange control was abolished. The re- maining restrictions on capital transfers were terminated. A system of statistical recording of external settlements was substituted. The existing regulations concerning gold were maintained. February 10. A trade agreement was concluded with Hon- duras providing for reciprocal duty free treatment. February 13. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the exchange rate of Q 1 = US$1 was maintained unchanged. The official buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar also remained unchanged. July 20. Decree No. 28-73 modified the application of the 10 per cent tax on international air passages. September 4. Exports of cattle hides and skins became subject to licensing. October 18. The par value was changed from 0.818513 gram to 0.736662 gram of fine gold per quetzal.

Not for Redistribution GUINEA Exchange Rate System No par value for the currency of the Republic of Guinea has been established with the Fund. The unit of currency is the Syli, defined as a monetary unit containing 0.036 gram of fine gold. This corresponds to GS 24.6853 = SDR 1. On December 31, 1973, the rate maintained by Guinea for the U.S. dollar was GS 20.462 = US$1, subject to commissions; all transactions under bilateral payments agreements were settled at GS 20.46 = US$1, and the official buying and selling rates for banknotes were GS 18.80 and GS 22.50, respectively, per U.S. dollar. Administration of Control Exchange control authority is vested in the Central Bank of the Republic of Guinea. The Bank has not delegated any of its exchange control powers to any other bank or institu- tion. The Presidency is charged with supervision over the Central Bank. All settlements with foreign countries, includ- ing payments for imports, require approval by the Exchange Control Office. Import and export licenses are issued, within the frame- work of an annual program, by the Ministry of Foreign Trade after applications have been screened by the National Licens- ing Commission. Prescription of Currency Settlements on account of transactions covered by bilateral payments agreements are made in currencies prescribed by, and through accounts established under, the provisions of the agreements. * Settlements with other countries are made in designated "convertible" currencies. 2 Nonresident Accounts There are two types of nonresident accounts: Nonresident Transferable Accounts in Foreign Currencies and Nonresi- dent Accounts in Sylis. The opening of a nonresident account is subject to the prior approval of the Exchange Control Office. Imports and Import Payments All imports, other than those under the Seven-Year Plan, require individual licenses, which are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Trade, after applications have been screened and approved by the National Licensing Commission. Once an import license has been issued, authorization for the corre- sponding payment is granted by the Exchange Control Office. 1 Guinea maintains bilateral payments agreements with Algeria, Bulgaria, People's Republic of China, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Egypt. Ghana, Hungary, Lebanon, Morocco, Poland, Romania, Senegal, Sierra Leone, U.S.S.R., and North Vict-Nam. There is also a compensation arrangement with a private firm established in Switzerland. Some of the agreements are inoperative. (Furthermore, agreements negotiated with Alba- nia, Cameroon, North Korea, and Liberia have never come into force.) 2 Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, CFA francs, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Libyan dinars, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. 192 Imports by foreign concession holders require import licenses for statistical purposes only and are not restricted. Most imports into Guinea are made within the framework of an annual import program. This program is prepared by the Ministry of Foreign Trade on the basis of the country's import needs, the domestic production possibilities of import substitutes, and experience with the previous year's import program. The program requires the approval of the National Licensing Commission, which takes into consideration the sources of imports and the availability of convertible curren- cies and of balances under payments agreements. Certain items are imported outside the import program. These are goods for which foreign exchange is derived from sources other than the exchange reserves of Guinea—e.g., imports made by foreign concession holders (the "mixed economy companies" and the Sifra Company) and by foreign embassies—and goods for the Seven-Year Plan. All commer- cial imports other than those by the "mixed economy compa- nies" and the Sifra Company are made by state enterprises that specialize in the various types of commerce. All commodities are subject to import surcharges, except when imported by the "mixed economy companies." Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require the authorization of the Exchange Control Office, irrespective of the country to which the payment is to be made. Payments for freight and insurance in connection with im- ports are authorized as part of the import license. No ex- change is granted for other types of insurance with companies abroad. There is no basic allocation for tourist or business travel; each application is considered individually. Govern- ment officials on official missions are permitted an allowance of GS 350 a day. Pilgrims are granted exchange up to the equivalent of GS 6,000 for each pilgrimage and, in addition, up to GS 19,000 to pay for fares connected with the pilgrim- age. In cases of serious illness, provided that a doctor's certifi- cate is submitted, residents are granted foreign exchange for medical care abroad or are permitted to transfer exchange for the care of relatives receiving medical treatment abroad. Indi- vidual authorization is required for the payment in Guinea of all fares for foreign travel. Payments for family support may be made up to monthly amounts determined on the merits of the case. For officially recognized study abroad, the student's parents may transfer the equivalent of the amount of a government scholarship, i.e., GS 2,250 a month. Students beginning their studies abroad are granted an additional foreign exchange allowance of up to GS 4,000. The Foreign Investment Law guarantees that at least 20 per cent of the net annual profits of approved foreign investments may be transferred abroad; the percent- age actually permitted to be transferred abroad depends on the agreement concluded between the enterprise concerned and the Government. Expatriate workers employed by the public sector in Guinea may transfer abroad 40 per cent of their net monthly salaries and those employed by the private ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution sector are permitted to transfer up to 30 per cent of their net monthly salaries. The export of Guinean currency is prohib- ited. Exports and Export Proceeds The Ministry of Foreign Trade establishes an annual ex- port program, which requires the approval of the National Licensing Commission. All exports require individual licenses in order (1) to assure the implementation of the export program (particularly in respect of commitments under bilateral trade agreements); (2) to permit the Treasury to levy certain duties (e.g., mining companies must pay export taxes of 6 per cent on the value of ores exported); (3) to prevent shortages of goods needed for domestic consumption; and (4) to prevent the export of capi- tal. Special authorization from designated agencies is required in addition to the export license for the following commodi- ties: wild animals (dead or alive), edible animals, articles of historical or ethnographical interest, jewelry, articles made of precious metals, and plants and seeds. An export license is granted only when the exporter assumes the obligation to surrender the proceeds immediately after they are collected. Exports other than those effected by the "mixed economy companies" are made by three state enterprises: Prominex, Proseco, and Frutex. Foreign planters are granted special transfer privileges related to the quantity of pineapples, ba- nanas, or citrus fruits exported. All export proceeds must be surrendered; however, the Friguia Company and the Sifra Company are allowed to retain 66% per cent and 25 per cent, respectively, of their export earnings, and private traders may also be permitted to retain a part of their export proceeds in order to finance authorized imports. GUINEA unless evidence can be produced to show that actual expendi- ture was less. The import of Guinean currency is prohibited. Capital All capital transfers require authorization. Outward capital transfers by Guinean nationals are prohibited. The Foreign Investment Law (Law No. 50/AN/62) of April 5, 1962, which replaced a more restrictive one of May 1960, provides guarantees against the nationalization of for- eign investments in the industrial and mining sectors; it also provides for preferential tax and customs treatment applica- ble to foreign investments and for the transfer of profits, interest, amortization, and liquidation proceeds of such in- vestments. Small and medium-sized enterprises in which at least GS 15 million is invested over a 3-year period may receive tax exemptions for a period of 7 to 10 years; exemp- tions for up to 25 years may be granted on long-term invest- ments of particular importance to the Guinean economy. The actual conditions under which foreign investments may be made are subject to negotiations within the terms of this law. Gold Guinea has issued four commemorative gold coins which are legal tender. Furthermore, residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Guinea for numismatic purposes. With these exceptions, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Central Bank; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. Proceeds from Invisibles Changes during 1973 Exchange proceeds accruing to residents in respect of invis- ibles must be surrendered. The import of foreign banknotes and travelers checks is permitted freely, subject to declaration on entry, but both must in principle be surrendered within 24 hours after entry. Nonresident travelers may repurchase and re-export the foreign exchange declared upon entry, after deduction of their local expenditures; this deduction cannot be less than the equivalent of US$20 for each day of their stay, February 13. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Guinea maintained the gold con- tent of the syli unchanged. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously GS 22.736 = US$1, became GS 20.463 = US$1. The buying and selling rates for U.S. dollar banknotes, previously GS 20.90 and GS 24.60 per U.S. dollar, were changed to GS 18.80 and GS 22.50 per U.S. dollar. 193 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution GUYANA Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.409256 gram of fine gold per Guyana Dollar, corresponding to GS2.17143 = SDR 1, and Guyana avails itself of wider margins. Since June 23,1972 the effective parity relationship for sterling has been maintained at GS5.2114 = £ stg. 1. Consequently, all transactions, except those in sterling or currencies maintaining a fixed relationship with sterling, take place at fluctuating exchange rates. The Bank of Guyana normally deals only in Barbados dollars, Canadian dollars, East Caribbean dollars, Jamaica dollars, pounds sterling, Trinidad and Tobago dollars, and U.S. dol- lars. On December 31, 1973, its buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were G$2.24197 and GS2.25418 and those for sterling were GS5.2081 and GS5.2342. In its dealings in Canadian dollars, pounds sterling, and U.S. dollars with commercial banks, the Bank of Guyana charges a commission of V16 of 1 per cent on inward transfers and 7/i6 of 1 per cent on outward transfers; it charges a com- mission of V8 of 1 per cent, buying and selling, in dealings in Barbados dollars, East Caribbean dollars, Jamaica dollars, and Trinidad and Tobago dollars. The commercial banks' charges for Canadian dollars, pounds sterling, and U.S. dol- lars are %6 of 1 per cent buying and % of 1 per cent selling. Their buying and selling rates for Barbados dollars, East Caribbean dollars, Jamaica dollars, and Trinidad and Tobago dollars are ities from all sources (including coffee, cereals, and dairy products) and over all imports from the state trading countries mentioned. Certain foodstuffs may be imported only by the Guyana Marketing Corporation. For certain gar- ments, the open general license is not applicable to Japan. Payments for authorized imports are permitted upon appli- cation and submission of the necessary documentary evi- dence. Exchange control forms have to be completed for all transactions exceeding GS240. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to all countries require approval, which, except for amounts in excess of the standard allocation for tourism, is given freely, provided that no illegal capital transfer seems to be involved. Standard allocations are ap- plied to certain payments of a personal nature on an annual basis, e.g., for tourist travel abroad (GS666, which may be accumulated up to G$2,000 for any three-year period), for education at schools abroad (G$3,360 for each child), for education at universities and comparable institutions (G$4,800 for each student), and for family maintenance (G$4,800 for each family). 4 Resident and nonresident travel- ers are subject on departure to an exit tax of G$3 a person. Travelers going abroad may take with them Guyana cur- rency notes not exceeding GSIOO; these notes do not form part of any allotment of exchange for travel. 5 In addition, foreign currency notes up to the value of G$50 may be taken out as part of any travel exchange allowance. Nonresident travelers may within one month from their last entry take out any foreign currency notes declared upon entry. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. Exports of rice may only be made by the Guyana Rice Marketing Board. Most exports are free of export li- cense, but are supervised by the Bank of Guyana and the Customs and Excise Department to ensure that the exchange proceeds are repatriated and, if obtained in listed specified currencies (see footnote 1) surrendered. 8 Exchange control forms have to be completed for all exports exceeding G$2,000 in value. Proceeds from Invisibles Specified currencies (see footnote 1) received on account of invisibles must be sold to an authorized bank, but other currencies may be retained by the recipient. Travelers may bring in freely any amount in Guyana currency notes and foreign banknotes (see footnote 5). 4 With effect from January 17, 1974 the standard allowance for tourist travel was reduced to G$333 a person a year (or G$ 1,000 every three years), and on January 24 this allowance was suspended for the time being. 5 With effect from January 24, 1974 the importation and exportation of currency notes which are or were at some time legal tender in Guyana were prohibited, with the exception that travelers were permitted to take out, and bring in on return, Guyana currency notes not exceeding G$ 15. 8 On January 25, 1974 exports of sugar to the United Kingdom were suspended. GUYANA Capital Foreign investors must obtain from the Bank of Guyana "approved status" for new investments at the time of invest- ment in order to be able to repatriate capital. Such approval is normally given for direct investments in new projects that would benefit the balance of payments or the economy of Guyana; it carries with it an assurance that profits may be remitted and that upon liquidation of the investment, the proceeds, including any capital increments after payment of all taxes, may be repatriated in full in the currency of the original investment.7 The export of capital by residents is not normally permit- ted. Listed specified currencies (see footnote 1) obtained by residents through capital transactions must be surrendered to an authorized bank, but other currencies may be retained by the recipient. Emigrants of Guyanese nationality may transfer abroad up to G$24,000 of their capital assets, viz., G$ 12,000 at the time of emigration and G$4,000 in each of the following three calendar years. Any remaining capital proceeds must be re- tained in Guyana indefinitely, but the funds are not directed into Blocked Accounts. 8 Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Guyana for numismatic purposes. Residents other than the monetary au- thorities, authorized dealers, producers of gold, and autho- rized industrial users are not allowed without special permission to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry or coins for numismatic purposes, at home or abroad. Neither the Bank of Guyana nor any other official institution purchases gold to supply domestic industry. Imports and exports of gold in any form require licenses issued by the Ministry of Finance; such licenses are not granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authori- ties, authorized dealers, producers of gold, and industrial users. Changes during 1973 January 16. The buying and selling rates for the Jamaica dollar quoted by the Bank of Guyana henceforth were based on the prevailing sterling/U.S. dollar rate; previously, fixed rates were quoted. February 20. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, it was decided that the Guyana dollar would continue to float with sterling, the effective parity relationship for which remained unchanged at GS5.2114 = £ s t g. 1. July 10. Additional commodities became subject to indi- vidual import licenses. Further commodities were added on July 21 and 31. 7 With effect from January 24, 1974 foreign-based companies—other than those based in the CARICOM area—and their subsidiaries were until further notice prohibited from borrowing in Guyana and from exporting depreciation allowances. 8 With effect from January 17, 1974 the settling-in allowances granted to emigrating Guyanese nationals out of declared capital assets in Guyana were suspended until further notice. The suspension applied to new as well as previous emigrants. Emigration allowances for nonnationals were spread over a longer period of time. 195 ©International Monetary Fund.

Not for Redistribution HAITI Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.147332 gram of fine gold per Haitian Gourde, corresponding to G 6.03176 = SDR 1 or G 5.00 = US$1, and Haiti does not avail itself of wider margins. The par value is applicable to all transactions. The intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. In addition to the gourde, the U.S. dollar is legal tender. On December 22, 1953, Haiti notified the Fund that it was prepared to formally accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control There is no exchange control law, and no obligations pre- scribing the method or currency for payments to or from nonresidents are imposed. Exchange regulations are issued by the National Bank of the Republic of Haiti and are imple- mented by that Bank and five commercial banks, the only other banks operating in the exchange field. The banks review certain requests for foreign exchange to ascertain that no unauthorized capital transfers are involved. Imports and Import Payments Although the law provides for the imposition of quantita- tive restrictions on imports, import licenses are not required. Imports from member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and Japan, however, require prior au- thorization by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The Ministry's prior authorization is also required for imports from any source of certain types of footwear and of a few other items that are controlled for other than balance of payments reasons. The domestic marketing of certain imports is controlled by the State Tobacco Monopoly. Importers opening letters of credit at the National Bank are usually required to make cash deposits of up to 100 per cent of the amount of the letter of credit. Certain imports are subject, in addition to the applicable import du ty, to surcharges of 4, 5, or 6 per cent of the c.i.f. value; goods subject to the 4 per cent or 6 per cent tax are also subject to an additional tax of 2 per cent. Importers must also pay an "economic liberation tax" levied on the amount of the customs invoice; when this amount exceeds G 10,000, the tax is 1 per cent. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports except coffee require prior authorization from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Export authoriza- tion is usually granted freely but may be withheld when do- mestic supplies are low. Exports of essential oils are shipped by the Association of Haitian Exporters of Essential Oils. Gold coins, bullion, etc., may be exported only by the Na- tional Bank. The proceeds of exports are not subject to ex- change control. Exporters must pay an "economic liberation tax" levied on the amount of the customs invoice; when this amount exceeds G 10,000, the tax is 1 per cent. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments for invisibles are not restricted. No exchange control requirements are applied to proceeds from invisibles. A regulation which is not enforced prohibits the export and import of U.S. banknotes in denominations of over $20. Resi- dents traveling abroad must pay a tax of G 20 on tickets to a destination in the Caribbean area and G 50 on tickets to a destination outside that area; diplomats and staff of interna- tional organizations are exempt. Capital Except in special circumstances, capital transfers abroad are not permitted. Imports of capital may, however, be made freely. Residents may hold capital assets abroad in any form other than gold. Foreign investment in Haiti is regulated by a law of 1949 and a decree of March 13, 1963 and requires government approval. Permission is not usually granted to nonresidents for investments in handicraft industries. Under a decree of April 6, 1973, private banks operating in Haiti are required to keep in the form of domestic assets a minimum of 85 per cent of deposits collected from residents of Haiti. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Haiti for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. By virtue of a law of August 31, 1942, the National Bank has the exclusive right to purchase domestically and export gold in the form of coins, mineral, dust, or bars. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry carried as personal effects by travelers may be made only by the National Bank; exports require in addition prior authorization by the Ministry of Finance, while imports for industrial use require prior authorization by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Ministry of Finance as well as an endorsement by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry before customs clearance. However, commercial im- ports of articles containing a limited amount of gold, such as gold watches, are freely permitted and do not require an import license or other authorization. Five gold coins were issued in 1967 and sold mostly to nonresidents; these coins are legal tender. Changes during 1973 February 20. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, a central rate of G 5.00 = US$1 197 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution HAITI was established. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar remained unchanged. April 6. A decree was issued increasing from 80 per cent to 85 per cent the amount of deposits collected from residents that private banks must keep in the form of domestic assets. October 26. The par value was changed from 0.163703 gram of fine gold to 0.147332 gram of fine gold per gourde. The new par value corresponded to the central rate. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar remained un- changed at G 5.00 = US$1. 198 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution HONDURAS Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.368331 gram of fine gold per Honduran Lempira, corresponding to L 2.41270 = SDR 1 or L 2.00 = US$1. The official rates are L 2.00 buying, and L 2.02 selling, per US$1. Banknotes in Costa Rican colones, Guate- malan quetzales, Nicaraguan cordobas, and Salvadoran colo- nes are purchased at parity rates minus an official exchange commission of 1 per cent and sold at parity rates. Honduras has no exchange restrictions on foreign payments. Exchange may be purchased from local banks without restrictions; however, for statistical purposes, buyers are required to file an application stating how the exchange will be used. Earners of foreign exchange wishing to negotiate the exchange in Honduras may do so only with the Central Bank of Honduras or through the banking system for account of the Central Bank. On August 19, 1950, Honduras formally notified the Fund that it had assumed the obligations of Article VIII, Sec- tions 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, beginning on July 1, 1950. Prescription of Currency No obligations prescribing the method of currency for pay- ments to or from nonresidents are imposed. Payments to Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua in re- spect of trade and invisibles may be settled in Honduran lempiras through the Camara de Compensation Cen- troamericana, a clearinghouse established by the central banks of Central America to foster the process of economic integration of their countries. Payments to Mexico may also be settled in Honduran lempiras through the clearinghouse. Imports and Import Payments Import licenses are required for a few items. Payments and transfers abroad may be made freely; however, for statistical purposes, buyers of exchange are required to file an applica- tion stating how the exchange will be used. Certain imports require prior Central Bank approval when they are to be made on credit terms, and certain other imports are subject to this requirement irrespective of the terms of payment. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports other than gold do not require licenses. The pro- ceeds of exports are not subject to exchange control, and the foreign exchange may be retained or used for international transactions. Exports of coffee are supervised by the Hondu- ran Coffee Institute. Those wishing to negotiate their ex- change in Honduras may do so only with the Central Bank or through the banking system for account of the Central Bank. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles These are not restricted. Capital Capital payments are not subject to exchange control. However, by virtue of Decree No. 73 of October 30, 1969, the authorization of the Minister of Economy and Finance is required for all activities implying the transfer abroad of capital. Foreign mutual funds and similar financial institu- tions require permission to collect funds in Honduras for deposit or investment abroad. The approval of the Ministry of Finance, the Council of Economic Planning, and the Cen- tral Bank is required to contract any foreign indebtedness, whether for import financing or other purposes, and the for- eign liabilities of the banking system are subject to ceilings. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Honduras for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Central Bank; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, industrial users, and producers of gold. All lo- cally produced gold is exported in the form of ore for refining. Commercial imports and exports of jewelry and other articles containing gold require licenses issued by the Ministry of Economy; for most articles, these are granted freely. Changes during 1973 February 10. A free trade agreement was signed with Gua- temala. February 15. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the exchange rate of L 2.00 = US$1 was maintained unchanged. May 26. A free trade agreement was signed with Costa Rica. October 19. The par value was changed from 0.409256 gram to 0.368331 gram of fine gold per lempira, correspond- ing to L 2.41270 = SDR 1.

Not for Redistribution HONG KONG 1 '2 Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.146631 gram of fine gold per Hong Kong Dollar. The central rate is HK$5.0850 per US$1, correspond- ing to HK$6.13431 = SDR 1, and Hong Kong avails itself of wider margins, the official limits being HKS4.9706 and HK$5.1994 per US$1. On January 1,1974, the banks' buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were HK$5.0650 and HK$5.1050, respectively. Administration of Control There is no exchange control. Import and export licensing is carried out by the Director of Commerce and Industry. Prescription of Currency The Colony of Hong Kong is part of the Sterling Area, although it has ceased to be a Scheduled Territory in terms of the U.K. Exchange Control Act, 1947. No prescription of currency requirements are in force; settlements between resi- dents of Hong Kong and nonresidents may be made and received freely in Hong Kong dollars or any other currency. Nonresident Accounts The treatment of nonresident accounts does not distinguish between those of residents of other parts of the Sterling Area and those of nonresidents outside the Sterling Area. Imports and Import Payments Except for certain dutiable or dangerous commodities, im- ports are free of license. However, all goods originating in or shipped from Rhodesia require an import license. All imports must be declared to the Department of Commerce and Indus- try. Payments for permitted imports may be made freely, at any time and in any currency. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to any destination of plastic raw materials and certain strategic goods are subject to restrictive licensing; textiles are also subject to licensing because of a number of bilateral agreements with specified countries under which the export of certain textiles is restricted. All exports must be declared to the Department of Commerce and Industry, which is also the export licensing authority. Export proceeds may be collected at any time and in any currency. They need not be repatriated or surrendered. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles There are no limitations on payments for or receipts from 1 Hong Kong is a nonmetropolitan territory in respect of which the United Kingdom has accepted the Fund's Articles of Agreement. 2 In view of changes that took place on January 1, 1974 (see note at the end of this survey), this survey presents the position on that date. invisibles. Resident and nonresident travelers may freely bring in and take out any amount in domestic or foreign banknotes, travelers checks, and other means of payment. Capital ' No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or payments by residents or nonresidents. Gold There is a free market for gold in which dealings by resi- dents and nonresidents are unrestricted. Imports and exports of gold in any form (including finished jewelry) are freely permitted and do not require licenses. Residents may hold gold in any form in Hong Kong or abroad. Changes during 1973 January 1. Exchange control was abolished. The distinc- tion between authorized banks and nonauthorized banks was terminated. All exchange control circulars were canceled and the use of exchange control forms E.C. 15 and E 2 was ended. Banks were asked to continue to cooperate in providing sta- tistical information, particularly with respect to their posi- tions in foreign currencies. Furthermore, until September 1973 banks were requested to consult the Exchange Control Office before running any position in foreign currencies other than sterling beyond those limits agreed under previous ar- rangements; banks remained free, however, to increase or decrease their sterling holdings. February 14. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, it was announced that the value of the Hong Kong dollar was being maintained in terms of gold. The central rate in terms of U.S. dollars, previously HK$5.6500 = US$1, became HK$5.0850 = US$1, and Hong Kong continued to avail itself of wider margins. The upper limit for the U.S. dollar became HK$4.9706 and the lower limit HK$5.1994. September 24. Banks became free to run positions in any currency without consultation. NOTE.—The following changes took place on January 1, 1974: January 1. The export of plastic raw materials required a license. January 1. The Import and Export (General) Regulations (Amendment of First and Second Schedules) Order 1973 came into force. Licenses ceased to be required for the import of gold and diamonds and for the export of gold, diamonds, and currency notes and coins. 200 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ICELAND Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.00830471 gram of fine gold per Icelandic Krona, corresponding to IKr 107.008 = SDR 1. A central rate has been established of 0.00792269 gram of fine gold per Icelandic krona, which corresponds to IKr 112.168 = SDR 1. No exchange transactions take place at the par value or the central rate, since no announced margins are being observed for the time being. The official rates on Decem- ber 31,1973 were IKr 83.60 buying and IKr 84.00 selling, per US$1. Rates for other currencies are based on the official rates for the U.S. dollar and the dollar rates for the currencies concerned in international markets. Rates for settlements through the clearing account with the U.S.S.R. are fixed; the buying and selling rates maintained for clearing kronur by the Central Bank of Iceland on December 31, 1973 were IKr 0.9986 and IKr 1.0014, respectively. The authorized banks are permitted to carry out exchange transactions among themselves and to engage in arbitrage in foreign mar- kets. Administration of Control The Ministry of Commerce, after consulting the Central Bank, has the ultimate decision on matters concerning import and export licensing and on payments for invisibles. The Central Bank of Iceland is responsible for the regulation of foreign exchange transactions and of exchange control, in- cluding capital controls, and for ensuring that all foreign exchange due to residents is surrendered to authorized banks and that such exchange is disposed of as authorized. The two largest commercial banks, the National Bank of Iceland and the Fisheries Bank, are the only authorized banks. The autho- rized banks issue import and exchange licenses in consulta- tion with the Ministry of Commerce. Export licenses are issued by the Ministry of Commerce. Prescription of Currency Iceland has ceased to be a Scheduled Territory in terms of the U.K. Exchange Control Act, 1947 but under current U.K. exchange control regulations continues to be regarded as a country of the Overseas Sterling Area. Iceland maintains a bilateral payments agreement with the U.S.S.R., and all settlements with that country must be made exclusively through a clearing account denominated in kronur. As a general rule, exchange receipts from other countries must be obtained in convertible currencies. In practice, settlements with countries in the dollar area and with Brazil are made in U.S. dollars; with countries in the Sterling Area and some other countries, in sterling; and with certain other countries, in their respective currencies. Nonresident Accounts There are two categories of nonresident kronur accounts: Foreign Accounts and Special Accounts. The opening of non- resident accounts requires individual approval. Foreign Accounts may be credited with the proceeds from the sale of foreign currency to authorized banks and with authorized payments due to nonresidents from residents. Bal- ances on Foreign Accounts may be used freely for payments to residents and may without a license be converted into the currency of the country of residence of the account holder. These accounts are in practice seldom used, payments for international transactions generally being made in U.S. dol- lars, sterling, or other convertible currencies. Special Accounts in kronur or foreign currency may be opened by agreement with an authorized bank. The most important of these accounts are those of foreign banks and foreign insurance companies. They may be credited freely, up to certain limits, with approved payments from residents. Imports and Import Payments All goods not included in the restricted list or subject to state trading (see below) may be imported freely (and, with minor exceptions, without an import license) from any coun- try; * about 93 per cent of total imports (1972 basis) is liberal- ized. Some 30 commodities or groups of commodities are included in the restricted list and are subject to quantitative restriction. Some of these commodities are admitted, subject to individual license, under seven global quotas (1973) that apply to all countries with which Iceland does not maintain bilateral payments agreements. 2 The remaining goods on the restricted list are admitted from the same countries on the basis of individual licenses issued on a discretionary basis ("other licensing"). The principal items involved are gasoline, gas oil, and fuel oil; they are imported mainly from the U.S.S.R. All goods on the restricted list require individual licenses when imported from bilateral payments agreement countries; licenses in this case are in principle issued in accor- dance with bilaterally agreed quotas, but in practice they are granted freely upon application for global quota items. Cer- tain imports are admitted only under state trading; these include fertilizers, tobacco, matches, and alcoholic beverages. Furthermore, fresh vegetables and potatoes are imported un- der the auspices of the Agricultural Production Board in accordance with a government authorization. None of these commodities, however, is subject to quantitative restriction. For imports from all sources, when requiring a license, a fee of V2 of 1 per cent (minimum IKr 10.00) is charged as a license fee on the krona amount of the import license when the license is issued; for petroleum products, however, this fee is 0.1 per cent. The commercial banks normally require cer- tain advance deposits in connection with import transactions. Importers of goods not requiring licenses do not have to obtain a foreign exchange permit prior to shipment from abroad, provided that the purchase is payable at sight. On the other hand, the goods will not be cleared by the customs unless payment has already been made or the importer has arranged with an authorized bank for payment. An importer 1 The liberalized commodities include agricultural commodities that are purchased from the United States under P.L. 480 agreements (at the end of 1973 no such agreement was in force). In order to ensure the implementation of the agreement, the authorized banks are empowered to control the foreign exchange allocations for purchases of these commodities. 2 For these goods, moreover, additional licenses may be applied for outside the global quotas. 201 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ICELAND may either open a letter of credit or obtain a payment certifi- cate which enables him at any time to buy foreign exchange to pay for the goods. For imports that require individual licenses, foreign exchange is granted in accordance with the terms stipulated in the license. Importers may freely accept suppliers' credit for up to three months from the date of arrival at an Icelandic port for listed goods corresponding to some 70 per cent of 1970 imports; the goods not listed are mainly building materials and nonessen- tial goods (including motor vehicles for personal use). Credit in excess of 3 months and not exceeding 12 months requires permission by an authorized bank and the Ministry of Com- merce. Foreign credit in excess of 12 months is subject to government authorization. Imports from all sources of motor vehicles and motorcycles are subject to an import surcharge of 25 per cent ad valorem; the surcharge is 15 per cent, however, for buses and heavy trucks, and ambulances and certain other utility vehicles are exempt. Payments for Invisibles No exchange license is required for government payments (such as interest and amortization on external loans, expenses of the foreign service, payments to international organiza- tions, payments for postal, telegraphic, and telephone ser- vices), for banking commissions, or for bank charges on foreign exchange transactions. Most other outgoing payments are licensed freely on the basis of bona fide documents. The basic allocation for tourist travel is the equivalent of IKr 25,000 (about US$300) a per- son for one trip a year (IKr 12,500 for children): if a second trip is made in the same calendar year, an additional alloca- tion of 50 per cent of the basic allocation is granted. Applica- tions for exchange for major repair of ships, repair of means of transport other than ships and aircraft, transactions and transfers in connection with direct insurance, and insurance business operations abroad are considered on their merits. The chartering of foreign ships usually is not allowed when Icelandic vessels are available for charter on normal terms. Resident and nonresident travelers may take out up to IKr 1,500 in Icelandic banknotes and coins, in denominations not exceeding IKr 100. Nonresident travelers may re-export any foreign exchange they brought in upon entry. Exports and Export Proceeds All commercial exports require licenses. The shipping doc- uments must be lodged with an authorized bank. Exchange receipts accruing from exports must be surrendered without undue delay. All fish products are subject to export levies. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles must be surrendered without undue delay. The owners of Icelandic ships and air- craft are, with the approval of the authorized banks, permit- ted to retain their foreign exchange receipts from freight, passenger tickets, or other charges, and to use them for oper- ating purposes and for purchases of necessities for the home- 202 ward journey of the ship or aircraft. Icelandic insurance com- panies which reinsure abroad are permitted to retain foreign exchange earned from premiums and indemnities and to use it to pay reinsurance premiums, claims, and other regular expenditures of the insurance business in the country where the foreign exchange was earned. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in up to IKr 1,500 in Icelandic banknotes and coins, in denominations not exceeding IKr 100. There are no limitations on the import of foreign banknotes and coins. Capital All investments by nonresidents in Iceland are subject to individual approval. The participation by nonresidents in Ice- land's joint stock companies may not exceed 49 per cent, and is not allowed in the fishing industry. Nonresident-owned foreign capital entering in the form of foreign exchange must be surrendered. Nonresidents may be authorized to open non- resident accounts for these funds, in which case their retrans- fer abroad may be permitted. Residents are obliged to surrender foreign exchange accru- ing to them on account of capital transactions and payments. Without the approval of the Government, residents may not obtain loans abroad, including loans for financing imports, for periods exceeding one year. Applications for the contract- ing of financial credits and loans abroad for a period of less than one year are considered on their merits and approved only in exceptional circumstances. The contracting of com- mercial credits abroad for a period of between 3 and 12 months is also approved only in exceptional circumstances, e.g., in connection with the import of industrial raw materials for which the production process is lengthy, the import of construction materials, and so forth. The authorities permit the use of suppliers' credit of up to 90 days, except for the financing of a number of specified imports, including motor vehicles for personal use, various household appliances, speci- fied foods, various types of clothing, precious and semipre- cious stones, watches and clocks, toys, and portland cement. The authorities may in special circumstances allow import credit in excess of 90 days for such items as machinery, air- craft, or ships. Transfers of capital abroad by residents re- quire approval, which is granted only in exceptional cases; transfers by individuals are generally limited to IKr 50,000 a year. However, direct investment abroad for the purpose of assisting the marketing of Icelandic products is normally per- mitted. Portfolio investment abroad by residents is prohib- ited. Outward transfers of inheritances, legacies, and emigrants' assets are considered on their merits and are re- stricted. Nonresidents may acquire Icelandic securities and other assets with imported funds; the transfer abroad of the pro- ceeds from the sale of these assets and securities requires authorization. Securities held in Iceland by nonresidents must be registered, and all transactions and operations concerning them are subject to licensing. The import and export of secu- rities by residents are subject to the approval of the Central Bank. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold in Iceland, subject to certain legal requirements. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Central Bank; such licenses are not normally granted except for im- ports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. However, citizens returning to Iceland after a period of residence abroad may freely bring in any gold in their possession. Changes during 1973 January 1. The global quota list for 1973 went into effect. Three items previously subject to global quotas were liberal- ized and several quotas were increased. February 6. A new trade and payments arrangement with Eastern Germany was signed, retroactive to January 1, 1973. Settlements were placed on a convertible basis. February 15. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, a central rate of 0.00747424 gram of fine gold per Icelandic krona was established. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar remained unchanged at IKr 98.5601 = US$1. Iceland continued to avail itself of wider margins. The official buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were changed from IKr 97.60 and IKr 97.90 to IKr 96.50 and IKr 96.80, respectively. April 1. The free trade agreements with the EEC came into force, with the exception of Protocol No. 6. ICELAND April 1. Settlements with Brazil ceased to take place through special U.S. dollar accounts opened under a recipro- cal credit agreement between the two Central Banks. April 16. Law No. 19 introduced new export levies on fish products. April 30. The central rate was changed to 0.00792269 gram of fine gold per Icelandic krona. The effective parity relation- ship for the U.S. dollar became IKr 92.9813 = US$1. Iceland continued to avail itself of wider margins. The official buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were set at IKr 91.00 and IKr 91.30, respectively. June 14. A law was enacted which permitted the establish- ment of official buying and selling rates in such a way that the krona could appreciate (but not depreciate) by more than 2% per cent beyond the central rate. June 15. Iceland ceased to ensure for the time being that the rate for the Icelandic krona would be kept within the margins hitherto observed in exchange transactions between the krona and other currencies. Official buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were initially set at IKr 89.00 and IKr 89.30, respectively. Subsequently, they were changed on June 25, June 29, July 3, July 16, July 18, and September 14. December 28. Law No. 103 of the same date gave the Central Bank the authority, with the approval of the Govern- ment, to determine the margins in daily exchange quotations between the par value or central rate of the krona and the buying and selling rates. 203 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INDIA1 Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.118489 gram of fine gold per Indian Rupee, corresponding to Rs 7.50 = SDR 1. A central rate of Rs 18.9677 = £ stg. 1 has been established. The Reserve Bank of India maintains fixed buying and selling rates for sterling and consequently transactions in all currencies other than sterling and currencies directly linked to sterling take place at fluctuating rates. At the end of December 1973, the Reserve Bank's buying and selling rates for its operations in sterling with authorized dealers were Rs 18.75 and Rs 18.85 per £ stg. 1. The rates of exchange for transactions in sterling have been prescribed by the Reserve Bank. Transactions in foreign currencies other than sterling and currencies directly linked to sterling are conducted through authorized dealers at rates fixed on the basis of market conditions, subject to spot transactions being done at or between the London mar- ket rates for sterling against the other currency concerned. In addition, the Reserve Bank stands ready to purchase U.S. dollars, spot and forward. 2 Authorized dealers are permitted to cover their require- ments of foreign currencies in the London market and to cover their permitted transactions in certain listed currencies (the "permitted currencies") 3 against rupees or any one of these currencies, either spot or forward for periods not ex- ceeding six months, with authorized banks in any country outside the Bilateral Account group. 4 On December 28, 1973, market rates for telegraphic transfers on New York were US$12.42 buying (clean) and US$12.19 selling, per Rs 100, and the Reserve Bank's rates were US$12.3375 buy- ing spot, and US$12.2875, US$12.2200, US$12.1650, and US$12.0175 buying forward (for 1, 2, 3, and 6 months' deliv- ery, respectively) per Rs 100. The Reserve Bank provides forward cover to authorized dealers by purchases of sterling, for up to 9 months' delivery initially (and extendable up to 12 months), and U.S. dollars, for 1, 2, 3, and 6 months' delivery (see footnote 2). Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Reserve Bank of India in accordance with the general policy laid down by the Government of India in consultation with the Reserve Bank. Much of the routine work of exchange control is delegated to certain commercial banks, which act as authorized dealers permitted to buy and sell foreign exchange for specified pur- 1 In view of certain changes that took place early in 1974 (see note at end of this survey) this survey presents the position on January 15, 1974. 2 With effect from March 4, 1974, the Reserve Bank was prepared to purchase deutsche mark spot and forward (for 1, 2, and 3 months' delivery).

There are also special payments arrangements with Afghanistan, Egypt, and Sudan for settlement of their trade with India in specified commodities on a balanced basis within specific ceilings, and special trade and payments arrangements with Bangladesh. The State Trading Corporation of India has an arrangement with the Tunisian agency OCET for balancing purchases of specified commodities. 204 poses under regulations laid down by the Reserve Bank. With respect to direct investments in India, all collaboration pro- posals, with or without equity participation, are reviewed by the Foreign Investment Board. Under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, the general or specific approval of the Re- serve Bank is necessary for the continuance of commercial, industrial, and trading activities in India of companies with more than 40 per cent nonresident interest or for the estab- lishment by them in India of any branch, office, or other place of business for carrying out any such activity. The Reserve Bank's prior permission is also required by nonresidents, noncitizens, nonbanking companies not incorporated under Indian law, and Indian companies with more than 40 per cent nonresident interest for acting or accepting appointment as agents or technical advisers of any person or company in India in the trading or commercial transactions of such per- sons or companies. Import and export licenses are issued by the Controller of Imports and Exports. Prescription of Currency India has ceased to be a Scheduled Territory in terms of the U.K. Exchange Control Act, 1947 but under current U.K. exchange control regulations continues to be regarded as a country of the Overseas Sterling Area. For prescription of currency purposes, countries are divided into two groups: Bilateral Account countries,4 and External Account countries (all other countries). Payments to and from Bilateral Account countries must be settled in Indian rupees through the appropriate clearing ac- count. Payments to 14 External Account countries 5 may be made in rupees to the credit of the account of a resident of any country in this group or in the currency of any country or territory in this subgroup. Payments to all other External Account countries may be made in (1) the currency of the country concerned; (2) the currency of any country of the subgroup mentioned; or (3) rupees to the account of a resi- dent of any country in the External Account group. 6 Re- ceipts from 14 External Account countries (see footnote 5) may be obtained in rupees from the account of a bank in any External Account country, or in the currency of any territory in this subgroup. Receipts from all other External Account countries may be obtained in (1) the currency of the country concerned; (2) the currency of any territory in the subgroup mentioned; or (3) rupees from the account of a bank in any External Account country. Notwithstanding the foregoing, special rules may be applicable in respect of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, the Sudan, and exports under lines of 6 The countries listed are Austria, Belgium-Luxembourg, Canada, Denmark and the Faroe Islands, French Franc Area, Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands Monetary Area, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Liechtenstein, United Kingdom, and United States and territories under U.S. sovereignty. 6 The prior approval of the Reserve Bank is required for all remittances to Pakistan. All remittances by nationals of the People's Republic of China to any country outside India and all remittances to the People's Republic of China by any person resident in India, whether for personal or trade purposes, were stopped with effect from November 3, 1962. All payments due to the Peo- ple's Republic of China are required to be credited to blocked rupee accounts. The prior approval of the Reserve Bank is required for all remittances to Portugal and Rhodesia. ©International Monetary Fund.

Nonresident Accounts The accounts of Indians and of Nepalese and Bhutanese nationals resident in Nepal and Bhutan, as well as the ac- counts of offices and branches of Indian, Nepalese, and Bhu- tanese firms, companies, or other organizations in Nepal and Bhutan are treated as resident accounts.7 Accounts related to all other foreign countries are treated as nonresident ac- counts. The treatment of these accounts distinguishes be- tween those of banks and of others. The accounts of banks are classified in two groups corre- sponding to the division of countries for prescription of cur- rency purposes, i.e., Bilateral Accounts and External Accounts. These accounts may be credited with payments for imports, interest, dividends, and other authorized purposes, with authorized transfers from the nonresident accounts of private firms (including banks) or persons, with proceeds from sales of the currency of the country or monetary area of the account holder, and with proceeds from sales of the cur- rencies of External Account countries. They may be debited for payments for exports and for other payments to residents of India. These accounts may also be debited for transfers to nonresident accounts of persons and firms (including banks), provided that both the transferor and transferee accounts are of External Account countries. Transfers may be made from External Accounts to other External Accounts. All other entries on Bilateral and External Accounts, with the excep- tion of debits by way of payments to residents, require the prior approval of the Reserve Bank. Ordinary nonresident accounts of private individuals or firms may be credited, without prior approval, for payment of dividends and interest on securities, shares, and deposits; refunds of amounts previously debited or overcharged; pro- ceeds of remittances in appropriate foreign currency or trans- fers from appropriate nonresident banks' rupee accounts (see section on Prescription of Currency, above); proceeds from checks issued by the Life Insurance Corporation in respect of maturity or death claims and surrender value of policies held by nonresidents, provided that the Corporation certifies that premiums had been received in India in an approved manner and that actuarial reserves are held in India; and proceeds of checks, provided that the aggregate of such credits during a month does not exceed Rs 2,000 and no individual credit is in excess of Rs 750. Where the nonresident account holder is an Indian national, maturity proceeds of all types of securities as well as sale proceeds of securities sold on stock exchanges in India and the repurchase price of units issued by the Unit Trust of India may be freely credited to his account. Where the account holder (in the case of a joint account, any of the account holders) is a foreign national, authorized dealers may freely credit the sale and maturity proceeds of all types of securities and the repurchase price of units, provided that the securities had been originally purchased either out of funds held in the account or by remittance from abroad, and in the 7 However, residents of Nepal have to obtain their foreign exchange requirements from the Nepal Rastra Bank. INDIA case of sale proceeds, that the sale was made on the stock exchange. Ordinary private nonresident accounts, as well as blocked accounts maintained by persons of Indian nationality or ori- gin who are resident abroad, with a balance of Rs 50,000 or less may be freely debited for local payments. Other ordinary private nonresident accounts may be debited without prior approval for such items as payments for premiums on life insurance policies of the account holder or his dependents; all taxes due from the account holder in India; contributions to the National Defence Fund, the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund, or any government-sponsored charity; allow- ances not exceeding Rs 1,000 a month to relatives and depen- dents in India; investments in Indian Government securities and in units issued by the Unit Trust of India; and for checks up to Rs 1,000 a week drawn in favor of beneficiaries resident in India or in favor of the account holder while temporarily resident in India. For ordinary nonresident accounts of Indian nationals or persons of Indian origin, as well as blocked accounts of such persons with balances in excess of Rs 50,000, the holders may draw up to Rs 2,000 a week during their stay and, in addition, a lump sum of up to Rs 10,000 annually may be debited for any purpose during an account holder's stay in India. Other credits and debits require the prior approval of the Reserve Bank. Transfers are not normally permitted from nonresident accounts of individ- uals or firms to nonresident accounts of banks, unless the amounts originally credited to such accounts could have been transferred abroad. Special regulations cover funds lodged in National Defence Remittance Scheme Special Accounts representing rupee pro- ceeds of inward remittances for the account of nonresidents and rupee proceeds from sales of certificates issued under the Scheme, which expired on May 31, 1966. Balances in such accounts cannot be remitted abroad; they may, however, sub- ject in some cases to prior approval by the Reserve Bank, be invested domestically or be used for other expenditures in India. Withdrawals from such accounts with balances of Rs 50,000 or less held by persons of Indian nationality or origin may be made freely for any payments in India. Nonresident (External) Accounts may freely be opened by authorized dealers in India for persons of Indian nationality or origin resident outside India. They may be freely credited with new funds remitted through banking channels from the country of residence of the account holder. They may also be credited, after approval by the Reserve Bank, with funds from any other nonresident account of the holder, provided such funds are eligible for remittance. The accounts may be freely debited for disbursements in India and for transfer abroad. Interest on moneys standing to the credit of such accounts is exempt from income tax and freely transferable. There are also blocked accounts, to which are credited capital proceeds and payments that are due to nonresidents and may not be remitted abroad. Assets in India of Indian emigrants in excess of the amount allowed to be remitted are also required to be credited to blocked accounts. Balances in blocked accounts may be placed on fixed deposit or invested in Indian rupee securities and shares quoted on stock ex- changes in India (other than bearer securities); the income 205 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INDIA derived from such investments can be remitted to the own- er's country of residence in accordance with the special in- structions issued by the Reserve Bank at the time of opening a blocked account. For Indian nationals who were granted emigration facilities prior to January 1,1963, net income from investments financed from blocked accounts is allowed to be remitted in full. For those granted such facilities between January 1963 and April 1968, remittances of income from assets left behind are limited to Rs 20,000 a year. No income of any kind is remittable to persons who obtained emigration facilities after April 30, 1968. Imports and Import Payments Specified items may be freely imported under an open gen- eral license. Practically all other imports require individual licenses. Imports of specified raw materials, spare parts, and components required by "core" and "priority" industries, in- cluding small-scale industries, and by units in other industries that had an export performance of 10 per cent or more of their production during the previous year, are licensed liberally. Licenses for raw materials and components are issued on a continuing basis generally by way of importers claiming re- plenishment of goods actually consumed during a period of not less than 3 and not more than 12 months. As for spare parts, licenses are issued annually on the basis of prescribed percentages of the c.i.f. value of the imported machinery and of indigenous machinery having imported components. Li- censes to actual users for imports of raw materials, compo- nents, and spare parts are not granted wholly against free foreign exchange, but partly against tied-aid credits from particular countries or against rupees in bilateral clearing accounts. However, a greater preference with respect to the permitted origin of imports is accorded to actual users with specified minimum export performance. Individual licenses may be issued (1) ad hoc, (2) on the basis of quotas allocated to established importers in accordance with their imports in a base period, (3) to actual users on the basis of their require- ments, and (4) to registered exporters in accordance with the import content of their exports. Generally, licenses may be used to import from any coun- try except Namibia (South West Africa), Pakistan, Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa, and Tibet; imports from these countries are prohibited. 8 Such licenses are referred to as General Currency Area Licenses, as distinct from Specific Licenses, which are issued for capital goods and other supplies against tied aid and are valid only for imports from the country or countries providing the assistance. Single Country Licenses are issued for certain imports from countries with which bilateral trade or payments agreements are in force. Licensing policy generally accords priority to foodstuffs, fertilizers, capital goods, raw materials, and other industrial requirements, while the import of other items is severely lim- ited or prohibited. The import program for the period ending March 31, 1974 contains a prohibited list 9 of 1,015 commod- ities and a list of 394 items that are licensed on a "restricted basis," i.e., in minor amounts and only if comparable domes- tic products either are not available or are inadequate. Licens- ing is in most cases on an annual basis. There are special procedures applicable to imports of capital goods, heavy elec- trical plant, and goods imported to fulfill government con- tracts and for irrigation projects. Favored treatment in allocating foreign exchange for imports of capital goods and equipment is given to "core" industries and "priority" indus- tries. An import replenishment scheme enables registered ex- porters to obtain specified raw materials and other items needed for their export production; these commodities in- clude certain items whose import otherwise is banned. In licensing imports of a capital nature, their essentiality, their potential for earning or saving foreign exchange, and the availability of medium-term or long-term credits for financ- ing such imports are taken into account. Import licenses for machine tools and other capital goods valued at more than Rs 750,000 are not granted until Indian producers have been given an opportunity by public advertisement to supply them; licenses are only issued if offers by domestic producers are disproportionately expensive or unacceptable for other rea- sons, or when no offers are received within 45 days. For certain types of steel castings and forgings, this policy applies to all orders of more than Rs 50,000. Where a valid import license is held, the required exchange is released by an authorized bank on presentation of the exchange control copy of the license. License holders may make payments by opening letters of credit or by remitting against sight drafts. Advance remittances before shipping documents can be submitted are not normally allowed; but in special cases, e.g., imports of machinery and capital goods, where deposits have to be made with overseas manufacturers, the Reserve Bank grants special authorization for advance payment for a part of the value of the import. The import of certain commodities, including foodgrains, certain oils and fats, a number of pharmaceutical products, corkwood, raw cotton, raw jute, cashew nuts, most fertilizers, most nonferrous metals, and many categories of steel is re- served for the Government or state trading enterprises, the most important of which are the State Trading Corporation (STC), the Jute Corporation of India, the Food Corporation of India, Hindustan Steel Ltd., and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation. For 1973/74, the number of such com- modities was raised by 20 items to 202 items. In addition, imports of natural rubber, sulphur products, vitamins, and antibiotics are normally arranged under the auspices of the STC. Bulk imports of certain raw materials that are not re- served for the public sector may also be arranged by state agencies, including the Industrial Raw Materials Assistance Centre (IRMAC). In addition to any applicable import duty, imports are subject to an auxiliary duty of 5, 10, or 20 per cent ad valo- rem. Exemptions include foodgrains, raw cotton, tallow, and books. 8 The importation from Nepal of commodities originating in countries other than Nepal or India also is prohibited. 9 Imports of certain prohibited items are permitted either ad hoc or under the import replenishment scheme. 206 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Payments for Invisibles In general, payments abroad for invisibles require ap- proval. Foreign exchange is granted freely for a few such payments, mainly for expenses incidental to trade transac- tions and transfers of recurring contractual obligations. Premiums on insurance policies issued in foreign currency to foreign nationals temporarily resident in India may be paid in rupees or in the currency in which the policy is issued; Indian residents are prohibited from taking out life insurance policies in foreign currencies. Branches of foreign banks are not allowed to transfer abroad any profits arising from the sale of nonbanking assets. Profit remittances by branches of foreign firms established on or after March 1, 1969 require the prior approval of the Reserve Bank. Remittances of dividends by branches and subsidiaries of foreign companies and by companies in which 40 per cent or more of the shares are held by nonresidents, as well as remittances of dividends on individual nonresident holdings of 25 per cent or more of the shares, also require prior Reserve Bank approval. Remittances of dividends by entirely foreign-controlled companies are limited when re- serves are drawn on to finance the dividends. Otherwise there are no restrictions on the remittance of profits, dividends, and interest to beneficiaries permanently resident outside India (except any income accruing to beneficiaries of the National Defence Remittance Scheme), provided that all current tax and other liabilities in India have been cleared, except where such repatriation rights have been voluntarily surrendered. However, remittances to Indian nationals who were granted exchange facilities for emigration on or after January 1, 1963 but before April 30, 1968 of dividends and interest on shares, securities, and deposits held in India are subject to an overall limit of Rs 20,000 a year and to any special directions given to the person concerned when he was granted emigration facilities. For persons who have been granted emigration fa- cilities afrer April 30, 1968 on grounds of hardship, no remit- tance of income is allowed. Foreign nationals temporarily resident in India on account of their business, profession, or employment are permitted to make reasonable remittances to their own countries to pay insurance premiums, for the support of their families, and for other expenses. Authorized dealers may allow such remit- tances by foreign nationals, other than nationals of the Peo- ple's Republic of China, Pakistan, Portugal, and Rhodesia, to the extent of 50 per cent of net income, subject to a maximum of Rs 2,360 a month (Rs 1,500 a month for nationals of Bangladesh). Requests for the remittance of larger amounts are considered on their merits by the Reserve Bank. Applications for foreign exchange for travel or education abroad are considered on an individual basis and require the prior approval of the Reserve Bank. Under the Foreign Travel Scheme, 1970, residents are permitted to travel abroad without "P form" formalities provided they have not visited any place outside India, other than Bangladesh, Mauritius, Nepal, or Sri Lanka, during the period of three years immedi- ately preceding the date of the journey; if traveling by Indian carrier on a round-trip ticket, they are entitled to foreign exchange up to US$ 100 or its equivalent. The scheme is appli- INDIA cable to all destinations except Bangladesh, Mauritius, Ne- pal, and Sri Lanka. Under a Mauritius Travel Scheme, substantially the same facilities are available for travel to Mauritius, except that any visits to Mauritius with either a grant of foreign exchange by the Reserve Bank or passage booked with the prior approval of the Reserve Bank, as well as visits to other countries under the Foreign Travel Scheme, are to be ignored for determining the traveler's eligibility under the three-year rule. There are no restrictions on travel to Bangladesh and Nepal, while passages may be booked freely for air travel from Madras, Tiruchirapalli, or Trivandrum to Colombo, Sri Lanka. The schemes mentioned do not preclude access to other travel facilities (for purposes such as business travel or attendance at conferences or seminars, etc.) that may be approved under normal procedures. Foreign exchange for tourist travel, how- ever, is not normally granted except under the two schemes mentioned above. Travel agents and airlines and steamship companies are not permitted to book passage abroad for persons resident in India (other than foreign nationals tempo- rarily resident in India) unless the traveler is eligible under the Foreign Travel Scheme or the Mauritius Travel Scheme, has been granted travel exchange by the Reserve Bank, or has been specifically granted permission by the Reserve Bank to book his passage. 10 Travel abroad to attend conferences is unrestricted provided expenses are covered by the host insti- tution. The export of Indian currency notes and coins, except to Nepal, is, in general, prohibited. The export to Nepal of Indian currency notes in denominations of Rs 100 or higher is also prohibited. Deck passengers to Burma, Malaysia, Sin- gapore, Persian Gulf ports, and East Africa and passengers to Bangladesh, Pakistan, or Sri Lanka may take with them Rs 20 a person at any one time in Indian notes and coins (within the limit of Rs 30 for Indian and foreign currency notes combined). Residents may take out foreign notes and coins up to £ stg. 3.50 or its equivalent a person; exchange bureaus of authorized dealers and authorized money changers at airports and seaports are permitted to sell foreign currency notes up to a value of £ stg. 3.50 or its equivalent a person to all passengers, whether Indian or foreign, but not to deck passengers or travelers proceeding to Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan, or Sri Lanka, or to foreign nationals who are transit passengers or passengers holding open-dated tickets (including return tickets) issued outside India. Travelers to Pakistan may take Pakistan rupees in notes or coins up to the equivalent of Rs 30 a person; travelers to Sri Lanka and deck passengers to Burma, Malaysia, Singapore, Persian Gulf 10 Prior permission to book passages abroad is not necessary, however, for the following: deck passengers to or from Burma, Malaysia, Pakistan, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Persian Gulf ports, or East Africa; UN staff members and their families whose tickets are purchased by or on instruction from UN agencies; staff of airline and steamer companies traveling on official duty, and families of such staff posted on du ty abroad on a long-term basis; foreign diplomatic personnel stationed in India; families of persons gainfully employed abroad proceeding to join the head of the family or persons gainfully employed abroad returning to their country of employment after a visit to India, provided the fares are paid abroad; employees of Indian insurance companies and banks posted on duty with their branches abroad and their families; persons employed by foreign governments provided the fares are paid abroad; travel between India and Pakistan by persons holding restricted travel documents issued by the High Commission for Pakistan in India or India-Pakistan passports; air travel between Madras /Tiruchirapalli /Trivandrum and Colombo, Sri Lanka; and travel between India and Nepal and between India and Bangladesh. 207 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INDIA ports, or East Africa may take £ stg. 1.50 a person. Nonresi- dents may take out the foreign currency which they declared on entry, less the amounts sold to authorized dealers and authorized money changers in India. A foreign travel tax, at the rate of 15 per cent on first class fares and 10 per cent on economy/tourist class fares, is pay- able where the fare for an international journey is paid in Indian currency; tickets paid for in foreign exchange are ex- empt from the levy. Exports and Export Proceeds Export licenses are required for only a few items, and most commodities may be exported without a license. Most of the controlled commodities are licensed freely to all shippers; a few may be exported through established shippers; and a few commodities are subject to export quotas. Exports to Namibia (South West Africa), Pakistan, Portugal, Rhodesia, South Africa, and Tibet are prohibited. Exchange control is exercised over the proceeds of exports to countries other than Bhutan and Nepal. An exporter must declare that the full export proceeds will be received and dealt with in accordance with the prescription of currency regula- tions. Foreign exchange holdings, including the proceeds of ex- ports, in most currencies ll must be offered for sale against rupees to an authorized dealer, unless the holder has been authorized by the Reserve Bank to retain them, or he is a foreign national not permanently resident in India and the funds do not represent the proceeds of an export. Export proceeds must be surrendered within six months of shipment or, if the goods are sold to Afghanistan or Pakistan, within three months of shipment. The Reserve Bank may allow an extension of the six-month period where exports of capital goods or engineering goods are concerned. Some major exports, including ju te manufactures, are sub- ject to export duties. Exports of mica, tobacco, handwoven woolen carpets, and lac are subject to minimum prices. Some exports receive cash assistance; they are mainly new manufac- tures, such as engineering goods. The cotton textile industry also receives cash assistance. An import replenishment scheme provides preferential import licensing facilities for producers of manufactured goods for export. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles in most currencies 11 must be sur- rendered. All bills rendered by hotels to foreign tourists and to nonresident Indian nationals, other than bills rendered to nationals of Bilateral Account countries, Bhutan, and Nepal, and such other foreign nationals and nonresident Indians as are specifically exempted from compliance with this rule by the Indian Government, must be collected by the hotels in foreign currency. The import of Indian currency notes and coins is, in gen- eral, prohibited. However, deck passengers from Burma, Ma- 11 Canadian dollars, U.S. dollars, most Western European currencies (including sterling), Djibouti francs, East African shillings, Hong Kong dollars, Iraqi dinars, Malaysian dollars, Moroccan dirhams, Panamanian balboas, Philippine pesos, Tunisian dinars, and Vietnamese piastres. 208 laysia, Singapore, Persian Gulf ports, and East Africa, and travelers from Pakistan and Sri Lanka, may import into India Rs 20 a person against presentation of evidence that they previously had exported this amount from India. Persons coming to India from Burma, other than deck passengers, are allowed to bring in Indian currency notes up to a value of Rs 50 for an adult and Rs 25 for a child between the ages of 12 and 18. Travelers from Nepal may bring in up to Rs 75 a person. Foreign currency notes may be brought into India without limit, provided that a declaration of the total amount brought in is made to the customs authorities upon arrival if the value of foreign notes and coins together with the value of the travelers checks brought in exceeds US$1,000 or its equivalent. Persons holding foreign currency notes may sell them to any authorized dealer in foreign exchange or to any authorized money changer. Capital Inward capital transfers are, in general, unrestricted, but their subsequent utilization in India in most cases is subject to approval. Foreign investments, once admitted, are eligible for the same treatment that Indian enterprises receive. Banks in India may borrow freely from their branches and correspondents abroad, provided that borrowings in excess of Rs 2 million are utilized for the purchase of rupees from the Reserve Bank or in the interbank market to finance their normal business operations in India; repayment of such bor- rowings requires the prior approval of the Reserve Bank and may be effected only when the debtor bank has no outstand- ing borrowings in India from the Reserve Bank or any other bank. Foreign borrowing by nonbank Indian companies is sub- ject to Reserve Bank approval; only in exceptional cases is permission granted for any loan which has not been obtained as an official or officially guaranteed credit by the Central Government. Reserve Bank permission is required for initiating, expand- ing, or continuing in India any business activity, or holding or acquiring shares of any company carrying on a trading, commercial, or industrial activity in India, by nonresidents, noncitizens, nonbank companies not incorporated under Indian law, and Indian companies with over 40 per cent nonresident interest. The Reserve Bank will allow the latter companies to continue their activities, provided Indian partic- ipation is not less than 26 per cent of the equity of the com- pany and the company is engaged in production in "core" industries, in predominantly export-oriented production (i.e., at least 60 per cent of output for exports), or in manufacturing activities which require sophisticated technology; tea planta- tions are included among companies benefiting from this pro- vision. Companies engaged predominantly in trading activities or not meeting the other criteria listed will be re- quired to reduce their foreign shareholding to 40 per cent within a specified period or convert their character to meet the above criteria or wind up their activities in India. In exceptional cases, companies not meeting the criteria but which have developed skills, expertise, or facilities, or use technologies, not indigenously available may be permitted ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution greater than 40 per cent foreign participation, provided that the latter does not exceed 76 per cent. Branches of foreign companies other than airlines and shipping companies must in all cases convert themselves into Indian companies. All companies are subject to "dilution" formulas, as fol- lows: companies with foreign direct holdings exceeding 75 per cent must raise 40 per cent of the estimated cost of expansion through additional equity capital issued to Indians; for com- panies with foreign holdings above 60 per cent but below 75 per cent, and above 51 per cent but below 60 per cent, the corresponding proportions are 33V3 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively. No fresh foreign equity is permitted in compa- nies engaged predominantly in internal trading and commer- cial activities. Without the permission of the Reserve Bank, residents are prohibited from lending to, or depositing money with, a nonbank firm or company in which the nonresident interest is more than 40 per cent. Noncitizens, non-Indian firms, and nonbank Indian firms with more than 40 per cent foreign participation must obtain Reserve Bank permission in order to acquire, hold, transfer, or dispose of immovable property within India (except when a lease for a period of not more than five years is involved). Nonresidents besides the above categories of persons and companies must obtain Re- serve Bank permission to allow the use of their trademarks by others for any consideration, and to obtain or continue em- ployment in India as agent or technical or management ad- viser of Indian persons or companies. Residents are prohibited from engaging in any transaction which increases the nonresident share of a business outside India in which the nonresident interest is 49 per cent or less, and they are prohibited, except with Reserve Bank permis- sion, from holding, acquiring, transferring, or disposing of immovable property outside India (except where a lease of not more than five years is involved). Residents also require Reserve Bank approval for transferring any interest in a busi- ness in India to a nonresident, a noncitizen, a nonbank com- pany not incorporated under Indian law, or an Indian company with over 40 per cent foreign participation. Further- more, Reserve Bank approval is required for residents export- ing Indian securities to any place outside India and transferring Indian securities to nonresidents. Residents are prohibited—except with Central Government or Reserve Bank permission —from guaranteeing the obligation of a non- resident or the obligation of a resident in favor of a nonresi- dent, and are also prohibited, except with Central Government permission, from associating with or participat- ing in any business concern outside India. Capital invested in approved projects after January 1, 1950 by residents of other countries, including capital appreciation on the original investment, may be repatriated at any time; the public has been advised, however, to obtain the Reserve Bank's prior approval before effecting a sale when repatria- tion of the assets may exceed Rs 1 million. The proceeds of approved sales are allowed to be remitted in installments, usually of Rs 1 million a year, when the amounts sought to be repatriated are significant. The proceeds from liquidated foreign investments not eligible for repatriation are blocked (see section on Nonresident Accounts, above). INDIA Indian nationals (including persons permanently resident in India) are not normally granted any foreign exchange facil- ities for emigration purposes. In exceptional cases of hard- ship, foreign exchange may be released up to a limit of the equivalent of Rs 25,000 in one lump sum at the time of emigration; the remainder of the emigrant's assets and income are blocked and no further remittances, including pensions, if any, are allowed. Foreign nationals who are temporarily resident in India (other than foreign diplomatic personnel and Bangladesh, Chinese, Pakistani, Portuguese, and Rhodesian nationals) are permitted at the time of their retirement to transfer to their own countries the proceeds from the sale of their investments, subject to a limit of Rs 100,000 for each family at the time of retirement and the remainder in annual installments not exceeding Rs 30,000, provided that the shares and securities concerned are quoted on recognized stock exchanges in India; in addition, they may transfer all their current remit table assets in India. Bangladesh nationals temporarily resident in India are permitted to transfer, be- sides their current assets in full, the sale proceeds of their capital assets up to a limit of Rs 50,000 for each family at the time of their retirement, and the remainder in annual install- ments of Rs 20,000. There are no restrictions on the import into India of Indian or foreign securities. The acquisition, sale, transfer, export, or other disposal of foreign securities requires approval. Persons resident in India are permitted to hold foreign securities that have been acquired in a manner not involving a breach of the Indian exchange regulations; residents, other than foreign nationals not permanently resident in India, who are private persons are not normally permitted to purchase securities or personal real estate outside India. Indian nationals resident abroad and wishing to return to India to take up employment or to set up small industrial units are upon application exempted, for a period of three years, from the requirement that any foreign currency bal- ances in their possession be surrendered within 30 days of arrival. As an alternative to holding such balances in the form of foreign currency, the holder may use the funds for the import, subject to import license, of equipment and capital goods. Furthermore, these persons have the option of surren- dering their balances immediately, with the right to reacquire them within three years in the event of their deciding to go back to a foreign country. These various facilities are not available in respect of earnings arising from employment abroad with any Indian-owned organization. Gold Detailed control is exercised over the manufacture, acquisi- tion, possession, and disposal of gold in various forms through a Gold Control Administrator. There is a total ban on private possession of primary gold. Although there is no ban on possession of finished articles of gold (including coins) previously declared, there is restriction on their manufacture and fresh acquisition. There is no restriction on the manufac- ture, acquisition, disposal, or possession of gold ornaments, except that holdings of such ornaments (which may be of any purity) above specified limits are subject to the requirement 209 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INDIA of declaration. The consumption of gold by industrial users is regulated through permits and authorizations. Control is exercised over dealers and goldsmiths through a system of licensing. Gold refining is under state management. The Gov- ernment Mint is licensed under the Gold Control Law to accept tenders of gold for purposes of refining and conversion into standard gold bars, for which strict specifications as to fineness, weight, dimensions, and markings are prescribed. Forward trading in gold or silver is prohibited, as is the export of silver. 12 With the exception of jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler, imports of gold in any form by residents other than the monetary authorities require special authoriza- tion from the Reserve Bank and are not normally permitted; established jewelers, however, are from time to time granted licenses to import gold for the manufacture in their work- shops of jewelry for export. Exports of gold in any form other than jewelry produced in India for export and jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler are prohibited unless the export is made by or on behalf of the monetary authorities. The export of gold ornaments and jewelry to the Bilateral Account countries and Pakistan is prohibited. Changes during 1973 January 1. A special clearing arrangement for travel expen- ditures was added to the existing payments agreement with Bangladesh. The arrangement provided for settlements in nonconvertible Indian rupees. January 1. Following the expiration on December 31, 1972 of the bilateral payments agreement with Yugoslavia, settle- ments with that country took place in convertible currencies, with certain exceptions for existing import and export con- tracts. January 1. The amount of Indian currency notes and coins that residents traveling to Bangladesh for business and pri- vate visits could take with them freely was reduced from Rs 500 to Rs 20 a person a trip. January 10. A.D. Circular No. 2 withdrew, with effect from February 1, the general permission granted to autho- rized dealers to open freely, without any exchange control formalities, rupee accounts in the names of residents of for- mer East Pakistan temporarily resident in India; the accounts of such persons who had returned to Bangladesh would be treated as nonresident accounts with effect from February 1. January 13. The Reserve Bank would henceforth entertain requests from authorized dealers for extensions of forward sterling purchase contracts only near the due date of the contract, and in any case not earlier than two weeks before the due date. January 31. The trade agreement of 1939 with the United Kingdom expired. February 12. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the Reserve Bank suspended its spot and forward purchases of U.S. dollars. On February 13, 12 With effect from February 19, 1974, the prohibition on exports of silver was lifted. On February 21, it was announced that exports of silver would be subject to license but not to quantitative restrictions. 210 the Bank suspended its forward purchases of sterling, while continuing to purchase and sell sterling for ready delivery in dealings with authorized dealers at the rates prevailing on February 12. However, these rates were treated as provi- sional. Authorized dealers were instructed to restrict their transactions in foreign currencies and to put through transac- tions for amounts above Rs 2,000 on a provisional basis, except in the case of the bona fide and unavoidable require- ments of travelers (up to the equivalent of Rs 2,000 a trav- eler). The February 12 rates for the Reserve Bank's spot purchases and sales of sterling were subsequently treated as final, with retrospective effect from February 13. The Indian rupee continued to float with sterling. February 16. The Reserve Bank resumed its purchases of spot U.S. dollars, but only as cover in respect of authorized dealers' purchases in the form of banknotes and travelers checks; it was prepared to purchase any surplus U.S. dollars from authorized dealers at a special rate of Rs 7.60 per U.S. dollar, against purchases of U.S. dollar banknotes and trav- elers checks made by the authorized dealer concerned at rates not lower than those prescribed on the same date by the Reserve Bank. (The prescribed rates were modified on May 16 and on several occasions subsequently.) February 16. The limit of Rs 2,000 on foreign currency transactions of authorized dealers with the public (including travelers) was withdrawn. Authorized dealers were also per- mitted to conduct all transactions on the basis of firm rates. March 8. The Reserve Bank resumed its forward purchases of sterling, for periods up to six months only, at the same rates as before February 13. Forward contracts initially made for three months could be extended for a further period of three months. March 20. A 10 per cent export duty was imposed on tanned cattle hides. March 26. Exports of cotton yarn were suspended until July 1, except under existing approved contracts. No new contracts for shipment before September 1 could be entered into. March 28.

The import policy for 1973/74 came into effect. Changes in import policy included (1) for exporters of manu- factures who had doubled their exports between 1971/72 and 1972/73, the value limit for the import of restricted items was raised from 5 per cent to 10 per cent of export value; (2) 11 industries were added to the list of priority industries; (3) nonpriority industries became subject to the scheme of com- pulsory export obligation, by which large-scale units failing to export 5 per cent of their production are liable to a reduc- tion in their import licenses and are no longer granted prefer- ences with regard to sources of supply; (4) units exporting at least 10 per cent of their production were made eligible for preferred sources of supply and other import privileges, while units exporting at least 25 per cent were to receive substan- tially greater preference in these regards; (5) small-scale units in nonpriority industries were to be granted import licenses for a value 20 per cent higher than the year before, while ©International Monetary Fund.

April 1. Several important changes in import duties came into effect. They included the following: (1) auxiliary import duties were introduced of 20, 10, and 5 per cent, applying, respectively, to imports with effective ad valorem duties of 100 per cent or more, 60 per cent to 100 per cent, and less than 60 per cent, with the main exemptions being for food- grains, raw cotton, tallow, and books; these duties replaced the previous "regulatory duties" which had ranged from 2.5 per cent to 10 per cent; (2) rates of duty bound under the GATT were revised upward on 42 items; and (3) duties were increased also on a number of other items, including raw cotton, stainless steel plates, sheets, and strips, copper, and machinery. April 1. Exports of goods of Bhutanese origin to countries other than Nepal were required to be declared on prescribed exchange control forms of a distinctive color, to facilitate the transfer of the foreign exchange proceeds to Bhutan. April 1. The export of manganese ore containing more than 46 per cent manganese was suspended. April 1. The suspension of exports of mustard seed, rape- seed, and mustard oil was continued for the 1973/74 licensing period. April 16. Exports of fertilizers, including superphosphates, were banned. April 21. Remittances that may be effected by authorized dealers on behalf of Indian newspapers and magazines in payment of copyright materials, special articles, news photos, or pictures contributed by persons permanently resident out- side India were limited to £ stg. 15 an article or item and to cases where the beneficiary was an individual. April 28. The export du ty on "black" iron ore was raised from Rs 4 to Rs 7 a ton. May 8. Authorized dealers required the Reserve Bank's approval before transferring from one branch to another the accounts of branches in India of foreign firms, companies, or other organizations, or of firms in India controlled by persons resident outside India.

The ban on exports of cotton yarn was continued, except for certain specified varieties, until July 31 or until such further time as might be decided. July 5. A "two-tier agreement" including a "balanced trade and payments agreement" was signed with Bangladesh. It came into effect on September 28, 1973, when the trade and payments agreement of March 28, 1972 expired, which had provided for "three-tier arrangements." Trade between the two countries in listed commodities up to earmarked values was placed on a balanced basis for a period of three years; such trade was to be settled through special accounts at two designated banks. Other trade with Bangladesh would be settled in sterling or other convertible currencies. The provi- sion for border trade in small quantities of specified commod- ities, which existed in the earlier trade agreement, was discontinued. July 27. Exports of rayon filament yam were banned. July 30. Restrictions were placed on the export of indige- nous raw wool during the 1973/74 licensing period. August 20. The Reserve Bank was prepared to purchase sterling forward for delivery up to 9 months. One or more extensions of a forward contract (which could be initially for 3, 6, or 9 months' delivery) would be permitted, for both existing and fu ture contracts, subject to the condition that the total period of delivery should not exceed 12 months, from the date of the original contract. August 27. Authorized dealers were required to submit authenticated copies of the relevant firm export orders (against which foreign exchange had been purchased by the authorized dealers from their customers) with all offers of forward sterling to the Reserve Bank of £ stg. 150,000 or more. August 28. The export du ty on hessian was reduced from Rs 600 to Rs 200 a ton. The export duty on sacking was abolished. September 3. The Reserve Bank resumed its purchases of U.S. dollars, both spot and forward, the latter for three months' delivery only. Spot dollars would be purchased at the cross rate between the London market's spot buying rate for the U.S. dollar at the close of the preceding working day and the Reserve Bank's spot buying rate for the pound sterling on the date of purchase. The Reserve Bank's forward buying rate for the U.S. dollar would be determined in a similar manner. Deliveries under forward sale contracts for three months en- tered into by the authorized dealers were to be made only on the due date indicated on the contracts. September 19. The Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 was enacted, replacing with effect from January 1, 1974 the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947. It was published in the Official Gazette on September 20. The new or modified provisions of this Act were as follows: (1) Legal sanctions were provided against false invoicing of imports or exports and against remittances of funds into India through unofficial channels. The Central Government was given the right to specify goods which, if exported on a consignment basis, 211 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INDIA could not (without Reserve Bank permission) be sold at a price less than the price declared at time of shipment. (2) The Reserve Bank was given the right to block securities of per- sons who had emigrated abroad as well as the bank accounts and securities of prospective emigrants. (3) The Central Gov- ernment was given the right to require payment in foreign exchange for specific goods and services from persons resi- dent outside India who are on a visit to India, and to exempt any person or class of persons from this requirement. (4) Residents were prohibited, without Reserve Bank permission, from holding, or engaging in any transactions with respect to, immovable property outside India; exempt from this provi- sion was the acquisition or transfer of such property by lease for a period not over five years. (5) Residents were prohibited from engaging without Reserve Bank permission in any transaction which increased to more than 49 per cent the nonresident share of a business outside India in which the nonresident interest was 49 per cent or less. (6) Residents were prohibited from transferring, without Reserve Bank permission, any interest in a business in India to a nonresident, a noncitizen, a nonbank company not incor- porated under Indian law, or any company in India with a nonresident interest of more than 40 per cent. (7) Residents were prohibited, except with Reserve Bank permission, from giving a guarantee in respect of any obligation of a nonresi- dent or in respect of any obligation of a resident due or owing to a person resident outside India. (8) Residents were prohib- ited, except with Reserve Bank permission, from lending to, or depositing money with, a nonbank firm or company in which the nonresident interest is more than 40 per cent. (9) Residents were prohibited, without Central Government per- mission, from associating with, or participating in, any busi- ness concern outside India. (10) Nonresidents, noncitizens, nonbank companies not incorporated under Indian law, and companies with over 40 per cent nonresident interest, could not take up new employment or continue to be employed in India as agent or technical or management adviser of Indian persons or companies without Reserve Bank permission. (11) Compensation for the use in India of trademarks be- longing to the four categories of persons or companies listed in (10) above was made subject to Reserve Bank permission. (12) Reserve Bank permission was made mandatory for car- rying on in India any activity of a trading, commercial, or industrial nature, or establishing a place of business in India for such purposes, or acquiring the whole or any part of any undertaking in India (including the purchase of shares) by the four categories of persons or companies listed in (10) above. Reserve Bank permission would be required even for continu- ing already established businesses of the type described or continuing to hold shares already acquired. However, the Reserve Bank was empowered to exempt both specific indi- viduals (or companies) and classes of individuals (or compa- nies) from the requirement of obtaining its permission for continuing already established businesses or continuing to carry on activities of the types described. (13) Reserve Bank permission was made mandatory for non-Indian nationals taking up any employment, practising any profession, or car- rying on any occupation in India, in cases where the individ- ual involved wished to acquire foreign exchange in order to 212 remit abroad earnings from such activities. (14) The four categories of persons and companies listed in (10) above were prohibited, unless with Reserve Bank permission, from ac- quiring, holding, transferring, or disposing of any immovable property in India, except in the case of acquisition or transfer of such property by a lease for a period not exceeding five years. September 24. Dealings in U.K. and U.S. banknotes be- tween authorized dealers and authorized money changers were allowed to take place at rates determined by market conditions, as in the case of other foreign currency notes. This was done to enable money changers to offer their customers, in the same way as authorized dealers could, better dollar and sterling rates than the maximum and minimum rates laid down from time to time by the Reserve Bank. September 26. The Reserve Bank henceforth would pur- chase U.S. dollars forward also for one, two, and six months* delivery. Delivery three days before the due date would be accepted for one, two, or three-month forward contracts, and seven days before the due date for six-month forward contracts, without any adjustment in the contract rates. The rate for the Reserve Bank's forward purchases of U.S. dollars for delivery on completion of one month or two mon ths would be the cross rate between the London mar- ket's buy ing rate for forward dollars for the appropriate deliv- ery at the close of the preceding working day and the Reserve Bank's buying rate for forward sterling for three months' delivery ruling on the day of purchase. The rate for the pur- chase of six months' forward dollars would be based on the London market forward buying rate for six months' dollars and the Reserve Bank's buying rate for six months' forward sterling. October 1. Residents of India holding sums in pound ster- ling accounts prior to July 8, 1947 ("pre-zero accounts"), who had been permitted to maintain these accounts in sterling and to make foreign or domestic transfers out of them without special permission from the Reserve Bank, were required to repatriate before November 1, 1973 any balances held in such accounts unless they obtained special permission from the Reserve Bank to maintain such accounts and operate thereon. October 3. Imports of hides, skins, and tanning substances were permitted under Open General License until March 31, 1974. October 20. Exports of raw silk were suspended until De- cember 31, 1973. October 23. The Central Government appointed January 1, 1974 as the date on which all sections of the Foreign Ex- change Regulations Act, 1973 would come into force. December 13. An agreement with the United States was initialed under which that country would relinquish its claim to the major part of its rupee holdings; the agreement was signed on February 18, 1974. December 17. A commercial cooperation agreement was signed with the EEC. It came into force on April 1, 1974. December 20. The Ministry of Finance published guidelines for administering the foreign investment provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973. Like the Act itself, these guidelines were to be put into effect on January 1, 1974. Major features of these guidelines were as follows: (1) All ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution branches of foreign companies, except airlines and shipping companies, would be required to convert themselves into Indian companies. (2) Indian companies with more than 40 per cent foreign shareholding engaged in production of prior- ity industries, or exporting at least 60 per cent of their total production, or engaged in manufacturing requiring sophisti- cated technology, or consisting of tea plantations, would be permitted to continue their activities if they increased Indian participation to not less than 26 per cent within a specified period. (3) Indian manufacturing and trading companies with more than 40 per cent foreign shareholding, and not engaged in the activities specified in (2), would be required either to bring their foreign shareholding down to 40 per cent within a specified period or to change their character to predomi- nantly manufacturing activities of the type listed in (2); cer- tain exceptions might be made where such companies had developed expertise or facilities not indigenously available and were contributing significantly to exports. (4) Indian manufacturing companies with more than 40 per cent foreign shareholding engaged in trading activities in respect of prod- ucts not manufactured by them would be permitted to trade products in the overall interest of the consumers provided the value of such products did not exceed 25 per cent of the value of total production or Rs 50 million, whichever was less. NOTE.—The following changes came into effect early in 1974: January 1. The Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 came into force (see September 19 entry, above). The Ministry of Finance guidelines on the foreign investment provisions of the Act also came into force (see December 20, above). The Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947 was revoked. January 1. The Reserve Bank issued two Press Notes and a Circular to authorized dealers regarding Sections 28 and 29 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973. In terms of these sections, persons resident outside India (including Indian citizens), foreign citizens resident in India, and compa- nies (other than banking companies) incorporated abroad or in which the nonresident interest was more than 40 per cent, as well as branches of such companies, were required to ob- tain the permission of the Reserve Bank for the following: Under Section 28: (1) To act, or accept appointment, as agent in India of any person or company, in the trading or commercial transactions of such person or company. (2) To act, or accept appointment, as technical or management ad- viser in India of any person or company. (3) To permit any trademark, which the said persons or companies are entitled to use, to be used by any other person or company for any direct or indirect consideration. Under Section 29: (1) To carry on in India any activity of a trading, commercial, or industrial nature. (2) To establish in India a branch, office, or other place of business for carry- ing on such activities. (3) To acquire, either wholly or partly, any undertaking in India of a person or company carrying on any trade, commerce, or industry. (4) To purchase shares in India of Indian companies. (5) To continue to hold shares of INDIA Indian companies which were acquired before the commence- ment of the new Act, i.e., prior to January 1, 1974. The permission of the Reserve Bank also was required for the continuance of the arrangements relating to items (1), (2), and (3) under Section 28 above, which were entered into by the said persons or companies prior to January 1, 1974, as also for the continuance of their existing trading, commercial, or industrial activities. January 1. The Reserve Bank issued a Notification stating that under subsection (1) of Section 31 of the Foreign Ex- change Regulation Act, 1973, it permitted any company re- ferred to in that subsection: (1) To acquire or hold any immovable property situated in India, provided that (a) such acquisition or holding of immovable property was necessary for or incidental to carrying on by such company of any activity permitted under Section 28 or Section 29 of the Act; and (b) such company filed a declaration, not later than 90 days from the date of such acquisition or holding, giving full particulars of the transaction as might be required by the Reserve Bank in that regard. (2) To transfer, by way of secu- rity for any borrowing permitted under subsection (7) of Section 26 of the said Act, any such immovable property so acquired or held. January 1. The Reserve Bank issued a Notification cancel- ing its Notification of September 12,1958, which had permit- ted the transfer of any security or the creation or transfer of any interest in any security by any person resident in India to a foreign national also resident in India. January 1. The Reserve Bank issued a Notification permit- ting any person who is resident in India but is out of India to open with a bank situated out of India an account in foreign exchange and operate thereon during his stay out of India, provided that certain conditions were met. The permis- sion would cease to be effective upon the account holder's return to India. January 1. The Reserve Bank issued a number of other notifications, most of which served to continue previous ex- change control regulations or exemptions. January 3. The Reserve Bank issued a Press Note about immovable property in India. Persons who were not citizens of India and companies (other than banking companies) which were not incorporated under any law in force in India, or in which the nonresident interest was more than 40 per cent, had to obtain the permission of the Reserve Bank to acquire, hold, transfer, or dispose of in any manner (except by way of lease for a period not exceeding five years) any immovable property situated in India. This was in accordance with Section 31 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973. Applications for acquiring, holding, transferring, or dis- posing of any immovable property in India by foreign citizens and also by foreign companies (the latter as permitted under the notification issued by the Reserve Bank on January 1, 1974, referred to above) had to be made in a prescribed form to the Controller of the Exchange Control Department of the Reserve Bank, while applications for the sale of tea, coffee, and rubber estates in India, which were owned by sterling companies, and remittance of the sale proceeds thereof out- side India had to be made to the regional offices of the Re- 213 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INDIA serve Bank within whose jurisdiction the estates were situ- ated. Persons and companies holding any immovable prop- erty in India on January 1,1974 were required to declare such holdings to the Reserve Bank in a prescribed form before April 1, 1974. Such declarations as well as those under the Reserve Bank notification of January 1, in respect of foreign companies referred to above, were also required to be submit- ted to the Central Office of the Reserve Bank. January 4. The Reserve Bank issued a Press Note regarding immovable property outside India. Without the permission of the Reserve Bank, no Indian citizen resident in India or firm or company registered or incorporated in India could acquire, hold, transfer, or dispose of any immovable property situated outside India. Such permission was not, however, required, in respect of immovable property acquired or transferred by way of lease for a period not exceeding five years. Applica- tions for permission had to be made to the Controller of the Exchange Control Department of the Reserve Bank's Central Office. Persons, firms, or companies already holding immovable property abroad had to declare the holdings to the above office of the Reserve Bank in a prescribed form before April 1, 1974. January 11. The Reserve Bank issued a Notification by which, under subsection (7) of Section 26 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973, it permitted, with respect to a firm or company (other than a banking company), referred to in the said subsection: (1) the making of any security deposit by any employee of such firm or company and the acceptance of such deposit by such firm or company; (2) the making of any payments (whether by way of advance or otherwise) to such firm, or company, by purchasing, selling, or other agents in the course of, or for the purpose of, the business of such firm or company, or against orders for goods, properties, or services, and the acceptance of such payments by such firm or company; and (3) the lending of any money to, or the making of any deposit with, such firm or company, as had been permitted under (1) and (2) to borrow money or, as the case might be, to accept deposits. January 14. The Reserve Bank issued a Press Note explain- ing the provisions of each notification issued on January 11 about lending money to, or making deposits with, foreign firms and companies, and advising persons who intended to lend money to, or make deposit with, a firm or company of the kind referred to, to satisfy themselves that the firm or company concerned had been permitted to borrow money or accept deposits. Firms or companies of the kind referred to intending to borrow money from any bank authorized to deal in foreign exchange in India were required to submit an application in the prescribed form to the bank concerned. Where, however, they proposed to borrow from other sources or to accept deposits from residents in India, the registered, head, or prin- cipal office of the firm or company had to make an applica- tion in the prescribed form direct to the office of the Reserve Bank within whose jurisdiction the applicant's office was situated. 214 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Exchange Rate System Nonresident Accounts INDONESIA No par value for the Indonesian Rupiah has been estab- lished with the Fund. In the Jakarta foreign exchange Bourse, transactions in U.S. dollars are effected at rates within 1 per cent either side of Rp 415 per US$1; on December 31, 1973 the buying and selling rates were Rp 414.50 and Rp 416.00, respectively, per US$1. Exchange rates for other currencies are determined on the basis of the Jakarta rates for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, and rates for the currencies concerned in international markets. An additional effective exchange rate results from the application of a 10 per cent exchange tax to the proceeds from the export of most com- modities; a 5 per cent exchange tax on the proceeds of exports of coconut oil is ineffective, since at present such exports are prohibited. In the Jakarta foreign exchange Bourse three calls for ex- change are conducted each week under the management of Bank Indonesia. Bidding for exchange in the call is restricted to the foreign exchange banks and licensed foreign exchange dealers. Bank Indonesia is committed to deal with any will- ing buyer or seller at the going rate. Representatives of the foreign exchange banks notify Bank Indonesia of their sup- ply to the market and each presents a bid for the total of his bank's requirements at a particular rate. Bank Indonesia clears the market at the intervention rate. The Bank also offers authorized banks certain facilities for forward contracts in respect of aid exchange and for swap transactions. Sabang is entirely outside the Indonesian exchange and trade control system, but the Indonesian rupiah is legal tender there. It is also legal tender in Irian Jaya (West Irian), where the Irian Barat rupiah has ceased to be legal tender. All laws and regulations concerning foreign exchange and the foreign trade control system are applicable also in Irian Jaya. Administration of Control The implementation of exchange and trade control is en- trusted to Bank Indonesia, the Ministry of Trade, the Minis- try of Finance, authorized foreign exchange banks, and the customs authorities. Exchange control is administered by Bank Indonesia and the Ministry of Finance. Prescription of Currency Payments and receipts must be effected through the autho- rized banks and are normally effected in convertible curren- cies. Export proceeds must be received in Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Hong Kong dollars, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Malaysian dollars, Netherlands guilders, New Zealand dollars, Norwegian kroner, Portu- guese escudos, pounds sterling, Singapore dollars, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, or U.S. dollars. Indonesia has no opera- tive payments agreements. * 1 Indonesia maintains an inoperative bilateral payments agreement with the People's Republic of China. No distinction is made between resident and nonresident accounts, as the 1964 Foreign Exchange Act recognizes only foreign nationals and Indonesian nationals. There are no re- strictions on the opening by foreign nationals of accounts in Indonesia in rupiahs or foreign currencies. Imports and Import Payments There is a registry of authorized importers and an initial deposit is required for registration. Since October 31, 1968, only Indonesian nationals may obtain an importer's license, but certain established foreign firms have been enabled to retain their licenses and new foreign investors can obtain an importer's license restricted to the import of materials re- quired for their own projects. Imports from Angola, Rhodesia, and South Africa are pro- hibited, as are imports from all sources of specified commodi- ties, including built-up commercial vehicles and motorcycles; radio and television sets in built-up or seraiknocked-down condition; sarongs; galvanized iron sheets; iron roofing sheets; mosquito sticks; secondhand goods; matches; mono- sodium glutamate; mattresses; and specified types of textiles, car tires, batteries, printed matter, office supplies, animal traps, bottles, and lamps and bulbs. 2 The importing of cloves, fertilizers, rice, refined sugar, and wheat and wheat flour is restricted to specified approved importers. No licenses are required for imports. All permitted imports may be paid for either with general exchange (Devisa Umum) or aid ex- change (Devisa Kredii). For imports financed with aid ex- change a compensation payment is granted after customs clearance; this payment ranges from Rp 20 to Rp 45 per U.S. dollar of the import value, depending on country of origin and/or donor country. Importers may without bank guarantee contract short-term credit under "merchant letters of credit," 3 but otherwise sight letters of credit are required for all private sector imports with the exception of parcel imports, goods brought in by travelers of a value not exceeding US$100, and imports specifically authorized by the Ministry of Trade (such as goods constituting part of a foreign investment). A rupiah deposit of 100 per cent of the amount of the letter of credit must be lodged with Bank Indonesia when a letter of credit is opened in respect of government imports; for non- government imports financed with general exchange, import- ers are required to make an advance deposit of at least 40 per cent of the letter of credit value when they submit applica- tions for letters of credit to authorized banks, and to settle the balance within 75 days of the opening of the letter of credit. Importers' requests for registration of merchant letters of credit with foreign exchange banks must be accompanied by a deposit of 25 per cent of the value. The deposits are released * On January 22, 1974 imports of built-up sedans and station wagon sedans also were prohibited, as were imports of components for the assembly of luxury-type automobiles. 3 A merchant letter of credit is a payments form providing for short-term suppliers' credit. It is not a bankers' letter of credit and carries no commitments on the part of the bank through which it is opened. 215 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution INDONESIA to the importer only for payment or when he presents corre- spondence from suppliers indicating that the merchant letter of credit has been canceled; if the import is declared free of payment, however, the deposit is released after the issuance of the KPP document. The amount of the deposit against letters of credit for nongovernment imports financed with aid exchange is left to the discretion of the authorized bank if the latter purchases aid exchange forward from Bank Indonesia. Import duties, which are almost without exception ad valo- rem, are imposed on the c.i.f. value of the commodities con- verted at the customs valuation rate (Rp 415 per US$1 on December 31, 1973). Sales taxes of 5, 10, and 20 per cent are levied on most imports on their c. & f. value plus import duty. Items which are exempted from import duties are also ex- empted from sales taxes. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles These are not restricted or subject to control. Proceeds from invisibles need not be surrendered. Travelers may take out and bring in any amount in foreign banknotes but only Rp 2,500 in Indonesian notes and coins other than gold and silver commemorative coins; Indonesian commemorative gold and silver coins may be taken out freely up to Rp 65,000 a person. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Angola, the People's Republic of China, Israel, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited, as are exports to all countries of gold ore and pure gold; copra; coconut oil; certain types of corn; clove seeds; pepper seeds; fertilizers; rawhides of cattle; certain categories of unpro- cessed or low-quality rubber; certain logs and timber; and scrap bronze, copper, and iron (other than scrap bronze and copper from Irian Jaya). The prior authorization of the Minis- ter of Trade is required for the export of flatbark crepe, cinchona bark, scrap iron (from Java and Madura), silver, and antiques of cultural value. Otherwise, all commodities may be freely exported by registered private firms and state trading firms. All exporters except the petroleum companies, certain min- ing companies, and licensed "border-crossing" traders must require their buyers to open a bank letter of credit covering the value of the goods to be exported. For certain minor exports, including handicrafts, the exporter must surrender the full foreign exchange value prior to shipment if there is no buyer's letter of credit. 4 For the principal export commodi- ties other than petroleum, the sales price must not be lower than "indication" prices ("check" prices) determined periodi- cally by the Minister of Trade. The full proceeds from exports other than petroleum, products of certain mining companies, and goods exported by licensed "border-crossing" traders are subject to surrender (except in "border-crossing" trade, see below) and, except for finished goods, batik textiles and other handicrafts, plywood, fresh fish, and a number of other items, are subject to a 10 per cent exchange tax. Exports of petro- leum and of products of certain mining companies are also 4 There are separate arrangements for exports of orchids. 216 exempt from exchange tax. The exporter settles the tax on receipt of the export proceeds. A specific cess is levied on exports of certain agricultural products and on interisland trading in the same products. Certain commodities produced in border regions may be exported to Malaysia and Singapore in exchange for certain eligible goods. In this "border-crossing" trade, the value of import or export shipments must not exceed MS600 a month, if transported overland, and M$600 a shipment, if trans- ported by sea. Capital The Foreign Capital Investment Law of January 10, 1967, as amended in August 1970, provides various incentives for the investment of foreign capital in Indonesia. Investments in specified fields of activity (including harbors, electric power, shipping, railroads, and commerce) may be undertaken only through a joint venture with an Indonesian partner. 5 The Investment Law specifies a system of investment priorities; it assigns the highest priority to certain specified fields, fol- lowed by investments which are located outside Java, invest- ments which generate or save foreign exchange, and investments in infrastructure. All investments in Indonesia require the approval of the Capital Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM). Enter- prises that are wholly or largely operated in Indonesia as separate business units must be incorporated under Indone- sian law and must have their domicile in Indonesia. The operating permit for foreign investment is usually valid for a maximum of 30 years. Among the inducements offered are exemption from, or reduction in, corporate and dividend taxes for a certain number of years. Joint ventures by Indone- sians and foreigners may benefit from similar tax incentives. Other inducements include exemption from customs duties, accelerated depreciation allowances, and permission to offset initial losses against subsequent profits; foreign investments with a minimum capital of US$15 million may receive addi- tional benefits. Investors are granted the right to transfer profits (after settlement of taxes and financial obligations in Indonesia) and to make transfers relating to expenses con- nected with the employment of foreign nationals in Indone- sia, and in respect of depreciation allowances after the expiration of the tax holiday from corporation tax. The law provides that no transfer permit shall be issued for capital repatriation as long as the investments benefit from tax relief; at present, however, foreign payments do not require a trans- fer permit. The law implicitly provides guarantees against nationalization of foreign investments. Equitable and mutu- ally satisfactory arrangements are stipulated for resolving the issue of just compensation in the event of nationalization of any specific foreign investment. A special regime applies to enterprises previously national- ized but now restored to the original owners.

The transfer of proceeds from the sale of the assets of those restored enterprises which ceased operations could take place with effect from January 1, 1972 at the rate of one f i f th of the proceeds each year, with a full guarantee as to their value in foreign currency. The transfer of proceeds from the sale of assets of enterprises whose period of operation has expired or whose operations have been termi- nated by the Government is allowed at the rate of one f i f th a year effective from the time of the sale of assets. This trans- fer is guaranteed as to its value in foreign currency. A Debt Investment Conversion Scheme (DIGS) exists for the benefit of foreign creditors holding nonguaranteed claims against Indonesia. Rupiahs covered by the Scheme are ad- ministered in two kinds of DIGS-Rupiah Accounts, A and B, the former relating only to claims of which the creditor is the first holder. Private creditors willing to accept the terms of the Scheme and prepared to make investments under the Foreign Investment Law of 1967 are paid in rupiahs in settle- ment of their claims. These claims are transferable to other potential investors in Indonesia, but only the original credi- tor's DIGS rupiahs may be used, in the creditor's own projects that have been approved under the Foreign Invest- ment Law of 1967, for the purchase of foreign exchange for the import of equipment and raw materials necessary for the establishment and operation of those projects. There are no limitations on the remittance to Indonesia of capital in the form of foreign exchange or in commodities. Both residents and nonresidents may hold foreign currency deposits with foreign exchange banks. Foreign exchange banks, however, are subject to Bank Indonesia directives with respect to borrowing abroad, the acceptance of deposits from nonresidents, and the issuance of certificates of deposit to nonresidents. Furthermore, a uniform reserve requirement of 30 per cent is applicable to the foreign currency liabilities of the foreign exchange banks. Certain other borrowing abroad is subject to direct control. The prior approval of the Minister of Finance is required before any public enterprise or public sector body may accept a loan from abroad. Indonesian citizens and residents of foreign nationality may freely transfer, negotiate, import, and export securities denominated in rupiahs or in foreign currency. Gold Indonesia has issued five commemorative gold coins, which are legal tender. Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold and gold coins in Indonesia. Exports of gold ore and pure gold, unless made by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, are prohibited by virtue of Decision No. 6 8 /K P / IV / 70 of April 17, 1970 of the Minister of Trade. Travelers may freely take out Indonesian commemorative gold and silver coins up to Rp 65,000 a person; amounts in excess require the prior approval of Bank Indonesia. Imports of gold are free of license but require prior notification to the Ministry of Industry and are subject to an extra levy of Rp 25 per US$1. INDONESIA Changes during 1973 During the year a number of minor exports were exempted from the 10 per cent exchange tax. The export cesses levied on a number of other commodities, including some major exports, were increased. January 31. A new import tariff came into force, based on the Brussels Tariff Nomenclature. February 12. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the exchange rate of Rp 415 = US$1 was maintained unchanged. March 20. The export cesses on certain types of copra were increased. March 31. The Irian Barat rupiah ceased to be legal tender in Irian Jaya. April 1. Exports of rawhides of cattle were prohibited. April 12. A uniform reserve requirement of 30 per cent became applicable to the liabilities denominated in foreign exchange of foreign exchange banks, including all advance import deposits. The existing differential requirements were abolished. May 1. The advance import deposit requirement for non- government imports financed with general foreign exchange was reduced from 100 per cent to 40 per cent. May 18. Bank Indonesia prohibited the opening of usance letters of credit by foreign exchange banks. May 22. Detailed regulations were issued for the implemen- tation of Presidential Decree No. 59/1972 of October 12, 1972. They related to procedures for the approval and report- ing of foreign credits with a maturity in excess of one year (except when obtained from international institutions) and shorter-term "roll-over" credits. June 1. A Capital Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) was established to replace the Technical Committee on Capital Investment and its subcommittees (the Foreign Investment Board and the Domestic Investment Board). The BKPM would be responsible for approving all domestic and foreign investment in Indonesia. June 6. Exports of fertilizers were prohibited. July 1. Exports of rawhides of sheep and goats were prohib- ited. July 4. Exports of certain types of com and cassava were prohibited. August 1. The BKPM reaffirmed that reporting to Bank Indonesia was required by foreign investors covered by the Foreign Capital Investment Law. The requirement related to the progress of the project, and to all outward transfers ef- fected in respect of profits and dividends, repatriation of capital, and fulfillment of payments obligations. August 1. Exports of copra and of coconut oil were prohib- ited. August 2. For state foreign exchange banks, the definition of "liabilities denominated in foreign exchange" was broad- ened to include rupiah time deposits originating from foreign exchange and owned by resident or nonresident banks, as well as certificates ot deposit sold to nonresident banks. August 2. Rupiah time deposits originating from foreign exchange and owned by resident or nonresident banks, as well as certificates of deposit sold to nonresident banks, were 217 ©International Monetary Fund.

The export cesses on palm oil and rubber were increased. November 1. For all foreign exchange banks the definition of "liabilities denominated in foreign exchange" was broad- ened to include rupiah time deposits originating from foreign exchange and owned by nonbanks as well as certificates of deposit sold to nonresident individuals and institutions other than banks. 218 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Exchange Rate System Nonresident Accounts IRAN1 The par value is 0.0108055 gram of fine gold per Iranian Rial, corresponding to Rls 82.2425 = SDR 1 or Rls 68.1747 = US$1, and Iran avails itself of wider margins. The official rates for the U.S. dollar, the only currency that is officially quoted, are Rls 67.50 buying and Rls 67.75 selling, per US$1. Exchange rates for currencies quoted by the commercial banks 2 are based on these buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar and the exchange rates of the currencies con- cerned in London; the commercial banks are not permitted to quote buying rates of less than Rls 67.493 per US$1 or selling rates higher than Rls 68.850 per US$1, and on Decem- ber 31, 1973 their rates for the U.S. dollar were the same as those at the Bank Markazi Iran (the central bank), subject in certain cases to commissions. The central bank publishes daily exchange rates for 13 currencies 2 for purposes of the calculation of import registra- tion fees and import duties; these rates are based on the official rates for the U.S. dollar and the London market rates for the currencies concerned. Administration of Control Exchange control authority is vested in the central bank. In principle, all foreign exchange transactions must take place through authorized banks. The import and export of goods is governed by regulations issued annually by the Ministry of Economy and approved by the Council of Ministers. Import policy is formulated within an overall foreign exchange bud- get. Foreign trade relations with Albania are under the con- trol of the Foreign Transactions Corporation within the Ministry of Economy. Prescription of Currency Transactions with six of the nine countries with which Iran has bilateral payments agreements3 must be conducted through agreement accounts denominated in U.S. dollars, while those with the People's Republic of China, Eastern Germany, and North Korea must be conducted through ac- counts denominated in Iranian rials. Payments to and from Pakistan and Turkey relating to visible trade (excluding bor- der trade, petroleum and petroleum products, and defense materials) are settled over clearing accounts maintained by the respective central banks in U.S. dollars. Proceeds from exports to India may be accepted in Indian rupees. Payments to Rhodesia are prohibited. Settlements with other countries normally are settled in the quoted currencies (see footnote 2). 1 This survey presents the position on December 31,1973. Certain important developments that took place in January 1974 are summarized in a note at the end of the survey. 2 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. 3 Bulgaria, People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Hungary, North Korea, Poland, Romania, and U.S.S.R. Foreign nationals are permitted to maintain accounts freely, in rials as well as in foreign currencies, with authorized banks; rial accounts may be freely used only for payments in Iran, their conversion into foreign currencies being subject to central bank approval. Foreign nationals may also maintain time deposits in foreign currencies in Iran. Foreign currency accounts of foreign nationals may be used freely for transfers abroad or for sales to authorized banks, provided that such funds originate abroad. Iranian nationals may freely maintain time deposits in for- eign currencies in Iran; they also may freely retain, on current accounts with domestic banks, all foreign exchange they re- ceive other than export proceeds. Imports and Import Payments All imports into Iran are subject to control by the Govern- ment. The import policy is re-examined annually, and a new Import List, effective for the next Iranian year, is published by the Ministry of Economy. The Import List distinguishes between "authorized," "unauthorized," and "prohibited" goods. "Authorized" imports, consisting of nonluxury goods which either are not produced in Iran or are produced in Iran but not in quantities sufficient to meet domestic require- ments, are divided into two main categories: (1) imports for which orders may be placed without prior approval by gov- ernment agencies, 4 and (2) imports that are subject to prior approval by government agencies (generally the Ministry of Economy) before the import order is placed. "Unauthorized" imports are goods that may be permitted occasionally by the Ministry of Economy when the supply of the protected local product is considered insufficient. For "prohibited" goods, no authorizations are given; these comprise only a few items such as opium and firearms. Imports without payment of "authorized" goods require prior approval by the Ministry of Economy and the central bank; permission is given for the following: imports destined for official charitable institutions or government organiza- tions; machinery, spare parts, and raw or intermediate mate- rials for productive institutions, up to US$500 a shipment; and all other imports of "authorized" goods up to US$150 a shipment. The import of gifts, whether "authorized" or "unauthorized" commodities, is restricted to Rls 10,000 for each person a year. Specified commodities, such as sugar, tobacco, and ciga- rette paper, are imported under state monopoly. Unless otherwise specifically authorized, payment for all commercial imports must be made through the official ex- change market, with foreign exchange obtained from the banking system. Payments may be made either against bills for collection or documentary letters of credit. Payments against bills for collection may be made without authoriza- tion for goods (mainly capital goods and raw materials) listed 4 Exports and imports of goods that are not included in the bilateral export/import list for countries with which Iran has bilateral payments agreements require special approval by the Ministry of Economy. 219 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution IRAN in the Schedule attached to Circular No. 116 of August 3, 1965 (Iranian date 12.5.1344). Payments for imports of other goods required by domestic industries may also be made against bills for collection with special permission from the central bank. All other import payments must be made against documentary letters of credit. All orders for imports must be registered with the central bank through an autho- rized bank; registration is effected against a pro forma invoice. Imports from Rhodesia are prohibited and special regula- tions apply to certain commodities when originating in Hong Kong. No import registrations are accepted for commodities originating in Eastern Germany. At the time of registration of imports, an import registra- tion fee of 5.5 per cent of the amount of an import order, calculated on the basis of the official selling rate of Rls 67.75 per US$1, is collected by authorized banks. Imports brought in under the Law for the Attraction and Protection of Foreign Investment in Iran are exempted from the fee, as are some essential imports such as corn and certain vegetable oils. For goods for which payment must be made against a documen- tary letter of credit, importers must at the time of registration deposit with the central bank, through an authorized bank, a deposit of 100 per cent of the invoiced value.5 The deposit is reduced for many commodities to 40 per cent or 15 per cent, depending on their essentiality. The deposit is refund- able upon presentation of the customs clearance certificate after the respective goods have been cleared through customs, or if and when the order is canceled. The advance import deposit is not required for commodities which may be im- ported on a collection basis, whether they are in fact imported against a bill for collection or not. The central bank may permit the shifting of imports from the category in which an advance import deposit is required and financing must be on a letter of credit basis to the category in which bills for collection (with or without advance deposit) are permitted. Authorized banks make payments for permitted imports against the presentation of shipping documents. Approval of the shipping documents by the authorized banks represents approval of the foreign exchange transfer. Almost all imports are subject to commercial profit taxes, which are either specific or ad valorem and are in addition to any applicable customs duty. The ad valorem commercial profit tax ranges from 1 per cent to 200 per cent. Monopoly taxes are included in the commercial profit taxes. The author- ities specify in the Import List the commercial profit taxes for each year. These taxes are paid to the customs before customs clearance. The clearance through customs is authorized upon the presentation of shipping documents endorsed by the au- thorized banks, specifying that payment has been made or will be made, and, when required, that the special import authorization has been received from government agencies prior to lading of goods in the country of origin. 5 The registration deposit also is 100 per cent for all imports permitted under the Export-Import Regulations for the Iranian year 1352 that were unautho- rized in the Iranian year 1351. 220 Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles related to imports are made on the same basis as payments for those imports. Exchange is granted to merchants for insurance of imports against bills for collection; for imports covered by documentary letters of credit, insurance must be taken out in Iran. Exchange is not granted to merchants for insurance of Iranian exports sold f .o.b. Exchange is not granted for the payment of other insur- ance premiums, although reinsurance premium payments are permitted. Foreign nationals working in Iran as technical assistants whose employment has been recognized as neces- sary by the Government may take out in foreign exchange about 50 per cent of their net salaries. The travel allowance for Iranian nationals, the equivalent of Rls 50,000 a person a trip, may be made available by authorized banks upon presentation of a valid travel document and exit permit; each accompanying member of the passport holder's family is enti- tled to the same allowance, and there is no limit on the number of times an Iranian national may avail himself of this facility. Bona tide requests for additional funds in respect of business travel are granted liberally by the central bank. Banks may sell up to the equivalent of Rls 200,000 a person to Iranian nationals traveling or residing abroad, for medical treatment; additional foreign exchange can be obtained against medical bills certified by an Iranian consul abroad. In addition, authorized banks may at any time sell foreign exchange up to the equivalent of Rls 10,000 against a written request, to Iranian nationals for assistance to persons abroad, or for other personal use without the submission of support- ing documents, provided that the remittance is made in the form of a mail or telegraphic transfer; authorized banks charge a commission of Rls 130 on each such transfer. Iranian nationals may also freely make remittances abroad from do- mestic current accounts in which they retain foreign exchange received from sources other than exports; balances in such accounts are freely transferable. Purchases of foreign cur- rency from the banks for payments in respect of noncommer- cial invisibles not mentioned above require licenses from the central bank. Iranian nationals leaving the country are required to pay a travel tax of Rls 10,000 for each single-voyage exit permit, except for pilgrimage travel, for which the tax is Rls 3,000. Lower rates apply to family members traveling on the same passport (wife and children from 7 to 18 years of age), viz., Rls 750 a person for pilgrimages and Rls 2,500 a person for other travel. Iranians resident abroad and students studying abroad but visiting home temporarily are exempt from pay- ment of the tax. Travelers leaving Iran may take with them Rls 20,000 in Iranian banknotes. Travelers of foreign nationality may not export foreign currency in excess of the amount they im- ported less the amounts they have sold to authorized banks, as recorded in their passports; they may, however, convert rials up to the equivalent of US$100 into other currencies upon presentation of their visaed passport. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Rhodesia are prohibited. Exports of some com- modities require licenses. A commercial profit tax is imposed on a few exports, mainly consumer goods or raw materials. The commercial profit tax and customs duty charged at the time of import of raw materials contained in manufactured goods for export may be returned to the exporter after the export has taken place. Certain minor exports are granted incentive payments by the Center for the Promotion of Ex- ports. The central bank offers preferential discount facilities for export bills. The exporter must execute an exporters' commitment by which he undertakes to offer for surrender the foreign ex- change value of his exports, as appraised by the customs, within eight months after the goods have been exported. Au- thorized banks accept export proceeds only in specified cur- rencies (see footnote 2) or, for exports to India, in Indian rupees. Exporters who do not have foreign exchange proceeds from exports at their disposal may meet their surrender obli- gation by delivery of either foreign exchange from their own holdings or foreign exchange sold to an authorized bank by a third party; the central bank's permission is required to meet the surrender requirement through these alternative means. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles may be retained in a foreign currency account with an authorized bank, where they remain at the free disposal of the account holder (except for payments in respect of commercial imports). Travelers may freely bring in Rls 20,000, in Iranian bank- notes; higher amounts require the prior approval of the cen- tral bank. The repatriation of Iranian banknotes through the mail is not permitted. Nonresident travelers may sell their exchange only to an authorized bank at the bank's buying rate. Capital Iranian nationals may retain in domestic foreign currency accounts any capital receipts accruing in foreign exchange; transfers abroad from such accounts may be made freely (except for payments in respect of commercial imports), as may domestic transfers to other Iranian nationals. Transfers of capital abroad which would involve the purchase of foreign exchange from the banking system require the approval of the central bank; except as noted below, such approval is given only in exceptional circumstances. In accordance with the Law for the Attraction and Protec- tion of Foreign Investment in Iran (1955) and regulations implementing the law, foreign capital invested in approved development or productive activities in industry, mining, ag- riculture, or transport may be repatriated, together with net profits (in accordance with Article 1 of the Law for the At- traction and Protection of Foreign Investment and the provi- sions contained in the implementing regulations), in the form of foreign exchange and /or goods. Transfers of exchange must be made at the selling rate prevailing at the date of IRAN transfer. However, the central bank has the option of buying the exchange or accepting it as a deposit to be converted into rials at a rate mutually agreed upon in a separate agreement, and this rate is applicable to the funds when they are repatri- ated. Capital imported in the form of foreign exchange must be in currencies acceptable to the central bank; the exchange is converted into rials at the buying rate prevailing at the date of application for conversion. The law does not set up any limit of participation with respect to the ratio of foreign to domestic investment, but the Supervisory Board encourages participation by Iranians in the proposed investment. Gold No Iranian gold coins are legal tender. 6 Residents may freely and without license purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form in Iran. In practice, all imports of nonmonetary gold are made by the Bank Melli Iran (an authorized commercial bank) and exports are prohibited. The import and export of gold for monetary purposes or for international settlements is reserved for the central bank. Imports of gold for medical and dental purposes, for making medallions or medals, and to meet certain requirements of the Government may be made on the authorization of the Monetary Council through the Bank Melli Iran. Imports of gold and silver jewelry constitut- ing the personal effects of a traveler7 are permitted, as are imports and exports of gold coins in limited amounts by a traveler; the import and export of medals and medallions and of gold and silver coins for numismatic purposes requires the prior authorization of the central bank. Imports of gold are free from customs duty and commercial profit tax but are subject to the 5.5 per cent import registration fee. The weekly quotations of Bank Melli Iran for domestic sales include the import registration fee and a 4 per cent commission. Com- mercial imports of articles containing a minor quantity of gold, such as watches, require licenses issued by the Ministry of Economy. Changes during 1973 January 20. Since the receipt of short-term foreign ex- change credits was contrary to current policy of the central bank, banks were requested to provide the necessary foreign exchange to their correspondents abroad as soon as amounts under letters of credit, bills for collection, or payments orders were due. January 23. It was announced that the operation of foreign-owned oil companies in Iran would be terminated on the expiry of the current contracts in 1979. On March 21 the petroleum industry was nationalized. Negotiations with the oil consortium resulted in an agreement (signed into law on July 31), under which the companies concerned surrendered control of their producing assets immediately in return for 20-year contracts with the National Iranian Oil Company assuring them guaranteed supplies. 6 Article 2(d) of the Monetary and Banking Act prohibits the use of gold coins as legal tender. 7 Such jewelry must have a cost of production equivalent to at least one fourth of the total value; the assessment is made by the customs. It must also meet the requirements set by the Iranian Institute of Standards. 221 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution IRAN February 15. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the par value was maintained in terms of gold. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously Rls 75.75 = US$1, became Rls 68.1747 = US$1, and new official buying and selling rates were estab- lished at Rls 68.60 and Rls 68.85, respectively, per U.S. dol- lar. March 21. The control and supervision of public sector external borrowing and of foreign borrowing with an official guarantee was centralized in the Ministry of Finance. March 27. The Export-Import Regulations for the Iranian year 1352 were issued. The customs tariff was changed over to the Brussels Nomenclature. Most customs duties were changed from specific to ad valorem rates. Commercial profit taxes, which remained on a specific basis, were in some cases reduced to compensate for increases in the effective rate of customs duty. From time to time during the remainder of 1973 commercial profit taxes and customs duties on many items were reduced, the import ban for many items on the "unauthorized" list was lifted, and the import registration fee was abolished for some basic imports. April 8. A bilateral trade and payments agreement was signed with the People's Republic of China. It came into effect on September 2. June 9. The official buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were changed to Rls 67.50 and Rls 67.75, respectively. June 12. A number of foreign exchange allocations were increased. The annual travel allowance of US$500 or US$100, depending on destination, was raised to the equivalent of Rls 50,000, and this amount could be taken up for any num- ber of trips a year. The allocation for medical treatment abroad was increased from US$2,000 to the equivalent of Rls 200,000. The coverage of the facility under which autho- rized banks could at any time sell foreign exchange for personal remittances was increased from the equivalent of £ stg. 50 to the equivalent of Rls 10,000 for each transfer. The remaining effective surveillance over exchange transactions was limited in principle to capital movements. June 20. The amount in domestic banknotes that travelers could take out freely was increased from Rls 3,000 to Rls 20,000, and the amount they could bring in freely, which previously was unlimited, was also set at Rls 20,000. The import or export of higher amounts required the prior ap- proval of the central bank. July 23. The import registration fee was lifted for corn, certain vegetable oils, antibiotics, unprocessed pharmaceuti- cals, unwashed wool, and certain iron products. September 9. A bilateral trade and payments agreement was signed with North Korea. It came into effect on Decem- ber 19. September 25. A bilateral trade and payments agreement was signed with Eastern Germany. It came into effect on December 18. October 5. Iran notified the Fund that it would avail itself of wider margins. 222 October 17. Some 30 commodities were placed on a special list of goods requiring an export license. December 4. It was announced that outstanding foreign borrowings of the public sector with unsatisfactory terms would be paid off starting March 21, 1974. NOTE.—The following developments took place in January 1974. The text of the above survey has not been updated to take them into account. The central bank of Iran took the following measures on January 10 and 14, 1974, which it instructed banks in Iran to execute immediately: (1) Exporters were exempted from the obligation of execut- ing an exporters' commitment and were given an option ei- ther to sell their foreign exchange earnings to authorized banks at the official rate or to sell these proceeds in the "noncommercial free market." (2) Banks were allowed to purchase foreign exchange earn- ings resulting from exports and services at current market exchange rates and to sell this foreign exchange in any man- ner and for any purpose. (3) Banks could also purchase, either at their own discre- tion or on the basis of central bank regulations, the foreign exchange proceeds from capital transfers, and sell this ex- change in any manner and for any purpose. (4) The central bank stood ready to purchase at the official rate any excess supply of foreign exchange resulting from proceeds of exports and services. (5) Individuals and institutions wishing to sell to the cen- tral bank the foreign exchange proceeds from inward capital transfers and to repurchase these subsequently at the official rate for retransfer abroad, had to obtain the prior approval of the central bank and to abide by any existing regulations prior to making the inward transfer. (6) Provided they observed the relevant central bank regu- lations, banks could accept foreign currency deposits from any physical or juridical person and make use of such depos- its in any way they wished. (7) Foreign exchange purchased or accepted on deposit in accordance with the rules under (2), (3), and (6) would be referred to as "noncommercial foreign exchange," and banks were required to record the relevant transactions in a separate account. (8) The amount of "noncommercial foreign exchange" sold by any bank could not at any time exceed the amount it had purchased from customers. (9) In order to maintain an orderly exchange market, banks were required to compile, in a manner to be prescribed by the central bank, all data relating to the purchase and sale of foreign exchange, and to submit specified data to the central bank at the close of business on each Thursday and also at the end of each month. (10) The central bank's sales of foreign exchange to banks at the official rate for imports and other purposes would continue to take place on the same basis as previously. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution IRAQ Exchange Rate System The par value is 2.48828 grams of fine gold per Iraqi Dinar or ID 0.357143 = SDR 1, corresponding to ID 1 = US$3.3778, and Iraq avails itself of wider margins. Transac- tions in the official market are carried out in any of the listed currencies l or in Iraqi dinars through nonresident accounts in Iraq. The Central Bank of Iraq quotes official rates for the listed currencies for its transactions with authorized dealers. The Bank's buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar, which is the intervention currency, were US$3.394678 and US$3.377778, respectively, on December 31, 1973. Administration of Control The Board of Administration of the Central Bank of Iraq is entrusted with all powers and responsibilities in connection with exchange control; it has delegated this authority to the Foreign Exchange Committee (headed by the Governor of the Central Bank, his Deputy, or a member specified in ad- vance by the Board of Administration), to the Department of Foreign Exchange of the Central Bank, and to the licensed dealers. Foreign exchange transactions must take place through a licensed dealer unless otherwise authorized by the Board of Administration. Import and export policy are deter- mined by the Council for the Regulation of Trade. The Direc- torate-General of Economics (Government and Private Import Section) in the Ministry of Economy, the General Organization for Trade, the General Department for Indus- trial Promotion in the Ministry of Industry, and the Indus- trial Organization in the Ministry of Industry are the principal licensing authorities for imports and exports, but import licenses are also issued by certain other public organi- zations and government departments. A foreign exchange budget, including an import program, is established annually, and foreign exchange allocations under the import program are supervised by the Import Program Committee. Prescription of Currency Settlements must be made in any of the listed currencies l or, under the bilateral payments agreements with the People's Republic of China, Egypt, and Yugoslavia, in dinars or pounds sterling through the appropriate clearing account. Payments to and receipts from Israel, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts The opening of a nonresident account requires the approval of the exchange control authorities. Transactions permitted in convertible currencies may alternatively be settled in Iraqi dinars through nonresident accounts. Nonresident accounts are divided into ordinary nonresident accounts, which arise from transactions in respect of current payments, and special nonresident accounts, which arise from transactions in re- 1 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. spect of capital transfers. Furthermore, Iraqi nationals who have been working abroad for at least a year or who become residents after having been nonresidents may open accounts in foreign currencies with banks in Iraq and credit these with up to 50 per cent of their foreign savings. Balances in such accounts may be used for a variety of purposes, including imports for the holder's personal use, imports of certain capi- tal goods, or meeting expenditures abroad for travel, medical treatment, and study purposes; payments from these ac- counts up to the equivalent of ID 500 a year do not require Central Bank approval. Imports and Import Payments Imports of many commodities, including jute, sugar, tea, edible oil, certain medical supplies, machine tools, and auto- mobiles, are a government monopoly. All private imports except those of the private sector oil companies require li- censes; in principle these are issued in accordance with an annual import program, but this program has been made increasingly flexible, also for consumer goods. All imports from Israel, Rhodesia, and South Africa and all imports from Hong Kong other than certain essential goods are prohibited. Imports of some commodities on a Protection List are in principle prohibited from all sources. A tax is levied on the amount of the import license at the following rates: V2 per mill for producer goods, 1 per mill for consumer goods, and, in addition, up to 15 per cent on any supplementary import licenses above a private importer's an- nual quota. To finance the Export Subsidy Fund, a tax of V2 per cent is levied on imports of capital goods and a tax of 1 per cent on imports of consumer goods. All imports subject to import duty are also subject to a customs surcharge of 15 per cent of the applicable customs duty. Licensed dealers make exchange available upon presenta- tion of the exchange control copy of the import license, except in some instances where reference has to be made to the Central Bank. Payments for Invisibles With the exception of certain payments from foreign cur- rency accounts (see section on Nonresident Accounts, above), all payments for invisibles require permission. Exchange is usually granted for educational and medical expenses abroad, freight on exports carried on a c. & f. basis, insurance premi- ums, royalties, etc. Exchange is not granted to merchants for the insurance abroad of their imports or exports. Licensed dealers are permitted to transfer up to ID 50 a month for family maintenance on behalf of foreign nationals resident in Iraq, provided that remittances do not exceed half of the resident's monthly income; it is necessary to refer to the exchange control authorities for amounts exceeding this limit. There is a basic exchange allowance for tourist and busi- ness travel of ID 150 a calendar year for each person 18 years of age or over and of ID 100 for persons under 18 years of age, for trips of at least one week to Arab countries, socialist countries, Iran, and Turkey (ID 100 a person, irrespective of 223 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution IRAQ age, for trips of less than a week, or for five or more members of a family traveling together, irrespective of the length of their stay abroad). For travel to other countries, the basic allowance is ID 200 for each person 18 years of age or over and ID 100 for each person under 18, regardless of the length of the trip. In addition, there are special allocations of up to ID 1,000 a person for medical treatment abroad, and of ID 200 for persons accompanying a patient. Travelers may take out ID 5 in Iraqi currency notes, in addition to 50 per cent of the domestic currency equivalent of the foreign ex- change allocated, which is considered part of the basic travel allowance, and the balance of that allowance in travelers checks. Residents on a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia are permit- ted to take out the equivalent of ID 150 in listed currencies or in Saudi Arabian riyals (ID 75 for persons over 5 and under 18 and ID 25 for children 5 years of age or younger). Travelers leaving Iraq must deposit with an authorized bank 10 per cent of the Iraqi dinar equivalent of the foreign exchange granted. The deposit is refunded upon the travel- er's return to Iraq, subject to the fulfillment of certain formal- ities. Exempt from the deposit requirement are officials of government, semigoverament, and public utility depart- ments; students traveling for study purposes; pensioners; for- eigners, except non-Iraqi wives of Iraqi nationals; and persons leaving on a pilgrimage. On leaving the country, Iraqi nationals must pay an exit tax of ID 20, except when traveling to Gulf countries or on an official mission the entire expense of which is borne by the Government. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Hong Kong, Israel, Rhodesia, and South Africa and exports of certain goods to all other countries are prohibited. The Ministry of Economy has authority to pro- hibit the export of any commodity when supply falls short of domestic demand. The Council for the Regulation of Trade may also prohibit the export of certain commodities. All other exports are licensed freely. Exporters must generally undertake to repatriate their for- eign exchange proceeds through a licensed dealer and to sur- render them. Proceeds from exports of dates taken by sailing boats to countries of the Gulf area (excluding Iran) and India are exempt from these requirements when the amount does not exceed ID 600. Some commodities may be exported on a compensation (barter) basis. This system links the export of certain "new" exports to the import of prohibited items. Ex- ports of certain goods are subsidized through an Export Sub- sidy Fund. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange receipts from invisibles must be surren- dered to a licensed dealer. Travelers may bring in foreign exchange, including currency notes (other than Israel cur- rency), in unlimited amounts, provided that the funds are declared on an exchange control form; amounts not intended to be taken out of the country are exempt from declaration. Travelers may bring in ID 25 in Iraqi notes. 224 Capital Nonresidents may import capital freely, except from Israel, Rhodesia, or South Africa, but they must deposit it with a licensed dealer; such deposits may be converted into local currency at the official rate, and repatriation to the country of origin is permitted. With minor exceptions, foreign compa- nies starting operations in Iraq must use Iraqi capital to the extent of at least 51 per cent of their total capital. The transfer of profits net of income tax from foreign investments is lim- ited to 10 per cent per annum of the paid-up capital for trading companies, and to 20 per cent of the paid-up capital for industrial companies. These percentages are applicable for each year separately. They also apply to profits on capital resulting from the mandatory reinvestment of profits in ex- cess of the transferable percentage. Arab capital invested in Iraq is exempt from these percentage limitations and entitled to preferential treatment in several other respects; interest payments are not subject to any ceilings. All transfers of capital abroad by residents, whether Iraqis or foreigners, re- quire exchange control approval; such transfers are severely restricted. Special facilities allow Arab investors to bring in convertible currency freely through a licensed dealer for spec- ified investment purposes; such capital and any net profits may be transferred abroad in convertible currency. Similar facilities permit Iraqi nationals to bring in convertible cur- rency through a licensed dealer and deposit the funds in foreign currency accounts, balances in which are freely trans- ferable abroad. Under the Industrial Promotion Law (No. 22 of 1973), certain incentives and guarantees may be granted to approved investments of domestic or foreign capital in Iraq. Under the Iraqization Law of June 1961, all branches of foreign firms and all foreign-owned firms except banks 2 must have a ma- jority of equity capital held by Iraqi nationals; this law does not cover export agencies and operations requiring special skills. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in Iraq in any form other than gold bars. Imports and exports of gold in any form require the approval of the Central Bank. Since mid-1961, the Rafidain Bank has held a monopoly over the import and domestic distribution of gold needed for indus- trial purposes; it sells gold to registered goldsmiths only, under a quota system based on their past turnover of gold. Travelers may freely bring gold into Iraq, provided that it is declared at the point of entry on a foreign exchange form. Changes during 1973 February 13. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the par value was maintained in terms of gold. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously ID 1 = US$3.0400, became ID 1 = US$3.3778. Iraq continued to avail itself of wider margins. 2 All commercial banks and insurance companies were nationalized on July 14, 1964. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution IRAQ February 22. Law No. 22 of 1973, the Industrial Promotion Law, was published to replace Law No. 164 of 1964, the Industrial Development Law. The new law provided addi- tional incentives to national and foreign investment in Iraq, including special facilities for Arab capital. Among other things, foreign nationals could henceforth obtain ownership of land for approved projects. March 1. The austerity measures were relaxed and the restrictions on tourist travel abroad were lifted. April 1. The import program for 1973/74 came into effect. It made provision for imports valued at ID 350 million, about ID 100 million in excess of the initial allocations of the previ- ous year's program. A unified Protection List of 178 com- modities replaced the Prohibited Import List and the Suspended Import List. A list of 69 commodities specified the items that could be imported by the commercial private sec- tor. The import program was increased by ID 12.4 million in July, by ID 51.7 million in August, by ID 11.6 million in October, by ID 38.5 million in November, and by ID 25.0 million in January 1974. May. Iraq obtained observer status in the Council for Mu- tual Economic Assistance. July 15. The basic exchange allowances for travel abroad were increased. August. Restrictions on imports from the United States were eased. 225 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution IRELAND Exchange Rate System The par value is 2.13281 grams of fine gold per Irish Pound, corresponding to £Ir 0.416667 = SDR 1. Since June 23, 1972, however, the authorities have not maintained the exchange rate of the Irish pound within prescribed mar- gins, except for sterling. The Irish pound is at par with the pound sterling, and therefore all transactions, except those in sterling or currencies maintaining a fixed relationship with sterling, take place at a fluctuating exchange rate. Transac- tions in sterling take place at parity, free of any commission. As of December 31, 1973, the Central Bank's buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were US$2.3240 and US$2.3220 per Irish pound. Certain capital transactions in- volving investment currency (see section on Capital, below) take place at different effective rates. Forward transactions between authorized banks and their customers must have an underlying commercial transaction. On February 15, 1961, Ireland formally accepted the obli- gations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control Exchange control is operated by the Central Bank. Much of the authority for approving normal payments is delegated to commercial banks authorized for this purpose. Import licenses, where necessary, are issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce if the goods are of an industrial nature, or by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries if the goods are agricultural in character. Import licensing is not used for exchange control purposes. Import and export con- trols are administered by the Revenue Commissioners. Prescription of Currency Ireland is a member of the Sterling Area and continues to be a Scheduled Territory for the purposes of the U.K. Ex- change Control Act, 1947. Irish exchange control regulations distinguish between the Scheduled Territories, consisting of Ireland, the United Kingdom (including the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man), and Gibraltar; the External Account Area; and Rhodesia. Payments to and from other Scheduled Territories may be made freely in Irish pounds or pounds sterling; certain insurance payments between Scheduled Ter- ritories, however, may be made in foreign currencies. * Au- thorized payments to countries outside the Scheduled Territories other than Rhodesia may be made in Irish pounds or sterling through an External Account or in any foreign currency other than Rhodesian currency. The proceeds of exports to countries outside the Scheduled Territories other than Rhodesia must be received in Irish pounds or sterling through an External Account or in any foreign currency other than Rhodesian currency. The proceeds of permitted exports to Rhodesia must be received in foreign currency other than 1 Foreign currencies are all currencies other than those of a Scheduled Territory. 226 Rhodesian currency; payments to Rhodesia are subject to special regulations. Nonresident Accounts Accounts of persons resident in the Scheduled Territories are treated as resident accounts. Accounts of persons resident in countries outside the Scheduled Territories are treated as nonresident accounts and, with the exception of Rhodesian Accounts, are designated External Accounts. These may be credited with payments authorized for transfer to countries outside the Scheduled Territories other than Rhodesia, with transfers from other External Accounts in Irish pounds or in sterling, and with the proceeds in Irish pounds of any foreign currency other than Rhodesian currency sold by a resident of a country outside the Scheduled Territories to an authorized bank in Ireland. Balances on these accounts may be trans- ferred freely to other External Accounts in Irish pounds or in sterling, used for payments to residents of the Scheduled Territories, or converted through an authorized bank in Ire- land into any foreign currency other than Rhodesian cur- rency. Accounts held by or on behalf of residents of Rhodesia are designated Rhodesian Accounts. The opening of such ac- counts, and all debits and credits thereto, require the prior approval of the Central Bank. Imports and Import Payments All imports of commodities originating in Rhodesia re- quire a special license. With this exception, the import of goods into Ireland is subject to two types of administrative control. Under one type, which covers only a limited range of commodities for protective and other nonbalance of pay- ments purposes, imports of certain commodities are subject to quantitative restrictions, which, in most cases, are on a world-wide basis. 2 Individual import licenses are required for these goods and are used to limit the quantity of goods imported. In addition, special quota restrictions apply to cer- tain textiles and yams originating in any of 16 specified countries or territories. 3 All other imports are free of quanti- tative restriction. Under the other type of control, prior per- mission of the Central Bank is required before orders may be placed for goods originating outside the Scheduled Territo- ries, if they are not to be used in Ireland or are to be delivered more than nine months after the date of the order. For permitted imports, appropriate exchange or permis- sion to credit Irish pounds or sterling to an External Account is granted automatically. Exchange control forms are re- quired for import payments exceeding £lr 2,000 to countries outside the Scheduled Territories. 2 Most of the remaining quotas are being gradually increased in accordance with EEC commitments and with an obligation in the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement; the enlargements are made on a global basis, although the obligations relate only to goods originating in the United Kingdom and the other EEC countries. 3 Bulgaria, People's Republic of China, Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Japan, Macao, Malaysia, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, U.S.S.R., and Yugoslavia. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Payments for Invisibles Payments to the Scheduled Territories are not subject to exchange control unless they are for transactions outside the Scheduled Territories. Payments to residents of countries out- side the Scheduled Territories require approval. Approval to make payments for most invisibles is delegated to the autho- rized banks; for other invisibles, it is given by the Central Bank. For tourist travel outside the Scheduled Territories (other than to Rhodesia) there is a basic allowance for residents of the State of £lr 250 a person for each trip. For business travel, up to £Ir 1,500, at a rate of £lr 20 a day, is allowed for each journey. Limits are also established for allowances for educa- tion and other purposes. Applications for larger amounts are approved, provided that no unauthorized export of capital is involved. Not more than £lr 250 of an allowance of foreign currency may be issued in the form of currency notes. Persons traveling to destinations outside the United Kingdom (other than to Rhodesia) may also take with them up to £Ir 25 in Scheduled Territory currency notes. Travelers who are resi- dent outside the Scheduled Territories (other than Rhodesia) may take with them any foreign currency notes that they brought into Ireland. There is no restriction on the amount of Irish or other banknotes that may be taken to the United Kingdom. Exports and Export Proceeds A system of export licensing is applied to a limited range of goods. There is a special restriction on the export of a number of items to Rhodesia. Exporters of goods to countries outside the Scheduled Territories must obtain payment for the goods within six months of shipment, if the value of the goods exceeds £Ir 100. When payment is received in foreign currencies, the exchange must be offered for sale to an autho- rized bank. Exchange control forms are required for exports exceeding £lr 2,000 to countries outside the Scheduled Terri- tories. Proceeds from Invisibles There are no specific requirements governing exchange re- ceipts from invisibles, but if foreign currencies are received they must be offered for sale to an authorized bank or permis- sion for their retention must be obtained. Any foreign cur- rency held by a person after his return from a trip abroad may be retained for three months from the date he received the exchange, for use on a subsequent trip abroad. There are no limitations on the import of Irish or foreign banknotes. Capital Inward and outward movements of capital between Ireland and other Scheduled Territories are not subject to exchange control. Exchange control approval is required for all trans- fers of capital to countries outside the Scheduled Territories. Applications for transfer of capital at the official market rate of exchange by residents of the State emigrating to External Account Area countries (including the countries of the Over- seas Sterling Area) are approved up to a limit of £lr 20,000 IRELAND a family; there is no such allowance for emigration to Rhode- sia. Where the total value of an emigrant's assets exceeds £lr 20,000, the transfer of the excess amount is restricted for a period of four years from the emigrant's redesignation as a nonresident, i.e., from the date of departure from Ireland. After the four-year period, the assets are to be treated in the same way as those of non-Scheduled Territory residents who have never been resident in Ireland. However, permission is given at any time after redesignation for the restricted funds to be transferred outside the Scheduled Territories through the investment currency market (see below) or invested in sterling securities. 4 For Irish residents taking up employment and residence in an EEC country other than the United Kingdom, applica- tions are considered to transfer Irish or U.K. assets to their new country of residence in excess of £Ir 20,000; the addi- tional facilities are authorized at the official rate of exchange if they are shown to be appropriate to ensure the appli- cant's freedom to take up employment in the country con- cerned. Applications for the transfer of resident-owned capi- tal for purposes other than emigration are considered on their merits, but there are special facilities for residents taking up employment in EEC countries other than the United King- dom and for direct investment in such countries. There are no restrictions on the inflow of capital, but net inflows into the banks may be subject to guidelines set annu- ally by the Central Bank. Banks have been requested to de- posit with the Central Bank 50 per cent of any net capital inflows after January 16, 1973. Purchases of unquoted Irish securities by nonresidents of the Scheduled Territories require exchange control approval, and the purchase of nonurban land by foreign nationals in most cases requires approval by the Land Commission. Incoming capital received in foreign currencies must be offered for sale to an authorized bank. However, investment currency, i.e., the foreign currency pro- ceeds from the sale mainly of foreign currency securities 5 sold outside the Scheduled Territories may be fully reinvested in foreign currency securities, provided that the securities sold were held prior to April 7, 1965, or acquired by "switches" from securities so held, and that the investment is carried out within six months from the date of sale through a bank, a stockbroker, or a solicitor. Where the securities sold were purchased with investment currency on or after April 7,1965, 25 per cent of the sale proceeds must be surrendered at the official rate, except in the case of foreign currency securities payable in the currency of an Overseas Sterling Area country that on June 23, 1972 ceased to be a Scheduled Territory. Investment currency may be invested temporarily in for- eign currency certificates of deposit and similar paper with up to six months to run to final maturity, without incurring the need to comply with the 25 per cent requirement on maturity or resale, provided that the limit of six months for the holding of investment currency is not exceeded. In certain cases, the proceeds from the sale or liquidation of direct investments outside the Scheduled Territories (but not situated in a mem- ber country of the EEC) are regarded as investment currency 4 Securities solely payable in Irish pounds or pounds sterling. 5 Foreign currency securities are all securities expressed in the currency of a country outside the Scheduled Territories other than Rhodesian currency. 227 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution IRELAND and are eligible for investment in foreign currency securities, provided that 25 per cent of such proceeds is surrendered at the official rate. The entire foreign currency proceeds from the sale outside the Scheduled Territories of property for personal use owned by residents are normally regarded as investment currency where the whole of the property is sold; in other cases the 25 per cent requirement is applied. Residents may obtain, subject to individual permission, reasonable amounts of investment currency to purchase from non-Scheduled Ter- ritory residents property outside the Scheduled Territories for personal use; payments for attendant expenses and improve- ments must also be made with investment currency. Ap- proval is normally limited to one property a family. Purchases from residents of the Scheduled Territories must be settled in sterling. Transactions in securities are controlled to ensure that capital is not transferred outside the Scheduled Territo- ries. Direct investment outside the Scheduled Territories re- quires prior approval and, depending on the merits of the project, may be financed with investment currency, with offi- cial exchange, or by borrowing foreign currency. Use of official exchange is allowed, however, for all ap- proved new direct investments in EEC member countries other than the United Kingdom, subject to a limit of £Ir 250,000 a project a year, and applications to transfer larger amounts at the official exchange rate are considered on their merits. Dealings in Irish registered securities are permit- ted freely between residents of the Scheduled Territories. Spe- cific approval is required for all dealings by Irish residents in securities payable in Rhodesian currency. Remittances of cash gifts to Overseas Sterling Area countries that on June 23, 1972 ceased to be Scheduled Territories are normally permit- ted up to £Ir 1,000 a donor a calendar year; the corresponding limit for other External Account Area countries is £lr 250 a donor a year. Authorized banks may freely accept deposits in foreign currency from nonresidents of the Scheduled Territories and lend such deposits on to other nonresidents of the Scheduled Territories. Application must be made to the Central Bank for nonbank private sector borrowing from nonresidents of the Scheduled Territories; such applications are considered on their merits and on the benefit likely to accrue to the economy. Public sector borrowing outside the Scheduled Ter- ritories is undertaken following consultation with the Central Bank. Lending of Irish currency to nonresidents of the Sched- uled Territories is not normally permitted, except to the ex- tent that overdraft facilities may be provided by the banks to members of non-Scheduled Territories' diplomatic and con- sular missions in Ireland, and except that banks may freely make available loan and overdraft facilities in Irish pounds or sterling to residents of Overseas Sterling Area countries that on June 23,1972 ceased to be Scheduled Territories, provided the underlying transaction is a trade transaction or one asso- ciated with the movement of goods. Gold Residents may freely hold, buy, borrow, sell or lend gold coins in Ireland. Dealings in gold bullion are restricted, and no dealings take place in Ireland. Although there are no 228 import restrictions, residents require exchange control per- mission to purchase gold coins or bullion abroad; permission is normally given to numismatists for the purchase of gold coins. Exchange control permission also is required for the export of gold coins and bullion; this is not normally granted except to industrial users. Residents of Ireland are not per- mitted to hold gold abroad. Changes during 1973 January 1. Following a similar measure taken by the United Kingdom, it was announced that arrangements were being made under which Gibraltar would be redesignated a Scheduled Territory under Ireland's exchange control regula- tions. This came into effect formally on January 29. January 1. Ireland became a member of the EEC. The Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement remained in force. January 1. Certain measures to relax exchange controls between Ireland and member countries of the EEC other than the United Kingdom formally came into effect. These relax- ations had been in operation administratively for some months and were broadly in line with similar measures adopted by the United Kingdom. (1) Exchange control permission was still required for di- rect investments in the countries concerned. The use of offi- cial exchange would be allowed, however, for all new investments, subject to a limit of £Ir 250,000 a project a year, and applications to transfer larger amounts at the official rate of exchange would be considered on their merits. Since the relaxation would not apply retrospectively, the early repay- ment of foreign currency borrowing already undertaken and applied to existing projects would not be permitted. The foreign currency realized on a sale or liquidation of direct investments in the countries concerned, whenever made, would no longer normally be eligible for sale in the invest- ment currency market. Direct investments were defined as those where the Irish investing company participates in the management or operation of a project either directly or through the intermediary of a company or branch specially established in an EEC country for the purpose. (2) Applications would be considered from residents of Ireland who intended to take up employment in an EEC country, other than the United Kingdom, and who wished to be regarded as resident in their new country of employment, to transfer Irish or U.K. assets to their new country of resi- dence in excess of the previous limit of £lr 5,000. The addi- tional facilities requested would be authorized at the official rate of exchange if they were shown to be appropriate to ensure the applicant's freedom to take up employment in the country concerned. (3) Irish residents taking up temporary employment in EEC countries would, during the period of employment, still be regarded as Irish residents for exchange control purposes. The transfei of funds would be approved to meet such items as settling-in expenses, unforeseen current expenditure, and the cost of accommodation; authorities given would be lim- ited to amounts which were shown to be appropriate to en- sure the applicant's freedom to continue or take up employment in the country concerned. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution January 1. The first annual global quota open to the other member states of the EEC came into operation in respect of vehicles originating in the Community, other than those cov- ered by special treatment under the scheme applicable to the assembly and importation of motor vehicles. January 1. New global import quotas for a number of items came into force for the first half of 1973 (for the calendar year 1973 in the case of textiles and textile piece goods). February 1. Quantitative restrictions on trade between Ire- land and the United Kingdom in agricultural products cov- ered by a common market organization of the EEC were removed. February 6. All banks were requested to ensure that they bring about no net capital inflows by reference to the position as at mid-January 1973. It was proposed in this regard that at least 50 per cent of any net inflows that occurred after that date should be deposited with the Central Bank. Such depos- its would not be included when calculating primary liquidity ratios. These arrangements were still in force at the end of the year. February 12. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the Irish pound remained at par with sterling and continued to float. March 19. New exchange rate arrangements between the currencies of most member countries of the EEC, the Norwe- gian krone, and the Swedish krona came into effect. The Irish pound was not included and continued to float with sterling. March 26. All stock exchanges in the United Kingdom and Ireland were merged into an organization called The Stock Exchange. April 1. A revised customs tariff schedule took effect. The changes included the following: the first reduction, of 20 per cent, in duties on imports of industrial commodities imported from other EEC countries; a reduction of 20 per cent in duties on goods coming under the EEC regulation on beef and veal, together with the first step in the alignment of full, preferen- tial, and special preferential rates in the Irish tariff with the EEC Common External Tariff with respect to beef and veal IRELAND products; and the abolition of duty on imports of newsprint from all sources. There also were reductions in duties on specified imports from Austria, Iceland, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland, and on specified industrial products of United Kingdom origin. (The first tariff changes toward alignment of the EEC Common External Tariff did not take place until January 1, 1974.) April 1. The geographic coverage of Ireland's generalized system of tariff preferences was extended. July 1. Global import quotas for specified industrial items for the period to July 1, 1974 came into effect. July 1. A revised customs tariff schedule took effect. The changes included the eighth annual reduction in protective duties on imports from the United Kingdom under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement; a reduction of duty by 20 per cent on imports of certain agricultural commodities from member states of the EEC other than the United Kingdom; and reductions of duty on goods originating in specified countries having concluded trade agreements or association agreements with the EEC. August 27. The capital allowance available to emigrants taking up permanent residence in a country of the External Account Area (other than a country of the Overseas Sterling Area) was increased from £lr 5,000 to £Ir 20,000 a family unit and thus became identical with the allowance for Over- seas Sterling Area countries; emigrants to the countries con- cerned currently holding funds on blocked emigration accounts could apply to have up to £lr 15,000 of such funds released at the official rate of exchange. August 27. Applications would henceforth be considered from Irish residents taking up employment and residence in an EEC country other than the United Kingdom for the transfer at the official rate of exchange of their Irish or U.K. assets to their new country of residence in excess of the new emigration allowance of £Ir 20,000 (previously for amounts in excess of £Ir 5,000). December 28. The first postwar trade agreement with the U.S.S.R. was signed. It came into force on the date of signa- ture. 229 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ISRAEL Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.194884 gram of fine gold per Israel Pound, corresponding to l£4.56 = SDR 1. Israel has estab- lished a central rate of I £4.20 = US$1, corresponding to IC5.06665 = SDR 1, and avails itself of wider margins. The Bank of Israel's official buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar on December 31, 1973 were IE4.2000 and IE4.2030, respectively. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Department of Foreign Exchange Control of the Ministry of Finance, under the responsibility of the Controller of Foreign Exchange and in cooperation with other government agencies and is carried out through authorized banks. Prescription of Currency Payments and receipts must be effected in the currency and manner prescribed by the exchange control authorities. Set- tlements with countries with which payments agreements are in force ' are usually made in U.S. dollars as an accounting unit. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents' funds are held either on foreign currency accounts or on local currency accounts. The opening of non- resident foreign currency accounts does not require prior ap- proval. The principal type of nonresident foreign currency account is the PATACH account. The holder may freely effect transfers from his foreign currency account; he may also convert funds held in the account into local currency at the official rate of exchange. Local currency accounts of nonresidents are of two types: (1) Registered Accounts—for payments to and holdings of foreign aviation, shipping, insurance, and film companies and for nontransferable holdings of former residents—may be established only with special approval. Funds acquired from the sale of real estate and awaiting repatriation must also be held in Registered Accounts. Aviation, shipping, and insur- ance companies may freely convert at the official rate of exchange any amounts held on these accounts which are surplus to local requirements; film companies may do so under individual arrangements made with each company. Registered Account funds held by former residents may be used for investment in listed Israeli securities, for purchase of real estate, for tourist expenses in Israel up to an amount of I £250 a day for the account holder and for each member of his family, for remittances of up to I£l 5,000 a year in support of relatives who are residents of Israel, for the settlement of taxes payable in Israel by the owner of the account, and for donations to public and charitable institutions. Funds repre- senting the sales proceeds of certain real estate become trans- ferable after five years, in equal installments over the 1 Brazil, Bulgaria, and Portugal. 230 following five-year period. Ownership of Registered Ac- counts may not be transferred. (2) Other nonresident ac- counts in local currency may be used to hold funds derived from former investments that are eligible for transfer at the official exchange rate. Balances may be transferred freely be- tween nonresidents. The accounts may be liquidated at any time by the purchase of foreign exchange at the official rate; such foreign exchange may freely be transferred abroad or credited to a PATACH account. Funds in these accounts may also be used within Israel by conversion into Israel pounds, and no limit is placed on the amount that may be withdrawn. Israeli citizens who are temporarily living and earning abroad may maintain foreign currency in temporary PAMAZ accounts in Israel. Balances in such accounts may be freely used abroad when the holder is abroad; when he is in Israel he may only convert these funds into local currency at the official exchange rate. Resident Accounts in Foreign Currency Residents may maintain foreign currency deposits with authorized banks in Israel on either PAZAK accounts, which may be held by all recipients of foreign exchange other than those to whom exchange has been allocated from domestic sources, or TAMAM accounts, which may be held by recipi- ents of restitution payments and disability pensions. PAZAK accounts are demand or time deposit accounts denominated in convertible currencies. All foreign exchange receipts, except those derived from exchange allocations by the Ministry of Finance but including export proceeds, may be placed in PAZAK accounts. Account holders may retain foreign exchange in this manner or may exchange it into local currency. Account holders may use foreign exchange bal- ances in PAZAK accounts to make any authorized foreign payments. Balances in PAZAK accounts are not negotiable between residents, but only among members of the immediate family of the account holder. TAMAM accounts also are demand or time deposit ac- counts in convertible currencies. One third of convertible exchange receipts derived from personal restitution payments and from pensions, etc., of disabled soldiers who served dur- ing World War II may be credited to TAMAM accounts. The permitted uses of TAMAM accounts include the following: (1) the purchase through the medium of the authorized bank holding the account of foreign securities denominated in con- vertible foreign currency that are registered on a stock ex- change in specified foreign countries; (2) payment of premiums on existing life insurance policies denominated in foreign currency; (3) payment of expenses in connection with travel and subsistence abroad in excess of the basic travel exchange allocation of the equivalent of US$450 a trip, pro- vided that not more than the equivalent of US$1,800 a year is drawn by the account holder and for each member of his family; and (4) payment of legal expenses resulting from resti- tution claims. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NATAD accounts are transfer accounts in foreign ex- change that are used mainly for transactions in foreign securi- ties. As stated above, holders of TAMAM accounts may purchase abroad foreign securities denominated in convert- ible foreign currency and registered on a stock exchange in specified foreign countries. Foreign securities thus acquired may be traded freely between residents, through the interme- diary of the authorized bank that is the depository, against payment either with NATAD or TAMAM funds or in Israel pounds. If the original buyer resells securities bought with TAMAM account funds for foreign currency he may deposit the proceeds in TAMAM accounts. Residents who are not holders of TAMAM accounts may deposit the foreign ex- change proceeds from the sale of foreign securities in NATAD accounts. Balances in NATAD accounts may be used to purchase further foreign securities but are not nego- tiable between residents. If foreign securities are sold between residents against Israel pounds, the conversion factor used to establish their domestic currency value is the so-called NATAD rate. On December 31,1973, it stood at I£5 per U.S. dollar. Imports and Import Payments A few imports are prohibited from all sources and all im- ports from Rhodesia are prohibited. All commodities whose importation is not liberalized are listed in a Negative List. Imports of goods listed in the Free Import Orders are free of all licensing and administrative or quantitative restrictions. All other imports are subject to licensing. For commodities on the Automatic Approval List, licenses are issued automat- ically upon application. All other permissible imports consti- tute the Restricted List. All individual import licenses must be countersigned by the Department of Foreign Exchange Control of the Ministry of Finance. The currency and method of payment are prescribed in each license; if a convertible currency is prescribed, payment may be made in any convert- ible currency. Six basic food products (frozen meat, milk powder, wheat, oilseeds, edible fats, and sugar) are imported exclusively by or for account of the Government of Israel. Exchange to pay for items listed in the Free Import Orders or to pay for licensed imports is granted automatically. If payment is to be made by documentary credit, the foreign currency required may be purchased at the time of opening the credit. Funds not transferred abroad immediately must be deposited in a special account with the Bank of Israel until transfer is made. Licenses are not issued for imports of goods on consignment unless the recipient of the license imports goods valued at US$100,000 within three months and under- takes to deposit 10 per cent of the value of the goods in local currency with the Bank of Israel through an authorized bank. Each license is valid only for a single commodity, and an importer cannot receive more than two such licenses a year. The approval of the Department of Foreign Exchange Con- trol is required for all imports effected under foreign credits. Importers are required to deposit with the customs, at the time of paying the import duty and for a period of six months, 20 per cent of the c.i.f. value of imports. 2 Exempt are com- 2 The deposit requirement was abolished with effect from January 1, 1974. ISRAEL modities subject to customs duty at a rate of less than 50 per cent, imports by or for the Government, immigrants' per- sonal effects, gifts, and imports with a c.i.f. value of I £5,000 or less. The funds are kept on deposit in the Bank of Israel for six months and interest of 6 per cent a year is received by the importer. Virtually all imports are subject to an import surcharge of 25 per cent of the c.i.f. value. The main exemp- tions are for fuels, certain basic foodstuffs, and uncut dia- monds. A purchase tax is levied on almost all imported and domestically produced goods, other than capital goods. Payments for Invisibles Most payments abroad for invisibles require individual licenses. Each resident is allowed exchange equivalent to US$10-250, which is obtainable on demand, for certain pur- poses such as the purchase of books, membership dues, and registration in a university. For tourist travel abroad, there is an exchange allowance equivalent to US$450 a traveler for each journey (US$225 for children under 12); emigrants are not eligible for this allowance. Not more than I£200 in Israel banknotes may be taken out by travelers. Foreign tourists leaving Israel are permitted to repurchase through authorized dealers foreign currency up to US$30. Residents traveling abroad must pay a travel tax; for travel by sea, the tax is I£550 plus 10 per cent of the price of the ticket, and for travel by air, I£595 plus 10 per cent of the price of the ticket. Travelers to specified countries are exempted from the travel tax; these include Cyprus, Ethiopia, and Romania. Exporters doing more than US$100,000 of export business a year are exempt from travel tax on business trips. Immigrants and their families are exempt from travel tax for three years from the date of immigration or of entry as temporary residents. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Rhodesia are prohibited. Most exports do not require licenses if paid for in freely convertible currencies. For some commodities, however, export licensing is retained for the purpose of quality control. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry maintains a check on export transactions with a low value-added content which are made with bilateral partners; this is done to discourage switch transactions. Ex- port proceeds in foreign currencies must be surrendered or held in a PAZAK account. Exports of most commodities are eligible for incentive payments based on value added and designed to rebate estimated internal indirect taxes and the import surcharge. At the end of 1973, the payment for dia- monds was about 81 agorot per US$1 equivalent, and for other commodities the payment ranged from I£l.05 to I£l.21 per US$1 equivalent, with the higher rates applicable to com- modities with a higher proportion of domestic value added. For inputs directly imported by an exporter there is a system of rebate of customs duties, wharf charges, etc. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange proceeds from invisibles must, in general, be surrendered. Alternatively, they may be kept in foreign ex- change on PAZAK accounts, balances on which may be 231 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ISRAEL exchanged into Israel currency at any time or used to make authorized payments abroad. Any resident is free to accept specified convertible currencies from tourists in payment for services and commodities other than commercial exports, securities, and real estate; such receipts must be surrendered within a few days. One third of the foreign exchange received by residents of Israel as restitution payments, and as pensions by disabled soldiers who served in World War II, may be retained in TAMAM accounts and the other two thirds may be held in PAZAK accounts. For ten years after entering Israel, new immigrants are exempt from surrendering their foreign exchange to the Trea- sury, and they may keep these foreign currencies with autho- rized banks in Israel or with banks abroad. Tourists visiting Israel are expected to bring with them the amounts of foreign currency that they will need during their stay. Not more than I£200 in Israel banknotes may be brought in by travelers. Tourists and others visiting Israel who are holders of Registered Accounts (see section on Non- resident Accounts, above) may draw upon such accounts to the extent of I£250 a day for themselves and the same amount for each member of their families; if they are holders of other nonresident local currency accounts, they may draw on them without limit. Capital Foreign exchange representing incoming capital and be- longing to a resident must be surrendered at the official rate or held in a PAZAK account. Capital brought into Israel for the purpose of investment may, subject to approval, be granted preferential treatment in accordance with the Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments of August 16, 1959, which, inter alia, permits a nonresident who has made an "approved** investment in foreign currency to transfer all his profits abroad in the same currency at the official rate. Repayments and amortization of capital may also be trans- ferred on the following terms: if the investment has been kept for less than five years, the capital may be w i thdrawn in five equal installments; if the investment has been kept for more than five years, it may be withdrawn immediately. Current policy is to grant "approved** status only to enterprises in selected fields of production that fulfill one of the following conditions: (1) that they are established in "priority areas**; (2) that they are export-oriented, i.e., either at least 50 per cent of output is exported or existing productive capacity is increased by at least 50 per cent while at least 50 per cent of the additional output is exported; or (3) tha t, although for economic reasons the enterprise cannot be established in a priority area, its production is of the import-substitution type. There is no longer any difference between an "approved investment** and any other investment made by a nonresident in foreign currency insofar as his rights to transfer abroad the principal or the interest or profits on his investment are con- cerned. The difference does still exist as regards other bene- fits, such as income tax concessions and grants. The principal of foreign investments made prior to January 1, 1958, or made after that date in foreign exchange, can be 232 transferred abroad. The proceeds of investments in real es- tate, however, can only be transferred five years after its purchase, in five annual installments. Proceeds accruing from the repatriation or liquidation of foreign assets held by residents are treated in the same way as proceeds from invisibles. Any resident may retain real estate abroad, but not money, securities, or the income from real estate; new immigrants may retain liquid assets as well. Transfers abroad of a capital nature by residents other than new immigrants are generally not permitted. Owners of TAMAM deposits are entitled to purchase for- eign securities registered at stock exchanges in specified for- eign countries. Foreign securities purchased to the debit of a TAMAM deposit can be sold abroad by their owners, or in Israel either against foreign currency to owners of other TAMAM or NATAD deposits or against Israel pounds. The proceeds of the sale may be credited to the TAMAM account previously debited for the purchase. The owner of foreign securities bought through TAMAM or NATAD accounts is also allowed to sell them to residents against Israel pounds, and the purchaser in his turn may sell them either against Israel pounds or against foreign currency (abroad or to hold- ers of TAMAM or NATAD deposits); he is entitled to de- posit the foreign currency proceeds in a NATAD account. This is the only manner in which NATAD accounts can be established. The holder of a NATAD account may draw on it to pur- chase foreign securities abroad, or to pay to a holder of a TAMAM or NATAD account foreign currency for foreign securities. It is also permissible to purchase gold from monies in TAMAM and NATAD accounts, the procedure being the same. A general license allows authorized dealers to purchase real estate in Israel for nonresidents. Nonresidents may freely purchase shares, provided that purchases are financed with converted foreign currency; debentures, however, may be purchased by nonresidents only if they are quoted on the Tel Aviv stock exchange. Direct loans in any form to or from nonresidents are subject to licensing. Gold Residents, including private persons, may freely hold gold in any form either in Israel or abroad; purchases by private persons must be financed out of TAMAM or NATAD ac- counts, except for purchases of jewelry and of articles con- taining a minor quan t i ty of gold, such as watches. Gold can be sold only to an authorized dealer and can be bought only from an authorized dealer. Other residents are forbidden to trade in gold, to transfer it from place to place, or to take it out of Israel. Imports of gold are permissible only if an import license is obtained. Imports of gold for industrial purposes are transacted by five importing wholesalers. These wholesalers may sell the gold only to purchasers registered with the Pur- chase Tax Administration. The latter checks these purchases by each manufacturer against the gold content of products marked as "purchase tax paid** in order to eliminate the possi- bility of sales of these quantities of gold on the market as bullion. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Changes during 1973 January. By amendment to the Commodities and Services (Control) (Control of Diamonds) Order, 1959 and the Im- ports, Exports and Customs Jurisdiction Ordinance, 1939, the controls on the diamond trade were tightened. January 1. The import deposit in domestic currency that importers were required to lodge with the customs, at the time of paying the import duty and for a period of six months, was reduced from 30 per cent to 20 per cent of the c.i.f. value of the goods. Goods with a c.i.f. value of up to I£5,000 became exempt from the deposit requirement. January 14. As part of the five-year import liberalization program, customs duties on some 1,350 items, mostly indus- trial consumer goods, were reduced by an average of 15 per cent. January 30. An interim trade agreement with the EEC was signed for the period to the end of 1973. February 8. The amount up to which funds held in Regis- tered Accounts by former residents could be used for travel expenses in Israel was increased from I £150 a day to I £250 a day (for the account holder and each member of his family), and the amount up to which they could be used for remit- tances in support of relatives resident in Israel was increased from I£5,000 a year to I£l5,000 a year. February 8. The amount in Israel banknotes that travelers could bring in and take out was increased from I£100 to I£200. February 8. Israeli exporters were allowed foreign exchange equivalent to 10 per cent of their foreign sales but not exceed- ing US$50,000 for marketing and other incidental expenses. February 8. The import privileges accorded to new immi- grants were revised. They were no longer required to pay for purchases with their own foreign exchange. February 8. Authorized banks were permitted to buy and sell foreign currencies at spot rates deviating from the official buying and selling rates quoted by the Bank of Israel. February 8. The basic foreign exchange allowance for study abroad was raised from the equivalent of I£150 to I£250 a month. Family remittances abroad up to US$400 a year no longer required documentary verification. February 14. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Israel established a central rate of I£4.20 = US$1 and continued to avail itself of wider margins. ISRAEL The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar remained unchanged. February 25. Import duties on some 1,500 items, mainly industrial products, were reduced by 10 per cent to 15 per cent to offset the price effects of recent exchange rate changes .3 March 23. The amount up to which funds held in TAMAM accounts by residents could be used for travel and subsistence abroad in excess of the basic travel exchange allocation was increased from the equivalent of US$1,200 a year, to the equivalent of US$1,800 a year, for the account holder and each member of his fam i ly. March 27. The exchange rate for the Jordan dinar in the West Bank territory was changed from I £ l l . 76 = JD 1 to I£12.75 = JD 1. April 2. The Bank of Israel directed that a negative interest rate of 12 per cent per annum should be levied on nonresi- dents' holdings of specified foreign currencies held in nonresi- dent foreign currency accounts in excess of balances on February 19, 1973. This directive was revised every week as to currencies and rates. The negative interest rate was abol- ished for most currencies on April 5, 1973. It was abolished for the last remaining currency, the Belgian franc, on Janu- ary 6, 1974. May 15. Retroactive to January 1, 1973, premiums paid to exporters were increased by a graduated 2 per cent to 23 per cent of export sales revenue, equivalent to about I £5 per US$1 of value added. June 15. The temporary import du ty surcharge was ex- tended un t il April 1, 1974. August 1. Export incentives were fu r ther increased by the equivalent of seven agorot per US$1 of value added. September 13. The rules governing imports on a consign- ment basis were eased. November 5. The import surcharge was increased from 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the c.i.f. value of the goods. No changes took place in the list of exemptions from the sur- charge. The process of liberalization of imports was not af- fected. Import du ty on footwear, furn i ture, cigarettes, and a few household items was increased by 20 per cent. Purchase tax on most goods was increased by 5 per cent, and on some luxu ry items by 10 per cent or 20 per cent. December 27. The Ministry of Commerce and Indus try issued an order abolishing the import deposit scheme with effect from January 1, 1974. 3 In January 1974, import duties on most goods were reduced by 2.5 per cent to 8 per cent as stage two of the import liberalization program. 233 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ITALY l Exchange Rate System 2 The par value is 0.00142187 gram of f ine gold per Italian Lira, corresponding to Lit 625 = SDR 1, and a central rate of Lit 581.500 = US$1 has been established, corresponding to Lit 631.343 = SDR 1. All exchange transactions, however, take place at f luc tua t ing rates in a dual exchange market. Current transactions are channeled through the ordinary ex- change market (mercato valutario ordinario or mercato del conti valutari ordinari) and capital transactions through the financial exchange market (mercato valutario finanziario or mercato del conti valutari finanziari) from other Special Accounts, and with the proceeds from sales of investments that have been made in accordance with Law No. 43. They may be debited for purchases in the finan- cial exchange market of the same currency that was originally sold and for investments in Italy, and balances on them may be transferred to Capital Accounts or to any other Special Account Under Law No. 43. Imports and Import Payments All imports of Rhodesian origin are prohibited. Practically all imports from other countries except Japan, the People's Republic of China, North Viet-Nam, and the CMEA countries are free of quantitative restriction; all goods, how- ever, require a bank certificate for submission to the customs authorities and sometimes also a license issued by the Minis- try of Finance at the request of the Ministry of Foreign Trade. Commodities that still require individual licenses when im- ported from these other countries are included in a negative list (Tabella A Import. 4 Some items in the list require an import license only when originating in Israel or Yugoslavia. The general permission to import goods not included in the Tabella A Import applies to Egypt and Yugoslavia only if the goods both originate in and are shipped direct from the coun- try concerned; in addition, in respect of imports of raw cot- ton, rice, and crude petroleum from Egypt, the payee must reside in that country or in one of the European OECD countries. (Seventy per cent of the value of other imports from Egypt must be paid to creditors residing either in that country or in any OECD country, and 30 per cent must be paid in lire to Egypt's lire account with the Italian Exchange Office.) A more extensive negative list (Tabella B Impori) contains those commodities which require an individual license when originating in and imported from Albania, Bulgaria, the Peo- ple's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Hungary, North Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, the U.S.S.R., or North Viet-Nam. There is a special list of com- modities, also included in Tabella B Import, whose importa- tion is unilaterally and de facto liberalized when they both originate in and are shipped from Albania, Bulgaria, the Peo- ple's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, or the U.S.S.R. These goods may be admitted by the customs without a license, although some require a visa issued by the Institute of Foreign Trade. A separate negative list applies to Japan indicating the goods that are subject to restrictive import licensing when imported from that country; some other items are included in a special list of commodities for which import licenses are issued freely. All other goods of Japanese origin 5 may be imported freely without an individual license, irrespective of the country from which they are shipped.

For imports not exceeding Lit 1 million in value, no ex- change control form is required; for imports from Lit 1 mil- lion to Lit 2 million in value, a form completed by the importer is required; for imports over Lit 2 million in value, an import document completed by an authorized bank is required. The importer must choose an authorized bank as his bank of domicile, through which he must carry out all pay- ments operations related to his import transactions if settle- ment takes place more than 360 days after importation. Advance payments for imports require special approval when they are to take place more than 30 days before importation. All advance payments of Lit 1 million or more must be made with foreign currency borrowed from Italian authorized banks. For all authorized imports, the authorized banks provide exchange or permit payment in Italian lire to a Foreign Ac- count, provided that appropriate payment terms are observed (see section on Capital, below). International postal money orders may be used for import payments, subject in the case of payments to Switzerland to a limit of Lit 100,000 for each remitter and foreign beneficiary. Payments for Invisibles In principle, payments abroad for invisibles require licenses issued by the exchange control authorities. Under general authorization, however, the authorized banks may sell foreign exchange freely, provided that the necessary documents are submitted. Exchange is granted freely for remittances of earn- ings on investments. Residents may use international postal money orders for payments, subject in the case of payments to Switzerland to a limit of Lit 100,000 for each remitter and foreign beneficiary. All advance payments of Lit 1 million or more for imports of services must be made with foreign cur- rency borrowed from Italian authorized banks. Certain transactions (but not the related payments) in re- spect of services are subject to approval by the Ministry of Foreign Trade or the Ministry of Industry. These transac- tions can be divided into two groups: (1) contracts which require a permit if they involve residents of specified countries 8 and (2) contracts which require a permit regard- less of the nationality of the nonresidents involved. The first group includes transactions giving rise to expenditures for chartering ships (excluding charters for a single trip); repairs to ships which are not urgent and not necessary for safety of operation; news agencies and newspaper correspondents (for amounts exceeding Lit 5 million a month for the same payee); purchases of publication rights, information agencies, etc. (for amounts exceeding Lit 5 million for each contract); copy- rights (for amounts exceeding Lit 5 million a year for each contract); services of professional workers and company managers (for amounts exceeding Lit 5 million); and services of entertainers and athletes (for amounts exceeding Lit 5 6 Albania, Bhutan, Bulgaria, People's Republic of China (including Mongo- lia), Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Hungary, Khmer Republic, North Korea, Poland, Romania, U.S.S.R., North Viet-Nam, and (only for chartering ships) Yugoslavia. 235 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ITALY million). The second group includes transactions giving rise to expenditures for production abroad of films, utilization of films, scripts, synchronization, etc.; collaboration in cinema- tography; insurance of ships and aircraft against risks of oper- ation; 7 and other transactions not permitted by general au- thorization (when the amounts involved exceed Lit 1 million). Residents traveling to foreign countries may obtain from the banks exchange equivalent to Lit 500,000 for each trip for tourism, business, medical treatment, and education (the cor- responding amount for group travel also is Lit 500,000); banks are authorized in exceptional cases to supply foreign exchange above these allowances, up to Lit 1 million a person a trip, provided that they are satisfied that this is justified in the light of the duration and purpose of the trip. Applications for exchange in excess of Lit 1 million a person a trip must be submitted to the Exchange Office. To the extent that he refrains from obtaining an allocation of foreign exchange, a resident traveler may take in addition a proportionate amount in Italian banknotes, up to Lit 20,000. 8 Nonresident travelers may take out any amount in foreign banknotes that they have previously declared upon en t ry as well as Lit 20,000 in Italian banknotes. Foreign banknotes must be purchased in the financial exchange market, while payments with other means of payment, including travelers checks, and credit cards are settled in the ordinary exchange market. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to any country of a few commodities in a special list (Tabella Esport) require export licenses. For exports not exceeding Lit 1 million in value, no exchange control form is required; for exports from Lit 1 million to Lit 2 million in value, a form completed by the exporter is required; for ex- ports exceeding Lit 2 million in value, an export document completed by an authorized bank is required. The exporter must choose an authorized bank as his bank of domicile, through which he must carry out the payments operations related to his export transactions if settlement takes place more than 90 days after exportation. Unless special approval is obtained for different terms of payment (see section on Capital, below), 90 per cent of ex- change receipts must be collected within 90 days of shipment, and these must be offered for sale to an authorized bank w i th in 7 days of receipt, while 10 per cent must be collected within 24 months of shipment. Proceeds in U.S. dollars, Ca- nadian dollars, Japanese yen, and externally convertible Eu- ropean currencies may be retained by authorized banks on behalf of the recipients in Ordinary Foreign Currency Ac- counts (Conti Valutari Ordinari) for one mon th, during which period such balances may be used for permitted trans- actions or be sold to authorized banks; the banks are allowed to sell these currencies to residents for authorized transac- tions or to negotiate them freely with the Italian Exchange Office or among themselves. 9 After expiration of the reten- tion period, unused balances must be sold to the Italian Ex- change Office at the lowest ordinary market exchange rate quoted during the retention period (these ordinary market rates are determined daily on the basis of the average closing rates in Milan and Rome). Export proceeds may also be received by international postal money order, up to Lit 100,000 for each payment, and in certain circumstances, in foreign banknotes that are accepted in the country of issue for credit to bank accounts, balances in which are convertible at official market rates. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from current invisibles are subject to the same collection, retention, and surrender requirements as receipts from exports. 9 Shipping and insurance companies and travel and forwarding agencies may keep operating accounts (Conti Autorizzati) in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, Japanese yen, and externally convertible European currencies. Residents may not retain any foreign banknotes left over from trips abroad but must sell them to an authorized bank. Persons may bring in any amount in foreign banknotes and Lit 20,000 in Italian banknotes. Foreign banknotes may be sold in the financial market only; settlements with travelers checks and credit cards take place at ordinary market rates. Capital Capital transactions between residents and nonresidents must in principle be settled in the financial market. Medi- um-term loans granted or received by Italian banks in con- nection with imports or exports of goods and services are settled in the ordinary exchange market. Inward and outward movements of nonresident capital are free. However, loans of any kind from nonresidents to resi- dents and from residents to nonresidents require specific au- thorization from the Ministry of the Treasury or the Ministry of Foreign Trade, respectively, except, with regard to OECD countries, long-term loans (other than loans from financial institutions to nonresidents) for the purpose of establishing or maintaining lasting economic relations and loans to relatives up to the third degree of relationship, and, with regard to EEC countries, short-term (up to one year and not exceeding Lit 250 million) and medium-term (up to five years and not exceeding Lit 250 million) financial loans (i.e., loans not con- nected with commercial operations or the performance of services); for none of these is any kind of authorization re- quired. Repayment of such loans may be made freely. A deposit requirement is applicable to outward transfers of resident-owned capital for direct investments, portfolio in- vestments, financial loans, purchases of real estate, and per- sonal capital movements. The transferor must lodge a lira deposit equivalent to 50 per cent of the amount transferred (25 per cent for investment fund securities, but mutual funds investing entirely in Italian securities are exempt) in a nonin- terest-bearing account with the bank effecting the transfer. In addition, when foreign investments are transferred between 7 Such transactions need authorization by the M in is try of Indus t ry. 8 Persons living in border areas may not take out more than Lit 20,000 a day in foreign and domestic banknotes and coins combined, of which foreign notes and coins must not exceed the equivalent of Lit 10,000. 9 Foreign currency may be retained in Ordinary or Financial Foreign Exchange Accounts un t il the second weekday after the end of the first calendar mon th following that in which the individual exchange receipt concerned was credited to the foreign exchange account. 236 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution residents against lire, the transferee is subject to the deposit requirement, regardless of the date when the investment was made. The deposits are released only when, and to the extent that, disinvestment operations occur, and their release re- quires the prior approval of the local Bank of Italy office. Purchases by residents of certain bonds issued by specified EEC institutions are exempt. Outward direct investment transactions have from time to time been given an ad hoc exemption. Foreign investment in Italy is, in principle, governed by Law No. 43 of February 7, 1956 and subsequent implement- ing regulations. Foreign investments of any kind in Italy, including both direct and portfolio investment and the pur- chase of real estate, are permitted freely, and no restrictions are applied to their repatriation. Direct investment in OECD countries by physical or juridi- cal persons (other than participation by a financial institution that has its main office in Italy in a foreign company not having the same corporate purpose), is permitted in any form and without any limit. 10 Direct investment in other countries may be made only (under the supervision of the Italian Ex- change Office) by juridical persons in firms that are in the same line of business as that of the Italian firm mak ing the investment; other types of direct investment in such countries require special authorization from the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The general license to make these investments also covers the reinvestment of earnings and the use for this pur- pose of the liquidation proceeds of previous investments (af- ter crediting the proceeds of the disinvestment to bank accounts similar to those established for proceeds from ex- ports and invisibles; see section on Proceeds from Invisibles, above). Residents of Italy are free to buy and sell, through the Bank of Italy or the authorized banks, any foreign securities issued or payable abroad and quoted on foreign stock ex- changes, and to deal in such securities among themselves against payment in lire. Such foreign securities, except securi- ties of Lit 100,000 or less, have to be deposited with an Italian bank or with a bank abroad for account of an Italian bank. The purchase by residents of shares of foreign financial insti- tutions of any kind (including mutual funds), as well as con- vertible bonds issued by such institutions, requires prior approval by the Italian Exchange Office. In practice, how- ever, a resident is able freely to purchase shares of foreign funds that have received authorization from the Ministry of Foreign Trade to sell their shares in Italy, since that authori- zation is in fact valid also for the individual resident sub- scriber. Such authorization is given only to funds meeting certain requirements, including that of investing at least 50 per cent of their portfolio in Italian securities and that of setting up a branch office in Italy. Residents do not require authorization to purchase real estate in EEC countries. All issues of securities by nonresidents on the Italian capi- tal market require the prior approval of the Ministry of For- eign Trade, and are subject to the rules governing the issue 10 Financial investment, i.e., investment not intended to establish permanent relations, is not considered direct investment, pie regulations governing direct investment are also not applicable to participations in "holdings" abroad of any kind. ITALY in Italy of domestic securities. These rules include the prior approval of the Bank of Italy, and, for issues beyond Lit 500 million, that of the Ministry of the Treasury, the Ministry of Indus try, and the Interministerial Credit Committee. Issues are normally restricted to international institutions. Transfers in connection with donations, inheritances, and dowries may be made freely. The transfer of property of residents leaving Italy permanently is allowed in two stages: up to the equivalent of Lit 6 million a person upon presenta- tion of specified documents to an authorized bank at the time of leaving Italy, and the remainder subject to examination of the documents by the Italian Exchange Office, when resi- dence has been established abroad. Special regulations apply to commercial credits and credits related to the performance of services. Advance payments for imports must be made with foreign currency borrowed from an authorized Italian bank; in other cases, the prior approval of the Ministry of Foreign Trade is required. When prepay- ments for imports exceed Lit 5 million, an advance deposit of 5 per cent is required. Deferred payments for imports are permitted freely if settlement is to take place, to the extent of at least 90 per cent, within 360 days after importation, and the balance within 24 mon ths after importation; such pay- ments require the prior approval of the Italian Exchange Office if the settlement is to take place between 12 months and 24 months after importation. In all other cases, the prior approval of the Ministry of Foreign Trade is required; where, according to the contract, settlement is to take place more than 360 days after the date of importation, the approval of the Ministry is required to make the payment prior to the due date set in the contract. Advance payments for exports may be received freely if exportation is to take place within 360 days; in all other cases, such receipts require the prior approval of the Italian Ex- change Office. Deferred payments for exports are permitted if settlement is to take place to the extent of at least 90 per cent within 90 days after exportation, and the balance within 24 months after exportation. For settlement between 90 and 360 days after exportation, the approval of the Exchange Office is required; in all other cases, such receipts require the prior approval of the Ministry of Foreign Trade. Virtually identical regulations are in force for the permitted credit terms for imports and exports of services. In relations w i th EEC countries, the reciprocal granting of credits for commercial transactions or the performance of services, with a ma tur i ty longer than the time limits that banks are authorized to approve and up to five years, may be effected after examination of the documents by the Italian Exchange Office. This applies also in relations with Austria, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. Loans and credits (the latter only beyond a certain dura- tion, generally 180-360 days) not connected with commercial transactions or with the performance of services require the approval of the Ministry of Foreign Trade. However, finan- cial loans may be granted to or by residents of EEC countries as indicated above. The export of Italian and foreign securities is permitted only when they are owned by nonresidents and have been purchased against U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, Japanese 237 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ports of goods; transport and communications (freight, har- bor dues and unloading charges, postal and cable charges, etc.); charges for the services of intermediaries (bank charges and fees, payments to forwarding agents, payments to com- modity dealers, etc.); contributions to expenses of branches, representative offices, and news agencies; advertising ex- penses; construction, repairs, and modernization (buildings, roads, bridges, ports, ships, etc.); insurance and reinsurance, including indemnifications, contributions, and annuities; pen- sions and remuneration for work (including prizes, authors1 copyrights, contributions in newspapers and films, patents, etc.); expenses of travel and sojourn; payment of interest, dividends, etc.; and miscellaneous (emigrants* remittances, taxes, duties, membership fees, contributions and subsidies, legal expenses, maintenance of real estate, etc.). Permitted debits to Capital Accounts (related to the finan- cial market) included those in respect of the following: con- version into foreign currency in the financial market; transfer to a Special Account Under Law No. 43 of February 7, 1956 of lire stemming from foreign currency sold on the financial market for investment in accordance with that law; amortiza- tion of loans in lire by nonresidents; donations and endow- ments; dowries; inheritances and bequests; capital funds and annuities certain owed by insurance companies operating abroad for life insurance policies; foreign investments in Italy in securities and real estate; loans in lire from nonresidents to residents; other financial transactions allowed under the regu- lations in force; transfer to a domestic account (conto interno) when the holder of the account transferred his residence to Italy; and transfer to another Capital Account. January 22. The system of nonresident lire accounts was reorganized. Capital Accounts henceforth related to the fi- nancial exchange market only and Foreign Accounts to the ordinary exchange market. Correspondingly, two types of resident foreign currency accounts were henceforth distin- guished: Ordinary Foreign Currency Accounts (Conti Valutari ITALY yen, or externally convertible European currencies, or against funds on a Capital Account. The net external position of the banks is subject to control by the Exchange Office. This control encompasses (1) the spot position vis-a-vis nonresidents in foreign currencies and lire together; and (2) the overall position, spot and forward combined, in all foreign currencies; a balanced foreign cur- rency position on a daily basis is required separately in (a) U.S. dollars, (b) EEC currencies, and (c) all other conto valu- tariocurrencies combined. Authorized banks are permitted to incur a net foreign liability position and are prohibited from ma in ta in ing a net foreign asset position. Gold All transactions in gold between residents and nonresi- dents are settled in the ordinary exchange market. Residents may freely hold and negotiate gold in any form in Italy, w i th the exception of unrefined gold imported under ministerial license for industrial purposes. The monetary authorities may freely acquire unrefined gold abroad. Agent banks that have been authorized by the Ministry of the Treasury may acquire unrefined gold abroad upon submission of licenses issued by the Ministry of Foreign Trade to Italian firms for industrial use. Exports of wrought and semimanufactured gold, other than jewelry, are subject to licensing. Impor ts of unrefined gold are subject to value-added tax at 12 per cent. Imports of gold coins for numismatic purposes are subject to value-added tax at 18 per cent. Changes during 1973 January 2. The import regulations applicable to EEC mem- ber countries became applicable also to Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, except for goods covered by com- mon market organizations of the EEC, for which this oc- curred on February 1. January 2. A value-added tax came in to effect. It replaced the cascade-type turnover tax. January 5. Borrowing and lending between residents of I ta ly and residents of Austria, in respect of imports of Aus- trian origin and exports to Austria, with maturities in excess of those which banks could approve but not in excess of five years, henceforth were permitted subject to prior examination of documents by the Exchange Office. A corresponding mea- sure w i th respect to Sweden and Switzerland was taken on January 18, 1973, and with respect to Finland and Norway on March 6, 1974. January 22. A dual exchange market came in to operation. Current transactions were to be channeled through the ordi- nary exchange market, where IMF and EEC margins would continue to be observed, while capital transactions were to be settled in the financial exchange market, where quotations would be freely determined by supply and demand. The exist- ing exchange control regulations, including those of June 28, 1972 concerning Italian banknotes, were maintained (with the exceptions mentioned in the following January 22 entries). Payments and receipts eligible for the ordinary market included those in respect of the following: imports and ex- funds held in Special Accounts Under Law No. 43 for trans- fer abroad following disinvestment had to be channeled f irst into a Capital Account. Foreign Currency Accounts in existence on January 20, 1973 were designated Ordinary Foreign Currency Accounts. Capital Accounts in existence on the same date became sub- ject to the new rules for Capital Accounts. Capital Accounts could be held w i thout special authoriza- tion, at any Italian bank, by persons resident abroad. They could be credited with lire derived from: the sale of foreign currency on the financial market; loans in lire to nonresidents (except loans made under Law No. 131 of February 28, 1967); sales of securities and real estate by nonresidents; amortiza- tion by residents of loans in lire obtained from nonresidents; gifts and endowments; dowries; inheritances and bequests; capital funds and annuities certain payable to nonresidents by insurance companies operating in Italy, on account of life insurance contracts; other financial operations allowed by the existing regulations; transfers from domestic accounts moti- vated by a change in residence of the holder of the domestic account to a foreign country; transfers from other Capital Accounts; transfers from Special Accounts Under De- cree-Law No. 211 or Under Law No. 43 for the transfer abroad of the amount concerned; and interest on amounts credited to Capital Accounts. Capital Accounts could be debited for: conversion into foreign currency in the financial market; transfers to Special Accounts Under Law No. 43 of lire derived from the sale of foreign exchange on the financial market for purposes of investment as defined by that law; amortization by nonresi- dents of loans in lire; gifts and endowments; dowries; inheri- tances and legacies; capital funds and annuities certain payable by insurance companies operating abroad under life insurance contracts; foreign investment in Italy in securities and real estate; loans in lire from nonresidents to residents; other financial operations allowed by the existing regulations; transfers to domestic accounts motivated by the transfer to Italy of the residence of the holder of the account; and trans- fers to other Capital Accounts. The same debits and credits were permitted to Financial Foreign Currency Accounts held by residents. Lire amounts corresponding to the utilization of lines of credit granted to nonresidents for operations of a financial nature had to be credited to a Capital Account in the name of the beneficiary, and the lire required to reimburse this financing had to be drawn also from a Capital Account. Forward transactions against lire carried out with nonresi- dents in connection with financial operations had to be closed on ma tur i ty with lire from a Capital Account. Banks had to effect spot or forward cover for forward operations against lire in the same exchange market in which the underlying operation was to be effected at maturity. Swap operations against forward lire had to be concluded with lire drawn from an account of the same type as that to which the lire were credited when the swap operation was initiated. All outstand- ing drawings on lines of credit in lire granted by Italian banks to nonresidents had to be paid off on maturity with lire from Foreign Accounts. All existing forward operations against ITALY lire also had to be paid off on ma tur i ty with lire from Foreign Accounts. "Financial operations" were defined as all operations that could not be documented as being of a commercial or service nature. January 22. The period normally allowed for advance pay- ments for imports was reduced from 90 days to 30 days prior to importation; as a result, payments 31 days to 360 days (five years for EEC countries) prior to importation were subject to prior examination of documents by the Exchange Office. The period within which export proceeds must normally be col- lected was reduced from 360 days to 90 days after shipment; as a result, collection 91 days to 360 days (five years for EEC countries) after exportation was subject to prior examination of documents by the Exchange Office. The shortened collec- tion period was applicable to 90 per cent of the export pro- ceeds, while 10 per cent remained subject to the previous term of 24 months after exportation. January 22. The period during which authorized banks were permitted to retain export proceeds in foreign currency accounts (conti valutari) on behalf of the recipients was re- duced from six months to one month after collection. This was applicable also to foreign currency accounts in the finan- cial market (see below). January 22. The use for the financing of current noncom- mercial transactions of existing lines of credit obtained abroad henceforth was subject to prior examination of docu- ments by the Exchange Office, provided that each transaction was to take place w i th in 180 days. January 29. Banks were informed that swaps of lire against foreign currencies could take place in the financial market only, and that outright forward transactions in lire against foreign currencies w i th foreign correspondents could not be effected in the ordinary market unless there was a specific underlying commercial or services transaction. February 1. Transactions in foreign banknotes denomi- nated in specified convertible currencies were shifted to the financial market; these were banknotes in the 10 out of 16 conto valutario currencies that, when repatriated to the coun- try of issue, could be credited to bank accounts, balances in which were convertible at the official exchange rate. Transac- tions in travelers checks and settlements through credit cards remained in the ordinary market. February 1. The basic foreign exchange allocation for travel abroad was reduced from Lit 1 million a person a trip to Lit 500,000 a person a trip. The corresponding ceiling on the export of Italian banknotes and travelers checks denomi- nated in lire by resident travelers also was reduced from Lit 1 million to Lit 500,000 a person a trip. Banks could in exceptional cases grant foreign exchange up to Lit 1 million a person a trip if this in their view was justified in the light of the duration and purpose of the trip; applications for allo- cations in excess of Lit 1 million a person a trip had to be submitted to the Exchange Office. February 2. Banks were informed that the conversion of other means of payment into foreign banknotes had to be effected through a separate sale against lire. 239 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ITALY February 8. It was clarified that debits to Capital Accounts for transfers to Special Accounts Under Law No. 43 were permitted. February 13. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Italy announced that for the time being the exchange rate for the lira in the ordinary market would not necessarily be confined within announced limits either in respect of the U.S. dollar or in respect of EEC currencies. Henceforth, the exchange rates in both exchange markets were fluctuating rates. February 19. The period within which export proceeds (as well as proceeds from current invisibles) in foreign currency had to be deposited in a foreign currency account or offered for sale to the Exchange Office was reduced from one mon th to seven days after receipt. February 19. The period within which holders of Financial Foreign Currency Accounts were required to offer for sale to the Exchange Office any unused foreign exchange held in such accounts was shortened to the second weekday after the end of the first calendar mon th following that in which each individual credit en try was recorded. February 19. Since the crediting and debiting of Authorized Accounts for capital movements had been prohibited by Cir- cular No. A /262 of January 20, the holders of such accounts were permitted to credit and debit Financial Foreign Cur- rency Accounts for the purposes for which the use of their Authorized Accounts had been permitted prior to Janu- ary 20. February 19. Applications for the modification of ministe- rial authorizations for the granting of commercial credit could be submitted to the Exchange Office, provided that they were necessary for the execution of the transaction and did not change the basic structure of the transaction. February 21. The Special Accounts of international organi- zations and institutions were divided into Ordinary Special Accounts and Financial Special Accounts, related to the ordi- nary market and the financial market, respectively. February 23. Banks were instructed that the sale of foreign currency to nonresident travelers leaving Italy was to be lim- ited to the amount and currency previously sold against lire by the traveler concerned. February 23. Banks were informed that the screening of applications for the authorization of the acceptance or issu- ance of guarantees vis-a-vis nonresidents in respect of certain types of transactions was with effect from March 1 being taken over by the Exchange Office. (On April 13 the Ex- change Office took over the screening of all guarantees vis- a-vis nonresidents, whether of a banking nature or not.) March 1. Specified foreign exchange transactions con- nected with the making of films that previously required ministerial authorizations henceforth only required a declara- tion of nonopposition (nulla osta) from the Exchange Office. March 11. Imports of many goods originating in Eastern Germany were liberalized. The degree of liberalization ac- corded to that country was approximately the same as that already enjoyed by most Eastern European countries and the People's Republic of China. March 15. When its dollar swaps with Italian authorized banks began to fall due, the Italian Exchange Office informed 240 them that it would settle the swaps only in part but, in order to compensate the banks for continuing to hold the dollars, would pay them a premium of up to 1.50 per cent on repay- ment. March 20. The Exchange Office renewed its dollar swaps with authorized banks. On April 11 it began to unwind them in part. On June 13 the remaining swaps were extended for a fur ther three months and the Exchange Office again offered banks a premium to compensate them for interest rate differ- entials. On July 2, a further unwinding of the swaps took place. March 27. Applications for foreign exchange for resi- dents temporarily living abroad for reasons of study, etc., had to be submitted to the Exchange Office when in excess of Lit 500,000 a mon th. April 1. Imports from non-EEC countries of tape recorders were restricted. April 9. The Exchange Office reminded banks of the limits on bank advances in lire to residents and nonresidents, in- cluding advances in respect of the discounting of bills denom- inated in foreign currencies. April 12. A law providing for exchange risk guarantees for Italian exporters was approved. April 19. Settlements in respect of imports from and ex- ports to Eastern Germany became subject to the normal procedure applicable to any other country. April 30. Banks were prohibited, except on the basis of ministerial authorizations, from opening credits for imports of tape recorders from countries that are not members of the EEC. May 8. The supervision over the use of imported unrefined gold was tightened. July 27. Payments for imports and services contracted on a deferred payment basis (for settlement more than 360 days after the date of importation) could no longer be made at any date earlier than the one agreed in the contract, unless the prior approval of the Ministry of Foreign Trade was ob- tained. July 27. A deposit requirement was introduced against outward transfers of resident-owned capital for direct invest- ments, portfolio investments, financial loans, purchases of real estate, and personal capital movements. The transferor had to lodge a lira deposit equivalent to 50 per cent of the amount transferred (25 per cent for investment fund securi- ties, but an exemption was granted to mutual funds investing entirely in Italian securities) in a noninterest-bearing account w i th the bank effecting the transfer. The latter had to pass the deposit on to the Bank of Italy. In addition, when foreign investments were transferred between residents against lire, the transferee was subject to the deposit requirement, irre- spective of the date when the investment was made. The deposits were released only when, and to the extent that, disinvestment operations occurred, and their release required the prior approval of the Exchange Office. (On September 21, this approval authority was shifted to the local Bank of Italy offices with which the deposits have been lodged.) Exemp- tions from the deposit requirement were subsequently granted on a case-by-case basis for certain direct investment operations and by exchange control circular for residents' ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution subscriptions to certain bond issues of financial institutions of the EEC. July 27. Certain reporting requirements were introduced for "money brokers" operating in Italy as intermediaries in transactions in foreign exchange, securities, etc., with foreign countries. July 30. Advance payments for imports of goods and ser- vices could be made only with foreign exchange borrowed from authorized Italian banks. July 30. Banks, which (although permitted and encouraged to incur a negative overall external position) already had to maintain a balanced overall foreign currency position (overall position in conto valutario currencies, spot and forward com- bined), were required to keep balanced foreign currency posi- tions separately in U.S. dollars, EEC currencies, and all other conto valutario currencies combined, on a daily basis. August 3. An exemption from the deposit requirement against outward investments of Italian capital was given for the subscription to, and the transfer against lire between residents of, shares of mutual funds authorized to operate in Italy that specifically undertook to comply with the condition that the increase of investments in Italy after July 30, 1973 would never be less than the total new net savings taken up in Italy by the fund concerned. August 21. The limit up to which credit cards could be used abroad was raised to 80 per cent of the basic exchange alloca- tions for travel for purposes of tourism, business, study, or health. August 29. Prepayments for imports of goods and services valued at less than Lit 1 million were exempted from the requirement that foreign exchange should be borrowed from authorized banks; the facility was not applicable where the payment formed part of a larger transaction. September 7. An exemption from the deposit requirement was granted for purchases by residents of securities of the European Investment Bank (EIB), limited to new issues ad- mitted for placing in Italy; a similar exemption was granted on November 8 for bonds issued by the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) after the en try into force of the Min- isterial Decree of July 27, 1973, an exemption limited to those loans of which a part had been or would be allowed to be placed in Italy; bonds from the portions of those loans placed in other countries could be purchased free from deposit once they were quoted on the foreign stock exchanges concerned, and this was made applicable also to the EIB securities men- tioned in the regulation of September 7. October 9. Controls were imposed on exports of certain petroleum products to non-EEC countries. On November 15 ITALY these controls were extended to other petroleum products and applied also to the EEC countries. October 22. In connection with the fiscal reform, a require- ment was introduced that the shares of all companies located on Italian territory must be registered. Previously, companies in certain regions with a special constitutional status were exempt. November 8. Residents' purchases of all bonds issued by the ECSC and EURATOM after the en try in to force of the special deposit requirement (see July 27, above) were ex- empted from the deposit. NOTE.—The following changes took place early in 1974: January 1. A new tax law came into effect. Among other things, it introduced a 15 per cent withholding tax on interest payments, but it exempted bank deposits held by nonresident banks from this tax. February 3. The amount of the swap agreement between the Bank of Italy and the U.S. Federal Reserve System was increased from US$2 billion to US$3 billion. March 5. The Bank of Italy announced that public sector borrowing in the Euro-markets had amounted to US$5.6 billion in the second half of 1973. March 5. It was announced that notes to be issued shortly by the ECSC would not be eligible for exemption from the deposit requirement against capital outflows. March 8. The amount of Italian banknotes that resident and nonresident travelers could freely bring in or take out was reduced to Lit 20,000 a person a trip (previously Lit 500,000 for departing travelers and unlimited upon entry); for persons living in border areas, the same daily limit was applicable for imports and exports of Italian banknotes, but within this limit they could take out foreign banknotes and coins up to the equivalent of Lit 10,000. The foreign exchange allowances to residents for all types of personal foreign travel were main- tained unchanged but henceforth had to be marked in the traveler's passport. Furthermore, returning residents no longer were permitted to retain any leftover foreign bank- notes or travelers checks for subsequent use. Additional re- porting requirements were introduced for certain outward remittances. March 12. Medium-term loans granted or received by Ital- ian banks in connection with imports or exports of goods or services, whether expressed in lire or in foreign currency, henceforth had to be settled in Foreign Account lire or in foreign currency related to an Ordinary Foreign Currency Account. Previously, such loans were settled through the financial exchange market. 241 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution IVORY COAST Exchange System No par value for the currency of Ivory Coast has been established with the Fund. The un it of currency is the CFA Franc, 1 which is officially maintained at the rate of CFAF 1 = 0.02 French franc. Exchange transactions in French francs, the intervention currency, between the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de 1'Ouest (BCEAO) and commercial banks take place at the rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02, free of commissions. Exchange transactions relating to countries other than France, Monaco, and the countries whose ins t i tu te of issue is linked to the French Treasury by an Operations Account take place in a dual exchange market, at rates based on the fixed rate for the French franc and the Paris exchange rate for the currency concerned in either the official exchange market or the financial f ranc market. Settlements eligible for the official exchange market are payments and receipts in respect of imports, exports, and most other current transactions, as well as all current payments by or in favor of domestic and foreign public authorities and public bodies. All other settlements w i th foreign countries, as well as all transactions in bank- notes, take place through the financial franc market at freely f luc tua t ing rates. The principal current payments and receipts channeled through the financial franc market are those relat- ing to travel expenses, capital earnings, and workers' remit- tances. Exchange rates for certain European currencies in the official market are based on par values and central rates; the effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar in this market is not confined w i th in any announced margins. With the exception of those relating to gold, Ivory Coast's exchange control measures do not apply in financial relations w i th (1) France and its Overseas Departments and Territories (except the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is l inked w i th the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the People's Republic of the Congo, Dahomey, Gabon, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Togo, and Upper Volta). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries, except Ivo ry Coast itself, are considered foreign countries, and in principle financial relations only w i th foreign countries are subject to exchange control. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Directorate of External Finance and Credit of the Directorate-General of Public Accounts and the Treasury in the M in is try of Econ- omy and Finance, which also supervises borrowing abroad, the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securi- ties in Ivory Coast, foreign inward direct investment, and all ou tward investment in foreign countries. The BCEAO is au- thorized to collect any informa t ion necessary to compile the balance of payments statistics, either direct or through the 1 The CFA f n > nc is issued by the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de POuest (BCEA«J, and is the common currency in Dahomey, Ivo ry Coast, Niger, Senegal, Togo, and Upper Volta. 242 intermediary of banks, other financial institutions, the Postal Administration, and notaries public. All exchange transac- tions relating to foreign countries must be effected through authorized banks or the Postal Administration. Import and export licenses are issued by the Directorate for Licenses and Foreign Trade Regulations in the Directorate-General of Economic Affairs and External Economic Relations. Import attestations for liberalized commodities are made out by the importer himself. Prescription of Currency Ivory Coast is an Operations Account country of the French Franc Area, since the BCEAO maintains an Opera- tions Account with the French Treasury; settlements with France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories, except that of the Afars and the Issas), Monaco, and the other Operations Account countries of the French Franc Area are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other Operations Account country. Settlements with all other countries are usually made through correspondent banks in France in any of the currencies of those countries or in French francs through Foreign or Financial Accounts in Francs. All settlements with Rhodesia are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. BCEAO banknotes may be credited to Financial Accounts in Francs when they have been mailed direct to the BCEAO agency in Abidjan by authorized banks' foreign correspondents. Otherwise, the crediting to nonresident accounts of such banknotes is pro- hibited. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Rhodesia are prohibited. Certain imports f rom the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Portugal are suspended. A few imports from all sources are prohibited (e.g., a specified type of coffee-husking machine and wheat flour) or subject to import license (e.g., sugar, paints, matches, and detergents). Imports of certain com- modities, including rice, are linked to purchases of the domes- tic product. All other imports from countries in the French Franc Area may be made freely. Virtually all imports origi- na t ing in EEC countries other than France or shipped from those countries also are free from quantitative restrictions and free of license; the exceptions are some 16 items on a special list. As a rule, imports from non-EEC countries outside the French Franc Area require import licenses and may be made in accordance w i th an import program, which is determined annua l ly by the Directorate of Economic Affairs and Exter- nal Economic Relations. Under this program, semiannual global quotas are established for imports from such countries and special quotas for imports from countries with which Ivory Coast maintains bilateral trade agreements. 2 The pro- 2 These inc lude Republic of China, Denmark, Egypt, Hungary, Israel, Japan, No rway, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution gram also includes indicative quotas for the EEC countries and a quota for Hong Kong and Eastern European countries. The quotas establish limits up to which import licenses may be issued, for specified commodities, to licensed importers and, in exceptional cases, to industrial or agricultural produc- ers who are considered as end-users of the imported goods. Certain products, contained in separate liberalized lists, may be imported freely from any source, from the former OEEC countries, or from Canada and the United States, respec- tively. All import transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value ex- ceeds CFAF 500,000; transactions of lower value must be domiciled if a financial transaction is to be undertaken before customs clearance. The import licenses or import attestations entitle importers to purchase the necessary exchange, but not earlier than eight days before shipment if a documentary credit is opened or eight days before the payment is due if the commodities have already been imported. Payments for Invisibles Payments to Rhodesia are prohibited. Payments for invisi- bles to France, Monaco, and the other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to approval. Payments for invis- ibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authoriza- tion. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted freely when the basic transaction has been approved. Any resident may freely and at any time make remittances abroad up to the equivalent of CFAF 50,000 w i thout indicating their purpose. Residents traveling to countries other than France, Monaco, and the other Operations Account countries of the French Franc Area may obtain an exchange allocation for tourism of an amount equivalent to CFAF 175,000 a person a year (CFAF 87,500 for children under ten); any foreign exchange remaining in excess of CFAF 5,000 after return to Ivory Coast must be surrendered. The transfer of the full basic salary of a foreigner work ing in Ivory Coast is permitted upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher, provided that the transfer takes place w i th in three months of the pay period. Resident and nonresident travelers going to foreign countries may take out BCEAO banknotes up to CFAF 25,000. Travel- ers to other Franc Area countries may take out any amount in BCEAO banknotes, but if going to a country that is not a member of the West African Monetary Union, the amount taken out must be declared to the customs if it exceeds CFAF 150,000. Nonresident travelers going to foreign countries may freely take out foreign banknotes and coins up to the equivalent of CFAF 175,000 as well as any travelers checks, etc., issued abroad. Subject to documentation, they may also take out any amount of travelers checks, etc., in foreign currency es- tablished in their name after conversion of foreign currency into CFA francs or drawn against a Foreign Account in Francs or a foreign currency account in Ivory Coast. Nonresi- IVORY COAST dents who have made a currency declaration upon entry or are able to show the proper banking notices may take out higher amounts. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Rhodesia are prohibited. Most exports are free of license and require a declaration only. Exports of agricultural commodities, however, require the visa of the Directorate for Licenses and Foreign Trade Regulations. Ex- port proceeds received in currencies other than those of France or another Operations Account country must be sur- rendered within two months of the due date, which must not be later than 180 days after the arrival of the goods at their destination. All export transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank when valued at CFAF 500,000 or more. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France, Mo- naco, and other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be collected and surrendered within two months of the due date or the date of receipt. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of banknotes and coins issued by the BCEAO, the Bank of France, or any bank of issue maintaining an Opera- tions Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign banknotes and coins (except gold coins) of countries outside the French Franc Area; residents bringing in foreign banknotes or other foreign means of payment must sell any amount in excess of CFAF 5,000 to an authorized bank within eight days and must declare them to the customs upon en try. Capital All capital movements between Ivory Coast and Rhodesia are prohibited. Capital movements between Ivory Coast and France, Monaco, and other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require exchange control ap- proval, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. Special controls (additional to any exchange control re- quirements that may be applicable) are maintained over bor- rowing abroad, over foreign inward direct investment, over all outward investment in foreign countries, and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Ivory Coast; these controls relate to the transactions them- selves, not to payments or receipts. With the exception of those relating to foreign securities, these control measures do not apply to relations with France and its Overseas Depart- ments and Territories (except the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas), Monaco, the other member countries of the West African Monetary Union, and those other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account. Special controls are maintained also 243 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution IVORY COAST over imports and exports of gold, over the soliciting of funds for deposit with foreign private persons and foreign firms and institutions, and over all publicity aimed at placing funds abroad or at subscribing to real estate building operations abroad; these special controls also apply to France, Monaco, and the Operations Account countries. All investments abroad by residents of Ivory Coast require prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Fi- nance. 3 Foreign direct investments in Ivory Coast, 4 must be declared to the Minister of Economy and Finance before they are made. The Minister has a period of two months from receipt of the declaration during which he may request the postponement of the projects submitted to him. The liquida- tion of investments, whether direct investments or not, in Ivory Coast or abroad must similarly be declared in advance to the Minister. Both the making and the liquidation of in- vestments, whether these are Ivory Coast investments abroad or foreign investments in Ivory Coast, must be reported to the Minister within 20 days following each operation. Direct in- vestments are defined as investments implying control of a company or enterprise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 per cent in the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign secu- rities in Ivory Coast requires prior authorization by the Min- ister of Economy and Finance, as do issues by Ivory Coast companies. Exempt from authorization, however, are opera- tions in connection w i th (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Ivory Coast Government and (2) shares similar to securi- ties whose issue, offering, or sale in Ivory Coast has previ- ously been authorized. Borrowing by residents from nonresidents requires prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans cons t i tu t ing a direct investment, which are subject to prior declaration, as indicated above; (2) loans taken up by industrial firms to finance transactions abroad, by any type of firm to finance imports into or exports from Ivory Coast, or by approved international trading houses to finance inter- national merchanting transactions; (3) loans contracted by authorized banks; and (4) loans other than those mentioned above, when the total amount outstanding of these loans, inc lud ing the new borrowing, does not exceed CFAF 50 mil- lion for any one borrower, and provided that the annual interest rate does not exceed the normal market rate. The repayment of loans not constituting a direct investment re- quires the special authorization of the Minister if the loan itself was subject to such approval, but is exempt if the loan was exempt from special authorization. 3 Including those made through the intermediary of foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in Ivory Coast and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Ivory Coast. 4 Inc lud ing those made by companies in Ivory Coast that are directly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in Ivory Coast of foreign companies. 244 Lending abroad is subject to exchange control authoriza- tion. The lending of CFA francs to nonresidents for periods of up to two years, however, is freely permitted. Law No. 59-134 of September 3, 1959 provides tax and customs du ty benefits and other special privileges for new enterprises recognized as having priority status. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Ivory Coast. Imports and exports of gold from or to any other country require prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance, which is rarely granted. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports and exports by the Treasury or the BCEAO; (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles); and (3) imports and exports by travelers of gold articles up to a weight of 250 grams. Both licensed and exempt imports and exports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Changes during 1973 January 29. The commissions levied by the BCEAO on transfers to France and other countries of the French Franc Area except those of the West African Monetary Union were made identical with those on transfers to countries outside the French Franc Area. They were increased on July 2. February 13. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the exchange rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02 was maintained; the effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously CFAF 255.785 = US$1, became CFAF 230.207 = US$1. February 24. Order No. 278 modified the exchange alloca- tions for travel purposes as well as the amounts of BCEAO banknotes that could be imported and exported by travelers. March 19. With the entry into effect of new margins ar- rangements between the French franc and certain other Euro- pean currencies, and the maintenance of the exchange rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02, the CFA franc began to appreciate in terms of the U.S. dollar.

Not for Redistribution JAMAICA Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.900364 gram of f ine gold per Jamaica Dollar. A central rate of J$l = US$1.10 has been established, corresponding to JS1.09668 = SDR 1 or 0.810328 gram of fine gold per Jamaica dollar. The intervention currency is the U.S. dollar and Jamaica avails itself of wider margins. In practice, the Bank of Jamaica's dealings against Jamaica dollars are confined to transactions in U.S. dollars and ster- ling, to purchases of U.S. and Canadian banknotes, and to purchases of certain Caribbean banknotes and coins (see be- low). It deals in other currencies only against U.S. dollars and sterling. The Bank buys and sells U.S. dollars at par, plus a commission of 3/16 of 1 per cent on the selling side. Exchange rates for currencies other than the U.S. dollar (except the Barbados dollar, the East Caribbean dollar, the Guyana dol- lar, and the Trinidad and Tobago dollar) are based on the Bank of Jamaica's buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar and the rates against the U.S. dollar for the currencies con- cerned in international markets. The Bank of Jamaica sets daily official buying and selling rates for dealing with the banks in sterling and Canadian dollars on the basis of the previous day's closing quotations in New York. On the basis of these rates, the Bank also fixes daily rates at which com- mercial banks must deal with their customers in transactions up to J$25,000 involving Jamaica dollars against sterling or Canadian dollars. The Bank of Jamaica is authorized by law to fix its buy ing and selling rates of exchange. On December 31, 1973 these rates relating to spot dealings with the commercial banks reflected no commission charge on purchases but a charge of %6 of 1 per cent on sales. The commercial banks applied a commission charge (premium) of % of 1 per cent on sales of foreign exchange to customers and a commission charge (dis- count) of Yg of 1 per cent on purchases. For purchases equiva- lent to J$ 1,000 or more, the commission charge (discount) was waived. Under an arrangement with the central banks of Barbados, Guyana, and Trinidad and Tobago and with the East Carib- bean Currency Au thor i ty, the Bank of Jamaica purchases banknotes and coins issued by these monetary authorities and repatriates them in return for reciprocity of treatment w i th respect to collections of Jamaica dollars. The Bank's pur- chases are made at the middle rate determined on the basis of the prevailing sterling/U.S. dollar rate; for transactions in these currencies, the commercial banks charge a commission of V4 of 1 per cent either side of the middle rate, buying and selling. There is a "bourse" (interbank exchange market) in which all commercial banks participate and in which only sterling and Canadian dollars are traded against U.S. dollars. Capital transactions between nonresidents and nonbank residents are channeled through an investment currency mar- ket. Transactions are subject on the buying side to a premium of 10 per cent on the Bank of Jamaica's buying rate and on the selling side to a premium of 20 per cent on the Bank of Jamaica's buying rate (plus the normal commission charged on sales of exchange). Jamaica formally accepted the obligations of Article V I I I, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from Febru- ary 22, 1963. Administration of Control The Bank of Jamaica administers exchange control on be- half of the Minister of Finance, subject to certain limitations in respect of which the approval of the Minister is required. The commercial banks are designated as authorized dealers and have authority to provide foreign exchange for imports up to J$ 10,000, and for basic travel allowances and certain other payments up to specified lesser amounts. Import li- censes are issued by the Trade Administrator, who is respon- sible to the Minister of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism. Prescription of Currency Jamaica has ceased to be a Scheduled Territory in terms of the U.K. Exchange Control Act, 1947 but under current U.K. exchange control regulations continues to be regarded as a country of the Overseas Sterling Area. Payments to all countries may be made by crediting Ja- maica dollars to an External Account or in any foreign cur- rency. 1 Receipts from all countries must be received by debit of an External Account or in any foreign currency. Special regulations apply to settlements with Rhodesia, and all pay- ments to Rhodesia require specific authorization. Nonresident Accounts Nonresident accounts in Jamaica dollars may be held by persons who are regarded for exchange control purposes as normally permanently resident outside Jamaica. These ac- counts are fur ther designated External Accounts or Blocked Accounts. The commercial banks are empowered to open External Accounts in Jamaica dollars for nonresidents except residents of Rhodesia, provided that no credit of Jamaica dollars is made to the accounts w i thout the specific approval of the Bank of Jamaica. The funds on these accounts may be trans- ferred freely between nonresidents. External Accounts may be credited with payments by residents of Jamaica approved by the exchange control authorities, with transfers from other External Accounts, and with the proceeds from the sale to an authorized dealer of gold or foreign currencies. They may be debited for payments to residents of Jamaica, for transfers to other External Accounts, and for the purchase of foreign currencies. Accounts which are credited w i th funds that may not be placed at the free disposal of nonresidents of Jamaica (includ- ing the proceeds from the sale of undeveloped land) are desig- nated Blocked Accounts. Blocked funds may be invested in Jamaica dollar securities; the income from such securities is 1 All currencies other than the Jamaica dollar are considered foreign currencies.

Funds originally held on a Blocked Account and the proceeds of Jamaican securities purchased with blocked funds are nor- mally available for credit to an External Account four years after the date of blocking. Applications for the release of funds in Blocked Accounts for use in Jamaica by the nonresi- dent owner must be referred to the Bank of Jamaica. The assets of residents emigrating to countries outside Jamaica in excess of the prescribed settling-in allowance of J$ 10,000 are restricted for a period of four years (see section on Capital, below). Imports and Import Payments Many goods may be imported freely under an open general license.2 Virtually all imports from CARIFTA countries and countries of the Caribbean Common Market are unrestricted. Imports originating in Rhodesia are prohibited and all im- ports originating in the People's Republic of China, the CMEA countries, Cuba, Portugal, or South Africa require individual import licenses. A number of tar iff items or groups of tariff items included in a special schedule of exceptions to the open general license are subject to individual licensing irrespective of country of origin unless (for some of the items in this schedule) the goods originate in and are consigned from other CARIFTA countries (Antigua, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Montserrat, St. Kitts- Nevis-Anguilla, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, or Trinidad and To- bago). The special schedule comprises (1) goods for which specific quotas are assigned to importers according to their past performance, e.g., certain types of footwear, cheese, rice, and various consumer durables (for these items import li- censes are granted by the Trade Administrator against allot- ted quotas); (2) goods which are prohibited, e.g., certain automobiles, radios, television sets, canned milk, cement, ci- gars, citrus products, cheap clothing, household detergents, sugar, and coffee; (3) goods the licensing of which depends upon local supply, e.g., poultry, eggs, and vegetables; and (4) goods licensed to meet the requirements of the tourist indus- try only (including some liquors and sports goods). 3 Payments for imports equivalent to J$ 10,000 or more are subject to prior registration with the Bank of Jamaica and all payments for imports are subject to the licensing require- ments, if any, being met, and the importer presenting a copy of the settlement invoice or other evidence of purchase and value, together with documentary evidence that the goods either have been shipped or are about to be shipped, or that the importer is under contract to make prepayment up to six months prior to shipment; specific exchange control approval 2 The open general license applies to all countries except Albania, Bulgaria, People's Republic of China, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Hun- gary, North Korea, Poland, Portugal (and associated territories), Rhodesia, Romania, South Africa, U.S.S.R., and Nor th Viet-Nam. Goods imported under the license must be consigned from one of the permitted countries and must also originate in a permitted country. (On January 21, 1974 it was announced that the ban on trade with Cuba would be revoked in June 1974.) 3 On January 23, 1974 it was announced that imports of consumer goods in 1974 would be reduced from estimated 1973 levels by J$79 million; certain items were banned, textile quotas were reduced, and imports of automobiles would be limited to J$5 million, subject to a c.i.f. value limit of J$3,000 for each vehicle, and those of commercial vehicles to J$10 million. All existing licenses for motor vehicles were revoked. 246 is required for advance payments preceding shipment by more than six months. Certain goods are subject to a consumption tax, whether they are imported or manufactured domestically. Where such goods are imported, the tax is collected at the port of entry and is calculated on the sum of the value accepted for customs and the customs du ty. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles require the approval of the ex- change control authorities. Except for transactions involving residents of Rhodesia, the following applies. With the excep- tion of payments in respect of foreign travel, bona fide current payments are not restricted. Approval is granted freely for payments for all commercial transactions, when the applica- tion is supported by the appropriate documentary evidence. A basic exchange allocation of JS500 a person for each 12-month period for foreign travel other than for business and professional reasons is made available automatically to residents by the authorized dealers. Additional amounts are granted in cases of hardship. Facilities for travel for business and professional reasons may be provided by authorized banks at the rate of J$60 a day for up to ten days a trip while applications for higher amounts are dealt with by the central bank. Expenses for hotel accommodations, meals en route, etc., that are settled in Jamaica in domestic currency must be deducted from the travel allocations. Authorized dealers may, subject to the presentation of sup- porting evidence, approve payments for the following: re- funds of income tax due to nonresidents; consular fees without limit, as well as transfers from the Ministry of Exter- nal Affairs to accounts in the names of embassies and their established staffs, High Commissioners, and diplomats; up to a limit of J$2,000 for (1) advertising and promotional ex- penses, (2) renewal and refund of premiums due to nonresi- dent insurers, and (3) subscriptions to trade organizations; up to a limit of J$4,000 for commissions and expenses due by Jamaican firms to their agents and representatives and for serial rights in Jamaica of newspaper and magazine articles, photographs, strip cartoons, etc. Requests for additional amounts (except for travel) or for purposes for which there are no standard limits (e.g., remittances by charitable institu- tions) are approved if the authorities are satisfied that no capital flight is involved. 4 Residents going abroad may take with them Jamaica bank- notes not exceeding J$20 and other banknotes not exceeding JS100. Nonresidents may take out the foreign currency notes they brought in. Exports and Export Proceeds All goods valued at not more than JS200 (f.o.b.) for gifts and JS500 (f.o.b.) for other exports may be freely exported by 4 On January 23, 1974 non-Jamaicans working in Jamaica under a work permit no longer were permitted to credit their gross salary to an External Account; henceforth, normally on ly 40 per cent of gross salaries and allowances could be so credited, but existing holders of work permits were not affected. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution post or air express to any country not on the prohibited list. 5 Where the value exceeds these amounts the goods may be exported to all countries except those on the prohibited list, but a specific license is required for the export of certain agricultural products, ammunition, explosives, firearms, an- tique furniture, ready-made garments, gold bullion, mineral and metal ores, and antique paintings. 8 Exporters are re- quired to surrender their exchange proceeds to authorized dealers within six months from the date of sh ipmen t .7 How- ever, certain exporters may retain, w i th the approval of the exchange control authorities, an agreed portion of their pro- ceeds to facilitate the import of items necessary for their operations; such retained export proceeds must not be sold to other nonbank residents. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in foreign currencies must be sold to an authorized dealer. Travelers to Jamaica may bring in Jamaica banknotes up to J$20 a traveler, provided this amount was declared on leaving the country, and any amount of other banknotes; 8 resident travelers are required to sell their holdings of foreign currencies to a local authorized dealer upon return. Capital Outflows of resident-owned capital are restricted, irrespec- tive of their destination. 9 Investments abroad by residents require the approval of the exchange control authorities and are not approved unless they result in tangible benefits for Jamaica. Residents must obtain prior approval from the Bank of Jamaica to make cash gifts, which are normally limited to JS200 in any 12-month period from each donor, to nonresi- dents of Jamaica, 10 Capital transactions between nonresi- dents and nonbank residents are channeled through an investment currency market. With the exception of certain types of investment in real estate, all direct investments in Jamaica by nonresidents are granted "approved status," under which the investor is given written assurance that he will be able to repatriate at any time his original investment plus any capital gain. In order to obtain approved status, the investor must register his invest- ment with the Bank of Jamaica. Repatriation of investments in real estate is not permitted within the period of five years following the sale of the investment if the investor failed to 5 The list comprises Albania, Bulgaria, People's Republic of China, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Hungary, North Korea, Poland, Rhodesia, Romania, South Africa, U.S.S.R., and North Viet-Nam.

JAMAICA make any significant improvements on the land. Remittances of current items, such as profits and dividends, are permitted in fu ll when the application is supported by the appropriate set of accounts. Payments for amortization of, and interest on, foreign loans are permitted upon application to the exchange control authorities. However, nonresidents are not normally permit- ted to take security in respect of loans made to Jamaican companies owned or controlled by them. Domestic bank credit to nonresidents of Jamaica and to nonresident-con- trolled companies is subject to selective credit controls; for this purpose, firms are considered to be nonresident-con- trolled when the controlling interest is held beneficially, ei- ther directly or indirectly, by persons resident outside CARIFTA. Such lending is subject to approval by the Bank of Jamaica; authorized dealers may, however, w i thout reference to the exchange control authorities, make loans or overdrafts to nonresidents of Jamaica up to J$2,000 for certain specified purposes. Authorized dealers may also without reference to the exchange control authorities make loans or overdrafts to resident companies or branches controlled by nonresidents up to J$20,000, provided that the borrower is not specifically precluded under some prior conditional permission from the exchange control authorities. Other requests are referred to the Bank of Jamaica. Repatriates taking up residence in the country of their nationality may transfer all their assets, w i th the exception of capital gains from the sale of undeveloped land; such gains are repatriable at the end of a five-year period from the date of the initial repatriation of the proceeds of the sale of other assets. n Jamaican nationals emigrating are granted a set- tling-in allowance of the equivalent of J$ 10,000 at the official market rate of exchange; any assets in excess of the allowance are restricted for four years. 12 Transfers to beneficiaries resident outside Jamaica under wills and intestacies are approved on the same terms as the 11 On January 23, 1974 the rules for the disposal of the proceeds from the sale of land were revised. Foreign nonresident owners of land who sold it to the Government or to private individuals would receive payment in foreign exchange in ten equal annual installments, except where the owner had received a previous undertaking that the investment in land carried "approved status." The policy of permitting nonresidents working in Jamaica under a work permit to acquire a house to live in was continued, but the transfer of capital gains made from real estate transactions by such persons was restricted on their emigration to J$ 10,000 a year. Foreign sellers of land whose funds were blocked under the new regulations and persons whose funds were restricted under Section 42 of the Exchange Control Law could invest the blocked or restricted funds locally in local registered stocks, and income therefrom could be remitted w i thout l im i t. Foreign nonresident owners of condominiums in Jamaica, when selling these to residents of Jamaica, were allowed to remit from Jamaica in the first instance, the amount they paid originally from funds brought in to Jamaica; the balance of the sale price could be remitted in ten equal installments, subject to a m in imum remittance in any one year of J$ 10,000. Foreign nonresident owners of houses bu i lt on residential lots would be dealt with in the same manner, provided the nonresident seller could satisfy the bank as to the amount spent in Jamaica, in acquiring the lot and constructing the building thereon. The practice of making local mortgage facilities available to nonresident nonnationals in order to assist them to acquire real property in Jamaica would no longer be allowed, except for a nonresident working in Jamaica, in which case the amount that could be borrowed locally would be restricted to 50 per cent of the value of the premises. 12 On January 23, 1974 releases after the four-year restriction period were limited to J$ 100,000 a family un it immediately and J$50,000 annually thereafter. Emigrants in possession of overseas assets at the time of emigration were expected to apply the proceeds thereof to any settling-in allowance to which they were entitled, and thereafter to any remittances from Jamaica. These arrangements were made applicable also to naturalized Jamaican citizens and to nonnationals resident in Jamaica ten years before the enactment of the Work Permit Law. 247 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution JAMAICA transfer of the assets of Jamaican nationals emigrating, pro- vided that all local indebtedness has been met. 13 Gold A J$20 commemorative gold coin issued in 1972 is legal tender but does not circulate. Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Jamaica for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Ministry of Finance; such li- censes are not normally granted except for imports and ex- ports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. All commercial imports of jewelry are pro- hibited. Changes during 1973 During the year a number of import items previously on open general license were made subject to specific import license. The import of some other items was prohibited. January 1. A new customs tariff using the Brussels Tariff Nomenclature came into force. January 16. The Bank of Jamaica ceased to quote fixed rates for the East Caribbean dollar, the Guyana dollar, and the Trinidad and Tobago dollar. January 17. The par value was changed from 1.06641 grams to 0.900364 gram of f ine gold per Jamaica dollar, corresponding to JS0.987013 = SDR 1 or JS0.909991 = US$1 (J$l = US$1.10). Jamaica availed itself of wider mar- gins. The U.S. dollar was designated as the intervention cur- rency. The fixed relationship with sterling, at the ratio of J$l = £ stg. 0.50, was terminated and the Jamaica dollar ceased to float with sterling. January 18.

February 20. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Jamaica established a central rate of J$l = US$1.10, corresponding to 0.810328 gram of fine gold per Jamaica dollar or J$ 1.09668 = SDR 1, and contin- ued to avail itself of wider margins. The effective parity rela- tionship for the U.S. dollar remained unchanged. May 1. The Bank of Jamaica Law, 1960 was amended. Modifications included the following. The provision that the Bank was required to deal in sterling was removed. The spe- cial position of investments in U.K. Government securities was eliminated, the only distinction henceforth made in the law being that between Jamaican Government securities and non-Jamaican Government securities. The Bank was empow- ered to prescribe the maximum amount of working balances that commercial banks may hold in foreign currencies. May 1. The Banking (Amendment) Act, 1973 amended the Banking Law, 1960. Among other things, the minimum capi- tal requirements were increased for both local and foreign banks. A specified minimum amount of the capital of the latter had to be specifically assigned to the financing of their Jamaican operations. May 11. Notice No. 2855 prohibited imports of virtually all footwear. Notice No. 2856 made imports of leather condi- tional on purchases locally or from CARIFTA sources, at a ratio of 1 to 2. June 5. The application of exchange control to the Sterling Area was extended for another six months by a further exten- sion of the Exchange Control (Currency) Order, 1971. On December 5, it was again extended for six months. August 1. The Caribbean Common Market came into ef- fect; Jamaica was one of the four initial members. August 1. The common external tariff of the Caribbean Common Market came into force. August 1. The Jamaica dollar ceased to be legal tender in the Turks and Caicos Islands, where it was replaced by the U.S. dollar. November 1. Commercial banks were required to maintain a minimum of 21 per cent of their deposit liabilities in domes- tic liquid assets. Previously, the minimum liquid assets ratio was 18.5 per cent. 248 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution JAPAN Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.00246853 gram of f ine gold per Japanese Yen, corresponding to Y 360 = SDR 1. A central rate has been established of Y 308.00 = US$1, corresponding to Y 334.4 = SDR 1, and Japan avails itself of wider margins. Since February 14, 1973, however, the authorities have not maintained the exchange rate of the yen w i th in any an- nounced margins, and therefore all spot exchange transac- tions take place at a f luc tua t ing exchange rate. The in te rbank selling rate for the U.S. dollar on December 31, 1973 was about Y 280 per US$1. 1 Authorized banks may freely carry out spot and forward exchange transactions w i th nonresident banks and among themselves; their forward transactions w i th resident customers must have a permitted underlying transac- tion. Japan formally accepted the obligations of Article V I I I, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from April 1, 1964. Administration of Control The exchange control system is operated by the M in is try of Finance, the M in is try of International Trade and Indu s t ry (MITI), and the Bank of Japan as the Government's agent. However, most of the au thor i ty for approving normal pay- ments is delegated to authorized banks referred to as foreign exchange banks. Import and export licensing is handled by MITI. Inward direct investments of a long-term character, unless fu l ly liberalized, require the approval of the Minister of Finance and the competent minister (in some cases that of the Minister of Finance only) af ter deliberation in certain important cases by the Foreign Investment Council. Outward direct investments require the approval of the Minister of Finance in exceptional cases only. Prescription of Currency Payments to all countries may be made in any currency, including yen, and receipts also may be obtained in any cur- rency. Settlements in yen w i th foreign countries must be made through a Nonresident Free Yen Account. All payments to Rhodesia require prior approval by the Minister of Finance or the Minister of In terna t ional Trade and Indus t ry; in many cases such payments are prohibited or restricted for security reasons. Nonresident Accounts There are two main nonresident accounts, as described below. 1. Nonresident Free Yen Accounts. These accounts may be opened by any nonresident w i th any authorized bank in Ja- pan and may be credited w i th the yen proceeds from exports of goods to Japan and from other authorized transactions, with yen proceeds from sales of all foreign currencies, w i th transfers from other Free Yen Accounts, w i th balances out- standing on December 31, 1970 on Nonresident Yen Deposit Accounts (see below), and w i th the countervalue in yen of authorized ou tward payments. There are no restrictions on payments from these accounts, and balances may be con- verted freely in to any foreign currency. Marginal reserve re- quirements are applied against increases in each authorized bank's liabilities on Free Yen Accounts over the average level in a specified base period. 2. Nonresident Yen Deposit Accounts. These accounts may be held by any nonresident with any authorized bank in Japan. They may be credited w i th yen proceeds from transac- tions other than those which are authorized to be credited to Nonresident Free Yen Accounts. Permitted credits to Non- resident Yen Deposit Accounts are limited mainly to pro- ceeds from the sales of debentures and beneficiary certificates sold within six mon ths from the date of validated acquisition. Balances outstanding on December 31, 1970 were permitted to be transferred to Nonresident Free Yen Accounts or to be remitted abroad. Balances accrued after that date are not convertible in to foreign currencies, although remittances are permitted each year up to 30 per cent of the balance at the end of the previous year or the equivalent of Y 720,000, whichever is higher. Withdrawals from these accounts are authorized for certain purposes, such as meeting the outlays involved in managing investments in Japan and the expenses of nonresidents staying in Japan. Transfers to other Nonresi- dent Yen Deposit Accounts may be made freely, thus en- abling the individual account holder to repatriate his funds by selling them to another nonresident in return for foreign cur- rency, but there is no market for such funds in Japan. In addition, there are Foreign Investors' Deposit Accounts in which certain proceeds from investments liquidated by foreigners may be placed. Balances on these accounts may be used for remittances abroad or for making other investments under certain conditions. However, these accounts are of lim- ited importance, because proceeds from foreigners' liquidated investments may be remitted through Nonresident Free Yen Accounts w i thout having been placed in Foreign Investors' Deposit Accounts. Funds remitted to Japan by nonresidents for portfolio investment are channeled through Nonresident Free Yen Accounts, Nonresident Foreign Currencies Deposit Accounts, or Foreign Currencies Securities Special Accounts opened at foreign exchange banks in the name of Japanese securities dealers. Funds in Nonresident Foreign Currencies Deposit Accounts or Foreign Currencies Securities Special Accounts may be channeled through Yen Securities Special Accounts opened at foreign exchange banks in the name of Japanese securities dealers, provided that firm contracts exist for the purchase of specific securities and that the funds will not remain in the account for more than one month. 2 Imports and Import Payments With the exception of books and periodicals, imports from Rhodesia are prohibited. Other imports are subject either to individual licensing by the authorized banks or, if liberalized, 1 On Janua ry 7, 1974 the rate moved to about Y 300 per US$1. 2 This l im i ta t ion was removed w i th effect f rom January 17, 1974. 249 ©International Monetary Fund.

There are two procedures for imports requ ir ing pay- ment in foreign currencies: (1) Under the Import Quota System (covering imports of goods on the "negative list," wh ich comprises 83 items, in terms of the fou r -d ig it Brussels nomenclature; 32 of the 83 items on the "negative list" have been notified to the GATT as residual restrictions while the other 51 items have been no t if ied as f a l l ing under the na t ional security, public health, and moral protection provisions of the GATT), the importer must f irst obtain from MITI an import quota, which is based on the quan t i ta t ive principle. If the quota is granted, the importer receives an import quo ta certif- icate which entitles him to receive an import license from an authorized bank automatically upon application. Practically all import quota certificates are issued on a global basis, w i thout regard to the coun try of origin or the currency of settlement, by MITI. (2) Under the Declaration System, im- ports are free of quan t i ta t ive restriction and licensing and require only a declaration by the importer to a foreign ex- change bank. All items subject to the Declaration System may be imported from any coun try except Rhodesia. Items under state trading include certain dairy products, certain cereals, salt, and raw and manu fac tu red tobacco. Payment for imported goods must be made under one of the "standard" methods of settlement for imports. When the settlement proposal is not in accordance w i th one of the "standard" methods (i.e., when certain advance payment is proposed or payment is to be made more than four mon ths after customs clearance), prior approval of MITI must be obtained. Payments for Invisibles All payments to Rhodesia are subject to the approval of the Minister of Finance or the Minister of In terna t ional Trade and Indus t ry. Payments to other countries for invisibles also require approval, but current payments are not restricted and most such payments are approved freely by foreign exchange banks w i thout any l im i ta t ion or w i th in certain established limits. Payments for certain invisibles, inc lud ing paymen ts that exceed the established limits, are referred to the Bank of Japan for the purpose of capital control; they are automati- cally approved w i thout undue delay, upon verification of the au then t ic i ty of the current transaction. Residents may freely purchase foreign currencies for payments in connection w i th travel abroad up to US$1,000 a person a trip; 3 higher amounts up to US$3,000 4 require validation by a foreign exchange bank, and applications in excess of US$3,000 4 a person a trip require the approval of the Bank of Japan. A traveler is permitted to pay in yen or in foreign currency before departure, the cost of transportation to and f rom his destination and for all side trips.

Settlements which are not made under a "standard" method require, in principle, ind iv idual approval; w i thout such approval, payments for services, etc., may not be made more than three months be- fore, or later than six mon ths after, receipt of the services, etc. Both residents and nonresidents may take out freely Y 100,000 8 in Japanese currency. Subject to verification, i.e., upon presentation of documentation showing any prior con- version of foreign currency, a nonresident may freely pur- chase foreign currencies up to the amount which he brought in to Japan; w i thout verification the conversion in to foreign currencies is l im i ted to the equ iva lent of US$1,000. Exports and Export Proceeds W i th m inor exceptions exports to Rhodesia are prohibited. All exports to Iran, Iraq, and Nigeria require special authori- zation. All exports (except exports w i thout exchange) must be registered w i th a foreign exchange ("bank certification"). Licenses are not generally required, except for goods sub- ject to the following restrictions: restrictions on certain goods to control their export to specified communist countries; re- strictions on goods in short supply in the domestic market (e.g., m inera ls, fertilizers, and staple foods); and restrictions designed to forestall the imposition of import restrictions by other countries (e.g., on sewing machines and certain tex- tiles). Exports under processing and consignment sale con- tracts and exports for which settlement is not under the "standard" method also require ind iv idual licenses. Under the "standard" method of settlement for exports, the value of the exported goods mus t, in general, be settled by d raw ing a bill of exchange payable w i th in five months after sight or w i th in six mon ths af ter sh ipmen t. There are no sur- render requirements for foreign currency earnings. The con- version in to yen of advance receipts in respect of exports, i.e., proceeds received before shipment, requires an individual li- cense when they exceed the equ iva lent of US$10,000.7 Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts under the "standard" method of settlement may be accepted w i thout a license. Under this method, receipts for the value of services, etc., must be obtained w i th in one year before, or w i th in six mon ths a f te r, rendering the service, etc., but contracts for services performed for nonresidents when payment is to be received by a nons tanda rd method are sub- ject to ind iv idual licensing. Receipts from invisibles need not be surrendered. Both residents and nonresidents may bring in freely any amount in foreign or Japanese currency. 6 Reduced to Y 30,000 w i th effect f rom Ap r il 1, 1974. 7 Increased on J a n u a ry 7, 1974 to US$100,000. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Capital* Foreign investments in Japan are generally subject to ap- proval, ma in ly in accordance w i th the Law Concerning For- eign Investment (Law No. 163 of May 10, 1950) or the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law (Law No. 228 of December 1, 1949). All acquisitions of stocks, bonds, debentures, beneficiary certificates, and claims in the form of loans by foreign investors are, in principle, subject to valida- tion or license. However, acquisitions of stocks for po r t fo l io investment and for purposes of management participation are automatically approved by the Bank of Japan or the compe- tent ministers, provided the corporation concerned (except when belonging to one of the 22 nonliberalized indus tr ies mentioned below) consents to foreign participation and pro- vided the limits on foreign ownership that are mentioned below are not exceeded. All these acquisitions must be made against yen proceeds from the sale of foreign exchange or its equivalent, if the investor wishes to obtain remittance rights upon validation. Stocks in the form of stock dividends f rom earned surplus or revaluation of assets may be acquired freely, but application for remittance rights must be made within three mon ths from the date of acquisition. At present, purchases by nonresidents of short-term gov- ernment securities, of unlisted Japanese bonds and deben- tures w i th a m a tu r i ty of one year or less, and of beneficiary certificates of Japanese bond investment trus ts are not nor- mally permitted. The acquisition of Japanese bonds and shares by nonresidents is not restricted, a l though subject in the case of shares to the foreign ownership l im i ts mentioned below. The following are deemed to be the same as yen proceeds from the sale of foreign exchange, if they are reinvested in Japan and if approval had been obtained for their acquisition: proceeds from the redemption after ma tu r i ty of debentures, beneficiary certificates, or claims in the form of loans; divi- dends on stocks, interest on debentures or on claims in the form of loans; distributed profits from beneficiary certificates; receipts from technological assistance contracts; and pro- ceeds from sales of stocks, debentures, and beneficiary certifi- cates. In the event of expropriation or compulsory sale of a fo r- eign investment, the amount paid because of expropriation may be repatriated freely. The remittance of the proceeds from the sale of validated stocks (shares), as well as the transfer abroad of earnings on foreign investments acquired w i th foreign currency, is permit- ted. Proceeds from the sale of validated debentures and bene- ficiary certificates normally may be deposited in Nonresident Free Yen Accounts, if the securities have been held for six months from the date of acquisition. Proceeds f rom the sale of stocks, bonds, debentures, beneficiary certificates, etc., ac- quired with yen w i thd rawn from Nonresident Yen Deposit Accounts may be deposited in Nonresident Free Yen Ac- counts, provided that the securities have been held for at least 'On January 7, 1974 restrictions on impact loans and certain o ther capital inflows (issues of bonds abroad, principally for offshore f inanc ing) were eased.

JAPAN three years from the date of acquisition. Since October 1972 special rules have been in force which provide that the yen proceeds f rom sales of securities by nonresidents must w i th in one mon th of receipt be either reinvested in securities or converted in to fore ign currency for t rans fer abroad. 9 Repayments of loans extended to residents from Nonresi- dent Yen Deposit Accounts become remittable, subject to licensing by the Bank of Japan, beg inn ing three years from the date of the loan. When foreign companies desire to establish a branch or a p lant in Japan, they are required to in fo rm the M in is t ry of Finance and MITI in advance th rough the Bank of Japan. When branches or p lan ts established by foreign companies wish to br ing in f u n ds f rom the ir ma in offices abroad, they are required to obtain licenses. The branches established in accordance w i th approved procedures are permitted to remit their prof i ts and principal abroad. Foreign direct inves tment in Japan generally requires ap- proval by the Minister of Finance and the competent m in is ter (in some cases the approval of the M in is ter of Finance on ly) a f ter deliberation (in certain impo r tant cases) by the Foreign Inves tment Council. Since May 1, 1973, when fu r th er liberal- ization measures for inw a rd direct and por tfo l io inves tment were carried out, the position has been as follows: Foreign ownersh ip up to 100 per cent is permitted in new or existing enterprises in all but 22 industries. Among these 22, foreign ownership in 17 industries, most of which are 50 per cent liberalized, is to be f u l ly liberalized in stages between Decem- ber 1974 and May 1976, f rom which time 100 per cent foreign ownership w i ll be permitted in all but 5 industries. In 4 of these 5 industries, inves tment will be subject to case-by-case screening and in one, foreign ownership will be permitted up to 50 per cent. The present liberalization applies both to the establishment of new f irms and (provided in all cases that the f irm concerned consents) to take-overs of existing f irms or participation in existing firms. Purchases by nonresidents of real estate in Japan for resi- dential or other nonp ro f it purposes and of offices require approval by the Bank of Japan, and those of real estate for other purposes require approval by the M in is t ry of Finance. The approval of the Bank or the M in i s t ry is given au toma t i- cally. The t rans fer abroad of capital by residents and the mak ing of inves tmen ts abroad are subject to approval, but approval generally is either au toma t ic or freely given for ou tward direct inves tmen t, purchases of real estate abroad, and ou tward por tfo l io inves tmen t. However, the acquisition by residents of foreign short-term securities w i th maturities of six mon ths or less is subject to case-by-case screening and at the end of 1973 was not normally permitted. 10 Furthermore, for residents other than ins t i tu t ional investors, there are certain restric- tions on purchases of unlisted securities. Japanese emigrants may remit any amount f rom their assets to any coun try sub- ject only to verification by a foreign exchange bank. Emi- gran ts of foreign na t iona l i ty leaving Japan also may remit to 9 These rules were revoked on J anu a ry 17, 1974. 10 W i th effect f rom J a n u a ry 7, 1974 the acquisition by residents of all foreign shor t- term securities (i.e., w i th ma tu r i t ies of one year or less) became subject to case-by-case screening. 251 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution JAPAN any country any amount of personal assets, subject to verifi- cation by a foreign exchange bank. Certain types of outflows of long-term capital are facilitated by a foreign currency lend- ing system under which government institutions and foreign exchange banks are authorized to make foreign currency loans to residents for up to 90 per c e n tll of their direct investment operations abroad and for advance payments in respect of imports. Outward financial credits and loans are subject to licensing. The issuing of bonds abroad, including issues for conversion in to yen for domestic use, also is subject to licensing; at the end of 1973 such issues were being permit- ted selectively. Securities acquired w i th approval under the Law Concern- ing Foreign Investment may be imported and exported freely. Foreign exchange banks are subject to controls over their overall net position in foreign currency (spot and forward combined). The switching of foreign funds in to yen by foreign exchange banks is also subject to regulation; their interoffice liabilities on Nonresident Free Yen Accounts are regarded as foreign exchange liabilities for the application of this regula- tion. These banks are also subject to marginal reserve require- ments against increases in their liabilities on Nonresident Free Yen Accounts. The interest rates on such accounts and on nonresident-owned foreign currency accounts must not exceed those on resident-owned deposits, but otherwise are not subject to control. Gold Residents, including domestic producers of gold, may freely hold gold and purchase and sell it in domestic transac- tions. The import of gold bullion containing more than 45 per cent gold in weight normally is permitted, provided a pay- ments license is obtained from the Bank of Japan; the volume of gold bullion imports may, however, be restricted at the discretion of the authorities if it reaches a level that would result in a disruptive influence on international gold markets. Imports of other gold bullion, gold coins, and most articles of gold are freely permitted, subject only to verification by a foreign exchange bank. Travelers (resident or nonresident) are freely permitted to bring in up to one kilogram of gold bullion a person a trip and up to the equivalent of US$1,000 in articles of gold and gold coins. 12 Gold bullion, gold coins, and gold articles acquired by donation or inheritance may be imported freely, subject only to verification by the customs authorities. Exports of gold bullion, gold coins, and articles of gold by residents require licenses from the M in is try of Finance; exports of gold bullion are not normally permitted. Changes during 1973 January 7. Controls on exports to specified countries were eliminated for 5 commodities and relaxed for 54 other com- modities. These countries were Albania, Bulgaria, the Peo- ple's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Hungary, North Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, the U.S.S.R., and North Viet-Nam. 11 Reduced to 50 per cent w i th effect from Janua ry 7, 1974. 12 Reduced to US$200 w i th effect f rom April 1, 1974. 252 January I. Export control measures were imposed under the Export Control Ordinance and the Export-Import Trans- action Law, as part of the Third Yen Defense Program; they applied to 20 major export commodities. January 16. The prior licensing system applicable to im- ports from countries with which no diplomatic relations were maintained was relaxed in respect of the People's Republic of China. January 30. A Ministry of Finance ordinance was issued describing, for registration statement purposes, the disclosure requirements applicable to foreign private enterprises, thus facilitating public offerings in Japan by foreign corporate issuers. In May, the Ministry of Finance and the Tokyo Stock Exchange announced that they accepted in principle the lis- t ing of foreign stocks on the Exchange by mid-July; applica- tions for listing would be accepted if financial statements were presented on a nonconsolidated basis (i.e., giving data for the parent company only). February 5. The "leeway" provision for nonresidents1 pur- chases of domestic equities was revoked and the use of the "swing system" for such transactions became subject to ap- proval by the Ministry of Finance. February 14. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the Japanese Government decided to allow the Japanese yen to float in the market; with effect from February 14, the market rate of the yen would not necessarily be confined w i th in the margins hitherto observed. The U.S. dollar opened at about Y 271.20. Previously, ex- change rates for the U.S. dollar were based on the central rate of Y 308 = US$1, w i th official limits of Y 314.93 and Y 301.07, per US$1. February 26. The Foreign Exchange Fund Special Ac- count resumed deposits of foreign currency with foreign ex- change banks for forward cover for the exports of small and medium-size enterprises. April 1. Import duties were reduced on 105 commodities. April 1. Japan's scheme of generalized preferences for de- veloping countries was expanded as to country coverage and commodity coverage, and some of the preferential duties were reduced. The scheme was also fu r ther liberalized administra- tively. April 1. The prohibition on private imports of industrial gold (bars and ingots) and of gold coins was lifted. Further- more, resident travelers were freely permitted to bring in up to one kilogram of industrial gold a person a trip. At the same time, it was announced that imports of articles of gold would be liberalized on Ju ly 1, 1973. (The volume of bullion imports could be limited at the discretion of the authorities if it reached a level that exerted a disruptive effect on interna- tional gold markets.) April 13. The remaining import quotas were increased ei- ther by 30 per cent over the levels in the fiscal year 1972 or to 8 per cent of domestic consumption, whichever was larger. April 19. Imports of certain commodities, including digital electronic calculating machines, were liberalized. The number of residual restrictions notified to the GATT was reduced from 33 to 32. May 1.

Not for Redistribution form of foreign currency was raised from 70 per cent to 90 per cent and the use of these loans, which previously was limited ma in ly to outward direct investment, was permitted also for real estate purchases abroad and for advance pay- ments in respect of any type of imports. May 1. The restrictions on the acquisition by nonresidents of Japanese shares in individual companies were relaxed. The new measure eliminated the restrictions on the acquisition of stocks for portfolio investment (as well as those on the acqui- sition of stocks for participation in management), provided that the company concerned consented to foreign participa- tion (and except in the 22 industries to which the liberaliza- tion of inward direct investment was not immediately applicable). Previously, the acquisition on a portfolio basis was permitted only where the combined foreign ownership of a company's shares remained below 25 per cent (or in some cases up to 15 per cent, depending on the type of indus try) and where an individual foreign investor's holdings remained below 10 per cent of the company's share capital; the same 25 per cent and 10 per cent limits previously determined the point beyond which the acquisition of stocks for participation in the management of existing companies was subject to indi- vidual screening by the competent ministries. May 1. Further liberalization measures for inward direct investment were taken. These implied that in and after 1976 virtually all industries would be fu l ly open to foreign owner- ship (provided, in all cases, that the enterprise concerned consented to the investment); most of the industries affected were 50 per cent liberalized prior to May, and the earlier liberalization measures normally were applicable only to the establishment of new firms, not to take-overs or participa- tions in existing firms. As a result of the new measures, the number of nonliberalized industries was reduced to five: pri- mary indus t ry related to agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; the mining indus try (liberalized up to 50 per cent, as before); the oil industry; the leather products manufac tur ing indus t ry; and retailing (liberalized up to 50 per cent, as before, for operations not exceeding 11 stores). For another 17 industries full liberalization was postponed for periods to be determined later but not exceeding three years. All other industries were liberalized, w i th foreign ownership permissible up to 100 per cent. July 1. Impor ts of manufactured articles of gold (jewelry in the form of watch bands, bracelets, brooches, etc., fa l l ing within tariff headings 71.12 and 71.13) were liberalized. It was announced that imports of gold necklaces would remain controlled un t il April 1, 1974. July 17. The basic rules regarding the listing of foreign shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange were announced; they were to become effective on November 6. August 31. The export control measures that had entered into force on January 1 as part of the Third Yen Defense Program were allowed to lapse. Septembers. Forward trading on the Tokyo exchange mar- ket switched to the fixed-date delivery system, for interbank transactions only. Previously, the calendar mon th system was used, under which forward exchange could be delivered on any business day w i th in a calendar month, at the buyer's option. JAPAN September 4. The Foreign Ministry announced that it would henceforth accept consolidated financial statements for the listing of foreign shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, provided that consolidation was in accordance with the laws and traditional practices of the countries in which the compa- nies are based. The criteria for listing, which had been pub- lished on July 17, came into effect on November 6. November 1. Imports of a number of foodstuffs were liber- alized. November 1. The August 1972 regulation was relaxed un- der which foreign issuers of yen-denominated bonds (and other foreign borrowers of yen) had been required to remit 90 per cent of the proceeds immediately after the issue and the remaining 10 per cent no later than one year from the date of issue. November 6. The prohibition on the net acquisition of Ja- panese stocks by nonresidents was terminated. The acquisi- tion of Japanese bonds and shares by nonresidents no longer was required to take place through securities dealers or for- eign exchange banks. November 13. The acquisition by residents of foreign short-term securities (with maturities not exceeding six months), including treasury bills and similar government pa- per, was made subject to case-by-case approval and in effect prohibited. November 13. The Bank of Japan announced that, with effect from November 21, it would not allow the total amount of its yen loans to foreign exchange banks under the import financing scheme to rise beyond the level outstanding on November 20. November 13. The Bank of Japan declared yen-denomi- nated import usance bills eligible as collateral for advances by the Bank and announced that such bills would be used as instruments of the Bank's open market operations. November 15. The six-month ceiling on the maturity of forward exchange purchase or sales contracts concluded by nonresidents with foreign exchange banks was lifted, placing nonresidents and residents on an equal basis. Furthermore, residents were permitted to use their foreign exchange depos- its held in Japan for executing their forward contracts. November 15. The "foreign currency to yen conversion re- striction" was eased. The acquisition by nonresidents of bal- ances in Free Yen Accounts was facilitated for certain types of transactions; these included the servicing of intergovern- mental yen loans (principal and interest) and deposits by nonresident importers related to yen-denominated exports of Japanese capital goods. November 15. The controls prohibiting Japanese ex- port-tied guarantees by head offices of Japanese firms to their overseas branches or affiliates were relaxed. November 24. The amount (for each export transaction) beyond which the conversion into yen of export proceeds received before shipment required an individual license was raised from US$5,000 to US$10,000. November 24. The restrictions introduced on October 23, 1972 on the chartering by residents of ships and aircraft exported from Japan were removed; approval for the charter- ing of ships and aircraft exported from Japan ceased to be required. 253 ©International Monetary Fund.

The Bank of Japan decided that it would gradually reduce the outstanding balances of its loans under the import f inanc ing scheme to foreign exchange banks. December 17. Foreign exchange banks and their overseas branches were permitted to resume lending to foreign import- ers of Japanese goods. December 17. The amount up to which residents could freely and at any time make payments abroad was reduced from US$3,000 to US$1,000 for each remittance. December 17. The supervision over the use of foreign ex- change for tourist travel was tightened. An automatic alloca- tion was set of US$1,000 a person a trip. Applications for amounts between US$1,000 and US$3,000 required valida- tion by a foreign exchange bank and those for amoun ts in excess of US$3,000 required approval by the Bank of Japan. December 17. The "foreign currency to yen conversion restriction" was eased fu r the r. Nonresident Free Yen Ac- counts were exempted from the yen conversion controls, w i th the exception of interoffice accounts. Except in respect of "intrabank free yen," the directive was w i thd rawn which had prescribed that each foreign exchange bank must main- tain on its books foreign currency assets that could not be less than the total of its Nonresident Free Yen balances.

Not for Redistribution Exchange Rate System Nonresident Accounts JORDAN The par value is 2.29184 grams of f ine gold per Jordan Dinar, corresponding to JD 0.387754 = SDR 1 or JD 1 = US$3.1111, and Jordan avails itself of wider margins. The Central Bank's official limits for the U.S. dollar are US$3.1811 buy ing, and US$3.0303 selling, per JD 1 and commercial banks deal w i th the public w i th in these limits. On December 31, 1973, the Central Bank's buy ing and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were US$3.0488 and US$3.0303 per dinar, and those for sterling were £ stg. 1.3101 and £ stg. 1.3004 per dinar. l The same buy ing and selling rates were also quoted by the commercial banks. Authorized banks deal in currencies other than U.S. dollars at rates usually based on the rates in the London and New York markets. A fee of 4 per cent is levied on the issue of import licenses. A fee of yio of 1 per cent is levied on exchange permits approved by the Central Bank for sales of exchange for imports, except imports of government departments and certain other ap- proved institutions. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Foreign Relations Department of the Central Bank of Jordan, which also issues exchange licenses; the Central Bank has, however, delegated to authorized banks the issuance of exchange licenses up to a permitted annual limit for payments for educational ex- penses of Jordanians s tudy ing abroad. An Import Committee comprising representatives of the Ministries of National Economy and Finance and Customs and the Central Bank presents from time to time suggestions and recommendations concerning changes in import policy to the Minister of Na- tional Economy. In addition, an Economic Security Commit- tee is empowered to amend existing regulations or issue new ones concerning any aspect of Jordan's economic policies when th is is considered necessary to the national interest. Prescription of Currency Jordan has ceased to be a Scheduled Territory in terms of the U.K. Exchange Control Act, 1947 but under current U.K. exchange control regulations continues to be regarded as a country of the Overseas Sterling Area. All settlements with Egypt, except those for Egyptian rice exports (paid for in U.S. dollars outside the clearing arrangements) must be made in pounds sterling through clearing accounts under the bilateral payments agreement with that coun try. Payments to other countries may be made in any currency. Proceeds from exports and invisibles must be collected, and surrendered where required, in any convertible currency through an authorized bank in Jordan or in Jordan dinars from a nonresident account with an authorized bank in Jor- dan. 1 In addition to U.S. dollars and pounds sterling, the Central Bank ma in ta ins official quotations for deutsche ma rk, French francs, I ta l ian lire, and Swiss francs. Subject to the prior approval of the Central Bank of Jor- dan, authorized banks may open nonresident accounts in domestic currency. These accounts must be fed w i th appro- priate funds; the approval of the Central Bank is necessary for transfers f rom resident to nonresident accounts, but transfers between nonresident accounts are permitted free ly. In addi- tion, nonresidents, inc lud ing Jordanians wo rk ing abroad, may freely open foreign currency accounts w i th authorized dealers; balances may be w i thd rawn freely in convertible cur- rency. Imports and Import Payments Imports of certain items 2 from any source, some imports from Romania, and all impo r ts from Israel and Rhodesia are prohibited. All other impor ts, unless covered by an agree- ment between Jordan and the expor t ing coun t ry (i.e., agricul- tural products from neighboring countries), require import licenses if their c.& f. value is JD 50 or more. These are granted freely by the M in i s t ry of National Economy, except for certain items 3 which are subject to scru t iny by the Minis- ter of National Economy (whose prior approval is also re- quired for imports of indus tr ial mach inery and of all materials needed for the establishment or expansion of an industrial firm) or scrutiny by the competent ministry. Im- porters of tea must meet 80 per cent of the ir requirements, and those of cast iron or steel tubes 50 per cent of their requirements, from Ind ian sources. Import licenses are gener- a l ly valid for 12 mon ths. The importer must complete the process of impor ta t ion w i th in the period of va l id i ty of the license. Imports should, in principle, enter the coun try th rough the port of Aqaba; goods that do not meet this requirement are subject to a penalty of 20 per cent of the c.i.f. value (10 per cent for foods tuffs; Pharmaceuticals are exempt). The Import Committee may grant exemptions from these rules on a case-by-case basis upon application. Bank guarantees in favor of the M in is try of Finance and Customs are required on most imports shipped th rough ports other than Aqaba. Impor ts that require an import license also require an ex- change license from the Central Bank; authorized dealers, however, have au tho r i ty to approve the opening of a letter of credit. Exchange licenses are granted automatically when an import license has been obtained; the importer holding an exchange license may either open a letter of credit or pay against documents. A fee of V10 of 1 per cent is levied on exchange licenses for imports, except those made by govern- ment departments and certain approved institutions. Most 2 These inc lude carbonic acid; arak; alcohol; nonalcoholic beverages; diesel-engmed cars, trucks, and buses; and m i l i t a ry un i fo rms. Certain of these commodities may be imported, however, from Arab Common Market countries and f rom countries w i th wh ich trade agreements are in force.

Payments for Invisibles Capital Remittances by postal order do not require exchange con- trol approval, provided that they do not exceed JD 10 a person a mon th. With this exception, all payments for invisi- bles are subject to exchange control approval. Payments for the fo l low ing types of invisibles are generally permitted up to certain limits: income of nonresidents; savings of foreign na- tionals who intend to return to their own countries; remit- tances to refugee dependents; reasonable l iv ing expenses of Jordanian nationals abroad; expenses of Jordanian residents traveling abroad; expenses for education; expenses for medi- cal treatment; business expenses abroad; and insurance pay- men ts in accordance w i th special regulations. The exchange allowance for travel to Arab countries, Cyprus, and Turkey is the equivalent of JD 100 a person a trip, and that for travel to other countries is the equivalent of JD 16 a person a day for business travel and JD 12 a person a day for other travel (half of these amoun ts for children under 15) for trips of up to 30 days; each person may annua l ly make three business trips and two tourist trips. For fam i ly support, an annual allowance of between JD 600 and JD 1,200 for each donor is permitted; however, remittances by postal order may be made at a rate not exceeding JD 10 a mon th to any one person resident abroad and are not subject to the ceiling of JD 600-1,200. The policy in respect of payments for invisibles is, in general, liberal and nondiscriminatory. Residents traveling abroad may take out up to JD 100 in any combination of Jordanian and foreign notes and coins. Furthermore, all travelers may take out checks, travelers checks, or letters of credit issued by authorized banks in Jordan in accordance w i th exchange permits authorized by the Central Bank. Tourists and other nonresidents may also take out foreign currency notes and coins and any other foreign means of payment that they had previously brought in and declared upon en t ry. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Israel and Rhodesia are prohibited. Export pro- ceeds exceeding JD 50 must be collected and the foreign exchange surrendered w ih in three mon ths of shipment. Ex- empt are the proceeds from perishable vegetables and f ru i ts. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange receipts from invisibles must be surren- dered to an authorized bank or, if banknotes are received, to an authorized exchange dealer. Travelers entering Jordan may bring in any amount in Jordanian and foreign notes and coins. 4 Any person regarded for exchange control purposes 4 No approval is given for the cred i t ing of such Jordanian cu r rency to a nonresident account or for the rem i t tance abroad of the equivalent in foreign cu r rency. 256 Capital may be imported freely, but exports of capital re- quire approval and normally are not allowed. Current income resulting from nonresident investments in Jordan may be transferred abroad. Under the Law for the Encouragement of Investment, effective October 16, 1972, profits from approved foreign investments may be remitted, without limitation, in the currency of the original investment or any other convert- ible currency approved by the Central Bank. After two years repatriation of the capital is permitted in three equal annual installments in the same foreign currency in which the origi- nal investment was made. The Investment Committee may approve more liberal provisions. All transactions under the investment law require the prior approval of the Central Bank. Gold Residents may purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in Jor- dan for numismatic or investment purposes. With this excep- tion, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Licenses for imports of gold in any form other than jewelry are issued by the M in is try of National Economy on the rec- ommendation of the Central Bank, while exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require a license from the Central Bank. Licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. The Central Bank has issued four gold coins under the Gold and Silver Coins Regulation No. 61 of 1968; these coins, although legal tender, do not circulate and are available on ly to nonresidents and domestic numismatists. Changes during 1973 January 1. Jordanian citizens henceforth were allowed to visit their relatives in the West Bank only once every two years. They could not take out more than JD 50 in domestic currency on such trips. February 17. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Jordan maintained its par value in terms of gold. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously JD 1 = US$2.80, became JD 1 = US$3.1111. Jordan continued to avail itself of wider margins. The Central Bank quoted new official buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar of US$3.1056 and US$3.0864, respectively, per JD 1. March 21. The Aqaba surcharge was reduced to 10 per cent for imports of certain foodstuffs, including frozen beef and fresh or frozen fish. April 10. The surrender requirements for export proceeds were tightened. The proceeds from all goods other than per- ishable vegetables and fruits normally had to be offered for sale to an authorized dealer within three months of shipment. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Previously, exports of many commodities to Arab League countries and Iran were exempt from surrender. April 11. Nonresidents, including Jordanians wo rk ing abroad, were permitted to open foreign currency accounts with authorized dealers. Interest rates on such accounts would be kept in line w i th those in major money marke ts abroad and the interest was exempt from tax. May 1. The Central Bank delegated to authorized dealers the au tho r i ty to approve applications for the opening of im- port letters of credit. October 31. The reduction of the Aqaba surcharge to 10 per cent was extended to all foodstuffs. JORDAN 257 ©International Monetary Fund.

A central rate of K Sh 6.90000 = US$1 has been established and Kenya avails itself of wider margins. 1 The Central Bank of Kenya deals w i th the Government and w i th authorized banks in Tanzania shillings and Uganda shillings against Kenya shil- lings at par; the authorized banks also deal w i th the public in these currencies at p a r .2 In transactions w i th authorized banks, the Central Bank of Kenya stands ready to issue Ke- nya shillings in exchange for U.S. dollars and to supp ly U.S. dollars in exchange for Kenya shillings; its buy ing and selling rates are K Sh 6.8978 and K Sh 6.9044 per US$1. The Central Bank deals w i th the Government in pounds sterling on the basis of the daily opening rates for sterling in New York. The Central Bank does not deal in foreign currencies 3 other than sterling, U.S. dollars, and deutsche ma rk, except occasionally on behalf of the Government. Banks in Kenya base their rates for such foreign currencies on the previous day's closing rates in New York. The Central Bank deals forward in sterling and U.S. dollars w i th commercial banks, to cover their contracts w i th exporters only; traders' forward exchange contracts re- qu ire Central Bank approval when they exceed three mon ths. Administration of Control The Minister of Finance and Economic P lann ing has dele- gated the administration of exchange control to the Central Bank of Kenya. Au tho r i ty for approving payments for im- ports with an invoiced value of less than K Sh 2,000, many payments in respect of current invisibles, and some capital payments to countries other than Tanzania and Uganda is delegated to the authorized banks. Import and export controls are administered by the Direc- tor of Trade and Supplies in the M in is t ry of Commerce and Indus t ry. The responsibility for issuing import and export licenses rests w i th the Director, to whom applications should be submitted by the importer and exporter in Kenya before orders are placed abroad or exports are shipped. Applications for foreign exchange allocation permits for imports also must be submitted to the Director of Trade and Supplies, who forwards these to the Central Bank. Orders for impo r ts of goods on open general license must be preregistered w i th the Central Bank before shipment. The government-owned Ke- nya National Trading Corporation, Ltd., has a monopoly over the import of specified commodities and the export of certain agricultural commodities is controlled by State Mar- keting Boards. 1 W i th effect from Janua ry 14, 1974 Kenya established a cen tral ra te of K Sh 7.14286 = US$1, equ iva lent to 0.103133 gram of f ine gold per Kenya sh i l l ing and corresponding to K Sh 8.61675 = SDR 1. Kenya con t inued to avail itself of wider margins. The relationship to the Tanzania sh i l l ing and the Uganda sh i l l ing remained unchanged. New buy ing and selling rates for the U.S. do l lar were set at K Sh 7.1407 and K Sh 7.1471, respectively, per US$1. 2 All dealings in Tanzania and Uganda banknotes are suspended. 3 All currencies other than the Kenya sh i l l ing, the Tanzania sh i l l ing, the Uganda sh i l l ing, and the East African sh i l l ing are considered foreign currencies. 258 Together w i th Tanzania and Uganda, Kenya is part of the East Afr ican currency area. Payments from Kenya to Tanza- nia and Uganda are free of restrictions, but the export or import of Kenya banknotes is prohibited. Prescription of Currency Kenya has ceased to be a Scheduled Territory in terms of the U .K. Exchange Control Act, 1947 but under current U .K. exchange control regulations continues to be regarded as a coun t ry of the Overseas Sterling Area. Settlements w i th Tanzania and Uganda normally are effected in East African cu r r en cy .4 Payments to residents of countries other than Tanzania and Uganda (except Rhodesia and South Africa) may be made in sterling to an External Account in the United Kingdom, in Kenya shillings to the credit of an External Account in Kenya, or in any other foreign currency except Rhodesian currency. Receipts from countries other than Tan- zania, Uganda, and Rhodesia may be obtained in sterling from an External Account in the United Kingdom, in Kenya shillings from an External Account in Kenya, or in any other foreign currency designated as a specified cu r r en cy .5 Special regulations apply to settlements w i th Rhodesia; all payments and transfers to Rhodesia are prohibited. Remittances to South Africa also are prohibited, w i th the exception of those of pensions payable by the Government of Kenya or by the East African Commun i ty organizations. Nonresident Accounts Accounts in Kenya sh i l l ings held by residents of countries other than Tanzania, Uganda, or Rhodesia w i th authorized banks in Kenya are, w i th exchange control approval, desig- nated External Accounts. They may be credited freely with authorized payments to such countries by residents of Kenya, w i th transfers f rom other External Accounts, and w i th the proceeds f rom sales of any currency (other than East African or Rhodesian currency) and gold by nonresidents to autho- rized dealers. External Accounts may be debited freely for paymen ts to residents and nonresidents. Non transferab le funds of residents of countries other than Tanzania and Uganda are credited to Blocked Accounts. Sub- ject to prescribed procedures, balances on Blocked Accounts (other than those in the beneficial ownership of residents of South Africa or Rhodesia) may be used for approved domes- tic expenditures and for the purchase in Kenya of specified bonds issued by the Kenyan Government or by local authori- ties and officially quoted in Kenya; 6 the redemption proceeds of these securities, wh ich must have a l ife of f ive years at the 4 East Afr ican cu r rency comprises Kenya sh i l l ings, Tanzania shillings, and Uganda sh i l l ings. 5 Aus tr ian schillings, Belgian f rancs, Canadian dollars, Danish and Faroese kroner, deutsche m a r k, French francs, I t a l i an lire, Japanese yen, Ne the r lands guilders, Norwegian k rone r, Portuguese escudos, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, U.S. dollars, and all S te r l ing Area currencies other than the Kenya sh i l l ing, the Tanzania sh i l l ing, the Uganda sh i l l ing, and the East A f r ican sh i l l ing. 6 Such securities mu st be payab le in East African cu r rency and they must not be redeemable earlier t h an f i ve years f rom the da te of acqu is i t ion. ©International Monetary Fund.

Imports and Import Payments Some imports from all sources are prohibited for reasons of public policy; imports of certain other goods are not being licensed. All imports from metropolitan Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. W i th certain exceptions, imports from Tanzania and Uganda are unrestricted, but many goods imported from these countries require a specific license unless they are of Tanzanian or Ugandan origin. Many goods may be freely imported from other sources under open general license, but others require a specific license. A number of commodities may be imported only by or to the order of the Kenya National Trading Corporation, Ltd. With minor exceptions, all private sector imports of com- modities in Schedules I, II, I I I, and IV from countries other than Tanzania and Uganda require a foreign exchange alloca- tion license issued by the Central Bank when the ir invoice value exceeds K Sh 2,000; applications must be subm i t ted before firm orders are placed. Impor ts of goods on open general license do not require an exchange allocation license but must be preregistered w i th the Central Bank before f i rm orders are placed. In addition to the open general import license, there are four commodity schedules for imports. All goods in the f i r st three schedules require a specific import license f rom the Director of Trade and Supplies. Once the specific import license has been obtained, foreign exchange is granted free ly for goods in Schedule I and on the basis of quotas reflecting past imports for goods in Schedule II. No foreign exchange is granted for Schedule III items. For the only item in Sched- ule IV, passenger motor vehicles other than buses and special vehicles, a specific import license is not required but foreign exchange is allocated on a quota basis. When an exchange allocation license has been obtained from the Central Bank or when such a license is not required, authorized banks provide exchange automatically. Prior ex- change control approval must be obtained for imports of capital goods on deferred payment terms, and for imports of machinery and equipment when the value is required to be regarded as a contribution toward capital or to be accounted for on a loan basis. Most imports w i th a pro forma invoice value in excess of K Sh 20,000 are also subject to preshipment inspection as to qua l i ty, qu an t i ty, and price by the General Superintendence Company acting for the Central Bank of Kenya. A "Clean Report of Findings" must be obtained before shipment, and authorized banks in Kenya may not issue shipping guarantees for the clearance of imports un t il this "Clean Report" has been received. The buy ing and conf irm ing commission w i th respect to imports in to Kenya may not exceed 3 per cent of the value of the import. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to all countries other than Tanzania and Uganda are controlled. Authorized banks are empow- KENYA ered to approve specified categories of current payments w i thout l im i ta t ion or up to established limits; amounts above these limits as well as other cu r rent paymen ts may be ap- proved adm in is tra t ive ly, and most current payments are in fact unrestricted. Fees for education up to the equivalent of K Sh 14,000 a person for a fu ll scholastic year and fees for other specified purposes may be approved by an authorized bank upon pro- duction of evidence of debt. Facilities exist whereby nationals of countries other than Tanzania and Uganda who come to work in Kenya as employed persons (as well as certain cate- gories of the self-employed, such as doctors and dentists) for not more than four years may remit abroad as savings up to 33 Y3 per cent of their m o n t h ly salaries but not more than K Sh 3,000 a mon th; in add i t ion, they may remit funds to cover fam i ly maintenance, education expenses, etc., provided that the ir total remittances inc lud ing savings do not exceed 50 per cent of their m o n t h ly salaries. Expatriates who have stayed for over four years in the Scheduled Territories 7 may con t inue to effect remittances from salaries as above, but those who avail themselves of the facilities for remittance of savings from salaries are not entitled to exchange facilities upon em igra t ion. Remittances to South Africa, other than those of certain pensions, are prohibited. Nonresident individual p rope r ty owners may remit up to K Sh 20,000 of net rental income in each 12-month period. Any excess of net rent over the permitted transfer is placed in a Blocked Account and may be invested in approved secu- rities w i th at least f ive years to m a tu r i ty, af ter which period the sale proceeds may be remitted to the nonresident benefi- ciary. Real estate companies deriving income solely from rent are permitted to t ran s fer annu a l ly up to 10 per cent of the book value of the ir properties as at September 25, 1970. Where income is derived from rent as well as other sources, the exchange control authorities must approve the remittance of such incomes. The basic allowance for travel outside the Scheduled Terri- tories by adu l ts holding round - t r ip tickets is K Sh 4,000 a person (K Sh 2,000 for children between 3 and 12 years of age) every two years, wh ich may be taken out in foreign banknotes. 8 Holders of one-way tickets are entitled to a basic travel allowance of K Sh 2,000 for adu l ts and K Sh 1,000 for children. The basic allowance is not available for travel to Rhodesia or South Africa. Nonresident travelers may take out foreign currency notes up to the amount they brought in upon en t ry. Residents of Kenya traveling abroad on in ter- national f l igh ts and ho ld ing return tickets may carry up to K Sh 100 w i th them for local expenses on re turn, but other- wise the export of Kenya banknotes is prohibited. 7 Kenya's exchange con trol regu la t ions define the Scheduled Territories as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. 8 Banks are not perm i t ted, w i t h o ut specific approval, to sell exchange in excess of K Sh 200 a day (subject to a max imum of K Sh 3,000 for a stay of not less than 15 days) for t ravel to Bu rund i, Ethiopia, Ma law i, Mozambique, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, Zaire, and Zambia. 259 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution KENYA Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of certain foods tuffs and agricultural products re- quire licenses and may be subject to restriction in order to ensure sufficient supplies for consumption in Kenya. Exports of tea, certain minerals, precious stones, and strategic materi- als are also subject to licensing. Export licenses for some commodities are required only for destinations other than Tanzania or Uganda. Other goods may be exported without licenses. Exports of coffee are made through the intermediary of the Coffee Marketing Board. All exports to metropolitan Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. Export proceeds in foreign currencies must be collected w i th in six months of exportation and offered to an authorized bank in Kenya for conversion into Kenya shillings. 9 Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in specified currencies (see foot- note 5) must be sold to an authorized bank. Travelers may bring in freely foreign currency notes, with the exception that the import of Tanzania or Uganda shilling notes is not per- mitted. The import of domestic banknotes is prohibited, w i th the exception that residents returning to Kenya on an interna- tional flight may bring in up to K Sh 100 previously taken out by themselves. The import of East African shilling notes also is prohibited. Capital Capital transfers to all countries other than Tanzania and Uganda are restricted. Transfers to Rhodesia or South Africa are not allowed. With the exception of expatriate employees who have opted for remittance of savings from salaries, per- sons leaving Kenya permanently may transfer their assets up to the equivalent of K Sh 50,000 for each fam i ly un it if they take up residence in a country outside the Scheduled Territo- ries; they may additionally every 12 months thereafter, during a period of five years, apply for the release of K Sh 20,000 from their Blocked Accounts. All remaining funds must be credited to a Blocked Account; they may then be invested in approved Scheduled Territory securities, and redemption proceeds become transferable, provided that redemption does not take place earlier than five years from the date of pur- chase. There is no restriction on the investment of foreign funds in Kenya, but to ensure eventual repatriation it is necessary to obtain from the Treasury a "certificate of approved enter- prise" for the investment. Foreign and domestic investment in specified types of production requires approval under the East African Licensing Ordinance. Local borrowing by non- resident-owned or nonresident-controlled companies requires exchange control approval and is restricted. Except in respect of Tanzania and Uganda, all imports and exports of securities require approval. Approval is freely granted for the purchase by nonresidents of Kenyan securities on a recognized stock exchange, provided that payment is received in an appropriate manner. The income from such 9 There are m inor exemptions w i th respect to Ethiopian dollars and Somali shillings for persons resident in specified border areas. 260 securities is remittable, but the proceeds on resale must nor- mally be credited to a Blocked Account. Purchases of securi- ties outside Tanzania and Uganda by residents are not normally permitted. A resident of Kenya may not send as a cash gift to a country other than Tanzania or Uganda more than K Sh 200 a year w i thout specific exchange control ap- proval. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Kenya for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial and professional users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Exports of gold in any form other than jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler require exchange control approval. The import of the following from all sources other than Tanzania and Uganda, and from Tanzania and Uganda when originat- ing in other countries is subject to individual licensing: jew- elry of gold, silver, or platinum; goldsmiths' or silver- smiths' wares, inc lud ing set gems; bullion in the ingot, bar, or sheet; and gold coins. Imports of gold jewelry require specific import licenses as Schedule III items and no foreign exchange is allocated for them; import licenses for gold bul- lion (ingots, bars, or sheets) are issued to goldsmiths only and are issued restrictively, while imports of gold coins are not being licensed. Changes during 1973 January 1. As a measure to prevent overinvoicing, virtu- ally all imports were made subject to inspection as to qual- i ty, quan t i ty, and price before shipment. Authorized banks were instructed not to make payments for nonexempt imports un t il a "Clean Report of Findings" had been received from the General Superintendence Company. Exemptions included goods with a pro forma invoice value of less than K Sh 20,000, most public sector imports, supplies for diplo- matic missions and international organizations not involving the provision of foreign exchange from Kenya, and imports from specified countries w i th which trade agreements were in force. Imports of specialized capital equipment could be ex- empted provided prior arrangements were made with the Exchange Control Department of the Central Bank. January 4. Authorized banks were instructed not to issue shipping guarantees for the clearance of imports unless a "Clean Report of Findings" was submitted. February 13. Foreign exchange transactions were sus- pended. They were resumed on February 16. February 19. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the par value was changed from 0.114592 gram to 0.103133 gram of fine gold per Kenya shilling, corresponding to K Sh 8.61675 = SDR 1. Kenya continued to avail itself of wider margins. The effective par- ity relationship for the U.S. dollar remained unchanged at K Sh 7.14286 = US$1. The relationship to the Tanzania shilling and the Uganda shilling also remained unchanged. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution March 2. Foreign exchange transactions were suspended, with the exception of facilities for tourists; dealings were resumed on March 13. March 5. Residents traveling abroad on international flights and holding return tickets were allowed to take out up to K Sh 100 in domestic currency, to be used only to defray minor expenses on return. Previously, there was a total prohi- bition on the import and export of domestic banknotes. March 7. The Central Bank lifted the restrictions on com- mercial bank lending for hire-purchase of most imported goods other than passenger motor vehicles and durable con- sumer appliances. March 9. The Central Bank rescinded most restrictions on credit granted by nonbank financial institutions. It expressed the hope that as a result of the amendments to its credit control directives any additional hire-purchase business would be directed mainly to the finance of capital equipment and commercial vehicles and that new bank borrowing for consumer imports other than private passenger motor vehi- cles would be made available to new African enterprises. March 13. The exchange rate for the U.S. dollar was pegged at K Sh 7.0000 = US$1. April 16. The Sales Tax Bill, 1973 introduced w i th immedi- ate effect a 10 per cent sales tax on a wide range of imported goods. Af ter enactment, the tax was also applied to goods manufactured in Kenya from imported materials. April 27. The Central Bank withdrew all requests to com- mercial banks to restrict credit to importers. June 14. The Finance Bill, 1973 repealed the Export Duty Act. Export taxes on coffee and sisal were eliminated. June 14. The Local Manufacturers (Export Compensation) Bill, 1973 was introduced. It provided for export subsidies on exports of selected manufacturers to countries other than Tanzania and Uganda. The proposed rate of compensation payment was 10 per cent of the f.o.b. value of goods declared for payment or of the payment in respect of such export received in foreign currency (other than Tanzania or Uganda currency) by an authorized dealer, whichever was less. The bill was gazetted on January 11, 1974 but had not been made operational by April 1974. KENYA June 30. Kenya established a central rate of K Sh 6.90000 = US$1, equivalent to 0.106763 gram of fine gold per Kenya shilling and corresponding to K Sh 8.32377 = SDR 1. Kenya continued to avail itself of wider margins. The relationship to the Tanzania shilling and the Uganda shilling remained un- changed. July 1. Exporters and export agencies were required to register w i th the Central Bank and provide information con- cerning their foreign exchange earnings over the preceding two years. July 2. The import system was liberalized. Commodity Schedules A, B, C, D, and E were replaced by four new lists. Schedule I comprised items subject to specific import licens- ing for which exchange allocation licenses would be granted automatically. Schedule II comprised goods subject to spe- cific import licenses for which exchange would be provided on a quota basis. Schedule III comprised items subject to specific import licensing for which foreign exchange would not be provided. Schedule IV covered items not subject to specific import licenses for which foreign exchange would be allocated on a quota basis; only one item was on this list: passenger motor vehicles (other than buses or special vehi- cles), whether or not assembled. Exemptions from the new arrangements included public sector and East African Community imports, capital goods subject to deferred payment terms, and shipments valued at K Sh 2,000 or less c.i.f. (provided the goods concerned did not require a specific import license). All goods not on one of the Schedules were on open general license; such imports had to be preregistered with the Central Bank but were automatically entitled to foreign exchange allocation. July 20. The Central Bank requested nonbank f inan- cial institutions to refrain from financing the activities of foreign-controlled companies in Kenya. November I. Certain benefits w i th regard to the restrictions on local borrowing were granted to foreign firms and compa- nies with substantial equity holdings by Kenyan nationals. Facilities for other companies having resident participation also were improved. 261 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Exchange Rate System Administration of Control KHMER REPUBLIC No par value for the currency of the Khmer Republic, the Riel, has been agreed w i th the Fund. The exchange rate struc- ture comprises a basic exchange rate and a preferential rate. In the closing mon ths of 1973 the margin between the prefer- ential rate and the basic rate was maintained at KR 45 per US$1. The basic or general rate for sales of foreign exchange is set twice weekly by the National Bank of Cambodia (the central bank) in an exchange market referred to as "the new exchange market," in the light of market conditions; on De- cember 31, 1973 the basic rate was KR 302 per US$1, selling; the National Bank buys foreign exchange at a rate 0.4 per cent below the selling rate. l The preferential exchange rate is applicable only to aid imports and related services procured direct from donor countries (other than impor ts under U.S. P.L. 480); on December 31, 1973 the preferential rate was KR 257 per US$1. An effective exchange rate of KR 55 = US$ 1 results from the payment of a subsidy on the basic rate and is applicable to government transfers to Khmer diplo- matic, consular, and religious missions abroad and to trans- fers by students for the purchase of textbooks. On the supply side of the market all export proceeds and other foreign exchange receipts are subject to compulsory surrender. In addition to these receipts the market is also supplied w i th foreign exchange under certain aid programs. Exchange earnings from all permissible exports are channeled through the commercial banks to be converted at the ex- change rate established by the National Bank for any given market day; commercial banks must sell all export proceeds to the National Bank through the foreign exchange market w i thout delay. On the demand side, foreign exchange is pur- chased by commercial banks to finance all imports except for those that are either financed under the U.S. Commod i ty Import Program (CIP) and P.L. 480 programs or are made sans devises; in addition, all permissible payments for invisi- bles and capital are channeled through this marke t. Participation in the market is limited to authorized com- mercial banks which buy and sell foreign exchange in transac- tions w i th the National Bank; they act on behalf of customers only and are not allowed to ma in ta in foreign exchange bal- ances for trade purposes, except as these may arise in connec- tion w i th their normal operations. Foreign exchange transactions of the Government and its depar tmen ts and agencies are subject to the same cond i t ions as transac t ions of the private sector, but are generally channeled th rough the National Bank. The National Bank of Cambodia ma in ta ins official quo ta- tions for 13 currencies.2 These quotations all provide for a spread of 0.4 per cent between the buy ing and selling rate expressed in riels. 1 On Janua ry 3, 1974 the basic rate was depreciated to KR 375 = US$1 and the preferential rate to KR 302 = US$1. 2 Au s t r a l i an dollars, Belgian francs, Danish k rone r, deutsche m a r k, French francs, Hong Kong dollars, Japanese yen, Ne the r lands gu i lde rs, pounds s te r l ing, Singapore dollars, Swedish k rono r, Swiss francs, and U.S. do l lars. 262 Exchange control is administered by the National Ex- change Office, an au tonomous agency w i th in the National Bank; th is office is empowered to au thor ize all operations related to settlements w i th foreign countries, to foreign in- vestments, and to nonresident accounts. The Ministry of Commerce is in charge of the adm in is tra t ion of import and export controls. The Exchange Support Fund, an indepen- dent un it w i th in the Na t ional Bank, reimburses the latter for foreign exchange sold for most general impo r ts and for freight and insurance on impo r ts provided under U.S. P.L. 480. Prescription of Currency Settlements w i th f ive countries w i th which the Khmer Re- public has bilateral payments arrangements are made th rough bilateral accounts. Those maintained for Czechoslo- vakia, Eastern Germany, and the U.S.S.R. are denominated in pounds sterling, and those for Bulgaria and Poland in U.S. dollars. Settlements w i th other countries take place in con- vertible currencies. Foreign inves tmen ts must be made in a currency accept- able to the National Bank. Profits on and proceeds from the liquidation of foreign inves tmen ts may be transferred abroad in the currency in wh ich the inves tment was made. Nonresident Accounts The fo l low ing categories of account may be maintained for nonresidents: Foreigners' Accounts in Riels, Capital Ac- counts, Nonresident Accounts, and Foreign Currency Ac- coun ts. In add i t ion, Khmer na t iona ls s tay ing abroad temporarily but not recognized as nonresidents, and foreign- ers staying in the Khmer Republic but not recognized as residents, may ma in ta in In te rnal Accounts of Nonresidents. There are separate regulations concerning nonresident ac- counts th at may be used to f inance transactions in the free trade area of Kompong-Som. Foreigners' Accounts in Riels may be opened, w i thout per- mission, for foreigners residing outside the Khmer Republic. They are related to the coun t ry of residence of the account holder. They may be freely credited w i th (1) proceeds from the sale on the Phnom Penh exchange ma rket of the currency (but not banknotes) of the coun t ry of the account holder; (2) paymen ts for authorized imports ( inc lud ing incidental ex- penses) from the coun t ry of the account holder; (3) earnings on inves tmen ts in the Khmer Republic and receipts from repayments on Khmer stocks and bonds and on other invest- ments made in the Khmer Republic a f ter May 1956; and (4) interest paid by the banks on f u n ds kept in the accounts.

Imports and Import Payments The import of certain commodities is prohibited for rea- sons of health or security and that of certain other goods for protective reasons. In view of the ava i lab i l i ty of subs tan t ial amounts of commercial aid resources, several impor tant im- port commodities have been placed on an "exclusive list"; their impo r ta t ion is permitted on ly against commodity aid f inanc ing, unless a waiver is granted. The list includes to- bacco leaves, cotton fibers, certain vegetable oils, wheat f lour, and cotton thread under the U.S. P.L. 480 program, and some foods tu f fs, rubber and rubber products, petroleum, chemicals, timber and paper products, iron and steel, metals, cars and trucks, and U.S. equipment in general, under the U.S. CIP. For all other permissible imports, including those eligible for CIP f inanc ing that are not on the "exclusive list," cash foreign exchange resources are provided w i thout restric- tions; they are referred to as general imports. General imports of up to US$ 1,000 for each shipment may be made freely when no purchase of foreign exchange is in- volved (sans devises) and the goods are not intended for resale. All imports financed by foreign exchange purchased in the exchange market must be settled against irrevocable letters of credit opened by the commercial banks. Importers are re- quired to subm it their requests for purchases of foreign ex- change to the commercial banks, accompanied by a payment in riels equal to the cost of the foreign exchange requested, calculated at the latest quo ta t ion for the currency concerned. A supplementary deposit in riels, the amount of which is varied from time to time, is also required; at the end of 1973 the supplementary deposit required was equivalent to 300 per cent of the cost of the foreign exchange involved. Certain government agencies and commercial firms are exempt from the supp lemen tary deposit requ iremen t. In the ir requests for exchange importers must state the most depreciated exchange rate they are prepared to pay. Twice weekly the National Bank considers the applications received and sets its selling rate. An importer's application is met in fu ll at the current selling rate if his bid specified that rate or a less appreciated rate; if he has indicated a more appreciated rate than the one actually established, he will not be able to obtain exchange and his deposit is refunded. The supplementary deposits of successful bidders are refunded when the shipping documents are taken up at the bank where the letter of credit was opened. In order to facilitate the efficient utilization of available commercial aid resources, preferential local currency pay- ment facilities have been extended to importers who are will- ing to finance imports th rough aid. The local currency cost of CIP imports is settled as follows: (1) in the case of pur- 263 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution KHMER REPUBLIC chases from the United States, the importer must pay 10 per cent of the import value in riels at the time the import applica- tion is approved by the Societe Nationale d'Exportation et d'Importation (SONEXIM), and the remainder at the time of the presentation of documents by the commercial bank; (2) where SONEXIM is buying directly from "Code 941" coun- tries, 3 the importer must pay 25 per cent of the import val- ue in riels at the time of delivery of the import certificate by SONEX IM and the remainder at the time of presentation of documents. The 75 per cent due on presentation of the docu- ments may be financed by commercial bank credits. In the case of imports from the United States, the credits are ex- tended for a period of four months, while two-mon th credits are available for CIP imports from th ird countries. Each importer is required to obtain an import business license. Importers are permitted to trade w i th foreign countries only if they have assumed corporate status (so- cietes anonymes). The equ i ty capital of such corporations should be at least KR 5 million; 51 per cent of the equ i ty should be held by Khmer nationals and one th i rd of board membership should be Khmer. Upon completion of the import transaction, importers are required to submit proof that the foreign exchange has actu- ally been used to finance imports, and that the goods have arrived and have been cleared through customs w i th fu ll payment of import du ty and other levies. Payments for Invisibles Importers include an estimate of the freight and insurance component of the cost of imports in their bids for foreign exchange for imports. If actual fre ight and insurance costs exceed the estimate, a separate bid for the additional amount must be submitted. Foreign exchange for freight and insur- ance for imports under U.S. P.L. 480 is eligible for f inanc ing by the CIP. All other payments for invisibles require individ- ual authorization, and only those transactions explicitly men- tioned in the exchange control regulations are permitted. A foreigner work ing in the Khmer Republic and receiving a mon th ly salary exceeding KR 5,000 in Phnom Penh, or KR 3,500 in the provinces, may in principle t rans fer up to 30 per cent of his net mon th ly salary —after payment of taxes— plus 15 per cent of his mon th ly salary if a dependent w ife stays abroad, plus an additional 10 per cent if dependent children, parents, or grandparents stay abroad. (The addi- tional percentage of transferable income is 2 per cent for each legitimate child or dependent parent or grandparen t, w i th a maximum of 10 per cent of the net mon th ly income for each fam i ly .) Such transfers may not exceed the equivalent of KR 20,000 a worker a mon th. Transfer facilities are not granted for salaries and wages exempt from income tax. Over- time pay is considered transferable income only when it is received in payment for courses given in public educational ins t i tu t ions. Women of foreign na t iona l i ty married to Khmer nationals and wo rk ing in the private sector are not permitted to transfer savings from salaries or wages to the ir coun t ry of origin. 3 Certain developing countries in Asia and Africa. 264 Foreign landlords domiciled in the Khmer Republic may transfer up to 30 per cent of the taxable portion of their income from rent, provided that the rent exceeds KR 5,000 for landlords living in Phnom Penh or KR 3,500 for landlords living in the provinces. Foreign landlords living abroad may transfer up to 20 per cent of the taxable portion of rent. Foreigners residing in the Khmer Republic, when leaving the coun t ry permanently, are permitted to transfer abroad, up to prescribed limits, savings out of their salaries earned in the Khmer Republic, provided that the savings have been regu- la r ly deposited w i th an authorized bank in the Khmer Repub- lic. The transfer of the fu ll net prof i ts from nonresident invest- ments made prior to May 31, 1956 is authorized, subject to proof that the investment was made w i th foreign currency other than the former Indo-Chinese piastre; otherwise, the transfer of profits on pre-1956 investments is limited to 80 per cent and is permitted only if the investment is recognized as useful to the economic development of the Khmer Republic. Net prof i ts that do not exceed 20 per cent of foreign invest- ments made after May 31, 1956 may be transferred annually. Khmer nationals s tudy ing abroad may receive monthly exchange allocations equivalent to up to US$108 for Asian countries and up to US$126 for any other country, in addition to installation, holiday, and clothing allowances. The alloca- tion of foreign exchange for tourist travel and business travel has been suspended. The export of Khmer currency is prohibited and foreign tourists require special authorization to reconvert riels into foreign currency. Exports and Export Proceeds Exporters must obtain annual registration licenses from the Ministry of Finance. Exports are classified into three groups: a prohibited list, a licensing list, and a free list. Pro- hibited exports comprise mainly goods whose exports have been banned for social and political reasons, while the pur- pose of the licensing list is to avoid shortages of supplies needed for domestic use. The exportation of rubber and pre- cious and semiprecious stones is a state monopoly and is effected through SONEX IM. All other commodities may be freely exported, provided that the transactions are arranged th rough a commercial bank, which must issue an export cer- tificate for each shipment. A Committee on Export Price Quotations sets weekly m in imum export prices. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles must be surrendered. Approved hotels, airlines, and other organizations authorized to receive payment in foreign exchange are required to keep adequate records of such transactions and to surrender all receipts to the commercial banks at least once weekly. Foreign visitors are required to settle their hotel bills in foreign currency or provide evidence that local currency was acquired by selling foreign exchange to an authorized bank. The import of Khmer currency is prohibited. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Capital All capital transfers require individual licenses. No transfer abroad of proceeds from the sale of property by a foreigner to a foreigner is permitted. Foreigners who sell their property to Khmer nationals and leave the Khmer Republic perma- nently may transfer in i t ia l ly up to 20 per cent of the proceeds of the sale; up to 20 per cent of the remainder may be autho- rized for transfer annually, when the total amount involved is small. Funds representing the repayment of loans originally granted in foreign currency may be considered transferable income. Since May 31, 1956, all foreign investments have been subject to authorization from the Ministry of Finance, which requires that a certain percentage of the capital of an enter- prise should be reserved for Khmer participation and that its employees should be Khmer nationals. Only investments for the creation of activities recognized as useful to the economic development of the coun try and not involving monopoly or special privilege may be authorized. Proceeds from the liqui- dation of authorized investments made after May 31, 1956 may be transferred in yearly installments not exceeding 20 per cent of the total investment. Up to 10 per cent of the proceeds from the liquidation of investment made prior to May 31, 1956 may be authorized for transfer every year. Foreign capital invested after May 31, 1956 is guaranteed the same tax treatment that is applied to resident investments; in addition, special incentives (partial exemption from duties and taxes on reinvested profits and on equipment goods or raw materials imported during the first year of operation) may be accorded to foreign investment considered as excep- tionally useful to the Khmer economy. There is a guarantee of 10-30 years against risks of nationalization or expropria- tion, and for a just and equitable indemn i ty in the event of nationalization or expropriation of investments. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in the Khmer Republic for numismatic purposes. With this exception, resi- dents other than the monetary authorities, SONEXIM, and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require authorization by the National Bank; such authoriza- tion is not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and SONEXIM. Changes during 1973 During the year, the basic exchange rate was gradually depreciated from KR 187 = US$1 to KR 302 = US$1, and the preferential exchange rate from KR 131 = US$1 to KHMER REPUBLIC KR 257 = US$1. January 19. The supplementary deposit required on gen- eral imports was raised from 200 per cent to 400 per cent. Subsequently, it was reduced to 300 per cent on January 26, to 200 per cent on May 19, and to 100 per cent on May 30. April 9. Notice No. 106 of the National Exchange Office tightened the conditions for the granting of foreign exchange for medical treatment abroad. April 12. The initial payment in riels required on CIP im- ports was raised to 50 per cent for all sources. April 18. Imports of certain luxury items (including alco- holic beverages, cosmetics, automobiles, light trucks, and motorcycles) were suspended pending introduction of new import taxes. The suspension ended on June 16, when higher customs duties were imposed on the products involved. July 24. Instruction No. 89 of the Exchange Office modi- fied its Instruction No. 81 of January 30, 1970 Residents were freely permitted to deposit foreign exchange in various forms, including banknotes and travelers checks, in resident foreign currency accounts. Formerly such deposits were lim- ited to bank transfers. July 24. Circular No. 3 of the Exchange Office modified the regulations governing payments for travel tickets. Resident and nonresident physical and juridical persons could freely settle these in foreign banknotes and foreign currency travel- ers checks. The prior approval of the Exchange Office was required for payment in riels. July 26. The amount up to which general imports could be made freely on a sans devises basis was increased from US$500 to US$1,000. August 13. The requirement of a supplementary import deposit of 100 per cent was eliminated. Initial payments re- quired on CIP imports were reduced to 10 per cent for goods from U.S. sources and 25 per cent for goods from "Code 941" countries. The preferential interest rate for CIP import fi- nancing was eliminated. August 27. The basic exchange rate was changed from KR 230 = US$1 to KR 250 = US$1 and the preferential rate from KR 161 = US$1 to KR 200 = US$1. The margin between the two rates, previously maintained at 30 per cent, was reduced to 20 per cent. October 18. The basic exchange rate was changed to KR 275 = US$1 and the preferential rate to KR 230 = US$1. A policy was adopted of maintaining the margin between the two rates at KR 45 per US$1. October 25. Supplementary deposits on general imports were reintroduced, at a level of 300 per cent. The deposit period was fixed at three months, but this provision was eliminated on November 28. December. Freight and insurance on imports under U.S. P.L. 480, which previously had to be settled in the "new exchange market," became eligible for financing under the CIP. 265 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution KOREA Exchange Rate System No par value for the Korean Won has been established w i th the Fund. Since March 22, 1965 there has been a fluctu- a t ing exchange rate determined in an exchange certificate marke t. On December 31, 1973 the buy ing and selling rates of the Bank of Korea for the U.S. dollar were W 396.90 and W 398.10, respectively, and the telegraphic t rans fer buy ing and selling rates of the foreign exchange banks were W 396.5 and W 398.5, respectively. Exchange certificates valid for 45 days are issued by the foreign exchange banks against all foreign exchange earnings in prescribed currencies surrendered by residents. All foreign exchange proceeds, however, may a l terna t ive ly be exchanged for won at the buy ing rate posted by the foreign exchange banks. Exchange certificates are in principle required for all foreign exchange expenditures except for paymen ts for im- ports financed under U.S. aid programs, and paymen ts by commercial banks in connection w i th their b ank ing transac- tions, etc. There is a limited forward exchange ma rket re- stricted to exporters covering their export earnings; the foreign exchange banks may in tu rn cover their fo rwa rd transactions with exporters by engaging in such transactions abroad. Administration of Control The Ministry of Finance is in charge of exchange control, subject to the approval of the Cabinet. It carries out policy w i th respect to prescription of currency and method of settle- men t, foreign exchange operations, payments for nonmer- chandise transactions, and capital transactions and transfers. The Bank of Korea, as the Government's agent, executes the above functions in part; it regulates operations in the certifi- cate market and is authorized to intervene in it. The Bank has also been delegated au tho r i ty to control receipts and pay- ments related to invisibles. The Korea Exchange Bank, whose capital is wholly subscribed by the Government and the Bank of Korea, has taken over from the latter all its in terna t ional bank ing and foreign exchange business. The foreign exchange banks, as well as the branch offices in Korea of foreign banks, are authorized to deal in foreign exchange. The trade program for imports financed from Korea's own foreign exchange resources (KFX) is prepared by the Minis- try of Commerce and Indus t ry. Imports financed by foreign grants and loans are programmed separately by the Eco- nomic P lann ing Board in consultation w i th the M in is t ry of Commerce and Indus t ry, and import licenses are issued by the foreign exchange banks. Prescription of Currency All settlements between Korea and other countries are made in convertible currencies. The proceeds of exports must be obtained in prescribed currencies. * The methods of pay- 1 Aus t ra l ian dollars, Au s t r ian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche m a rk, French francs, Hong Kong dollars, Italian lire, Ne ther lands guilders, Norwegian k rone r, pounds s te r l ing, Swedish k rone r, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. 266 ment on account of other settlements require the approval of the M in i s t ry of Finance. Nonresident Accounts Nonresident and Korean workers abroad may maintain foreign currency deposit accounts w i th foreign exchange banks. Remittances from such accounts and withdrawals in the form of currency notes upon departure from Korea may, in general, be made freely. The approval of the bank where the account is held is required for remittances from balances that have accrued f rom remunera t ion for services in Korea, air or ship passage fares, or insurance premiums received in Korea, or f rom exchange deposited in accordance w i th a decision of the M in i s t ry of Finance (except exchange regis- tered at the customs on en t ry or remitted from abroad). The deposits may be disposed of by sale to a foreign exchange bank at the prevailing exchange rate, and they may be debited for salary payments to foreign employees. Foreign residents and nonresidents are permitted to hold time deposit accounts in prescribed currencies w i th the foreign exchange banks. Certain residents of Korean na t iona l i ty, such as the airline and some insurance companies, as well as exporters w i th a specified m in imum annual export performance, may ma in ta in current deposit accounts in foreign currencies w i th the foreign exchange banks. Companies registered to operate in the Ma- san Free Export Zone also may ma in ta in current deposit accounts in foreign currencies w i th the foreign exchange bank w i th in the zone. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Rhodesia are prohibited. All imports require licenses; for certain impor ts (see below) licenses are issued upon application. No licenses are issued for any goods origi- na t ing in the People's Republic of China, Cuba, No r th Korea, or Nor th Viet-Nam and for certain impor ts from all other countries. Imports are divided in to three categories: those paid for w i th Korean foreign exchange (so-called KFX imports), those paid for w i th foreign aid funds, and those financed by Japanese reparations (PAC imports). KFX imports are clas- sified as au toma t ic approval, restricted, or prohibited items. All commodities may be imported freely (i.e., applications for import licenses are au toma t ica l ly approved) unless they are in a list of restricted or prohibited commodities. Au toma t ic approval items (on December 31, 1973 these were 683 out of 1,312 basic items in the SITC classification) consist ma in ly of essential consumer goods not domestically produced and cer- tain raw materials and capital goods .2 Restricted items (556) in a negative list are subject to ind iv idual licenses. Prohibited items (73) are ma in ly l u x u ry goods, items prohibited for rea- sons of public health or morals, and some domestically pro- duced goods. Imports of raw materials for the production of 2 Some a u t om a t ic app roval i tems require the prior app roval of the M i n i s t ry of Commerce and I n d u s t ry when impor ted f r om Japan. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution exports are normally approved automatically, irrespective of their classification. Foreign aid imports are classified as either automatic approval items or restricted items. In principle, no commodities imported with foreign aid funds are included among the KFX imports, but in exceptional cases payment for imports usually financed with aid funds may be made w i th KFX exchange. For purposes of licensing imports from speci- fied countries, the position of Korea's balance of trade w i th the coun try concerned is taken in to account. Import licenses are granted only to registered traders; to maintain the status of a registered trader, a m in imum value of US$300,000 of exports is required each year for ord inary exporters. The commercial terms of payment on which imports may be contracted are regulated, and advance import deposits are required for most categories of imports by the private sector; these are met, for KFX imports, by deposit of exchange certificates a n d / or local currency at the time of app ly ing for import licenses. The exchange certificate deposits are, in ef- fect, advance payments offset against the import settlement; the won equivalent of any amount of deposit in excess of the import settlement is repaid to the importer at the time of the release of the relative bill of lading. Imports by the private sector under U.S. aid programs are subject to prior won cash payments of part of the import settlement, and imports w i th Japanese Property and Claims Funds (PAC imports) are sub- ject to prior payments of part of the import settlement in exchange certificates. Advance deposits for KFX imports range between 5 per cent and 200 per cent according to the na ture of the import and the commercial terms of payment; the rates are 100-200 per cent for imports against sight letters of credit, 5 per cent to 40 per cent for documents against acceptance (D /A) im- ports, and 20 per cent to 60 per cent for imports on a docu- ments against payment (D /P) basis and bonded warehouse transaction (BWT) terms. Advance deposits for KFX im- ports of raw materials for exports are 100 per cent, except for imports for stockpiling and D /P and D /A imports which are subject to a 10 per cent advance deposit. Imports of equip- ment and facilities for export industries financed w i th domes- tic loans in foreign exchange are not subject to advance deposits; payment (in exchange certificates) of 10 per cent of the import value is required upon the release of bills of lading, with the balance of the payment to be settled in accordance with the terms of the loan. The customs tariff is a "flexible" ta r i f f. Furthermore, the Government may alter import du ty rates adm in is tra t ive ly by up to 50 percentage points. The Government also has author- ity to impose import surcharges of up to 30 per cent on all dutiable imports. KOREA use exchange earnings up to US$2,000 a mon th for the ex- penses of their overseas branches; the authorization is US$3,000 a mon th if exports to the coun t ry concerned exceed US$1 million and US$5,000 a mon th if exports to the coun t ry concerned exceed US$5 million. All residents departing for travel abroad may purchase foreign exchange up to the equiv- alent of US$65 a day; they may purchase an additional US$100 for each tr ip for extra expenses. Students s tudy ing abroad may receive a mon th ly l iv ing allowance of up to US$500. Foreign and Korean currency notes may not be exported w i thout special permission. Nonresident foreigners need not register foreign exchange in specified currencies that they bring in to Korea and, when departing, they may recon- vert unused won notes in to U.S. dollars up to US$200, sub- ject to confirmation of the original sale of exchange (up to US$50 w i thout such conf irma t ion). Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to the People's Republic of China, Cuba, No r th Korea, Rhodesia, and No r th Viet-Nam are prohibited, as are exports of certain goods (such as raw cotton, p la t inum ores, wood charcoal, pu lp, and waste paper) to all other countries. Certain exports require ind iv idual licenses. All other exports may be made free ly under an automatic approval procedure. The export proceeds in foreign exchange must either be sur- rendered to a foreign exchange bank at the market rate or be exchanged in to equivalent foreign exchange certificates. However, traders w i th an annual export performance of US$1 million or more are permitted to retain their export proceeds as foreign currency demand deposits w i th foreign exchange banks, for use for approved payments. Proceeds from Invisibles All proceeds derived from invisibles must either be sold to a foreign exchange bank or be exchanged for equivalent ex- change certificates. Travelers may bring w i th them any amount of foreign exchange. Capital All capital remittances require approval. Foreign capital investment, loans from abroad, and imports of capital goods on a long-term basis can secure a guarantee of repayment and repatriation under the Foreign Capital Inducement Law. No limits are placed on the conversion and remittance of legiti- mate profits and dividends, or on the repatriation of the original capital invested. Gold Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require individual licenses. Pay- ments for invisibles connected w i th foreign trade transactions and for certain other items, such as bank ing charges, insur- ance premiums, communication fees, and periodicals are li- censed automatically. There are certain standard allocations for business travel. In addition, exporters are authorized to Certain commemorative gold coins are legal tender but do not circulate. By v ir tue of Law No. 233 of December 23, 1951 residents may freely buy, hold, and sell gold in any form in Korea. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry cons t i tu t ing the personal effects of a traveler require licenses issued by the M in is t ry of Finance; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on 267 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution KOREA behalf of the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users, and there have been no imports or exports since 1965. The leading producer of gold, a government-owned com- pany, may be required to sell gold to the Bank of Korea at US$42.22 an ounce. Otherwise, domestic production may be disposed of in the free market. The free market price at public gold auctions was about W 1,300 a gram at the end of 1973. Changes during 1973 January 1. The foreign exchange budget for 1973 went into effect. It was based on three general principles: (1) the capac- ity to repay foreign debts was to be increased by balancing the supply and demand for foreign exchange; (2) higher prior- ity was to be given to the expansion of export industries; and (3) nonessential imports and payments for invisibles were to be restricted, but not to the extent of obstructing the efficient supply of raw materials and of goods required for stable economic growth. Guidelines on the expenditure side in- cluded (1) an unchanged ceiling of US$235 million for D /A imports and one of US$480 million for imports on a ship- per's usance basis; (2) importers would in principle be re- quired to contract on an f.o.b. basis and use Korean-flag vessels; (3) the criteria for permission to travel abroad would be adjusted so as to reduce nonessential travel expenditure; (4) transfers of film rentals would not be permitted to exceed an amount fixed by the Minister of Finance; (5) agency com- missions on imports and exports would not normally be al- lowed to exceed 5 per cent of the invoiced import or export value; and (6) so as to improve the foreign debt structure, certain bank loans and commercial loans were to be repaid ahead of schedule. January L The trade program for the first half of 1973 went in to fu ll effect. On the import side, one item was shifted from the automatic approval category and one item in the reverse direction, resulting in a net liberalization of US$148,000 (on the basis of 1971 import values). The program was based on four general principles: (1) ensuring the timely and efficient supply of imported commodities in order to stabilize prices and to protect import industries; (2) checking machinery im- ports in order to foster the machinery industry; (3) improving the balance of payments by means of t ight import control over luxu ry goods and nonessential commodities; and (4) strengthening export support measures and restricting certain imports of raw materials for export in order to promote do- mestic production of these goods. January 15. Ministry of Finance Notice No. 549 amended the foreign exchange regulations with effect from January 16 to allow qualified exporters w i th annual export performance of US$5 million or more to retain their export proceeds as foreign currency demand deposits with Korean foreign ex- change banks. (Previously, this facility was available only to specified industries.) On December 1, the required annual export performance was reduced to US$1 million. January 22. A fu r ther amendment to the Trade Transac- tions Law came in to effect. It permitted trade w i th additional communist countries; trade with hostile nations, however, could be restricted or prohibited by Presidential Decree. (The January 1971 amendment had maintained the prohibition on 268 trade w i th the People's Republic of China, Cuba, North Ko- rea, and Nor th Viet-Nam.) February L New import du ty rates came into effect. They were included in a substantially revised customs law promul- gated on December 30, 1972. The number of import items subject to tar iffs rose from 3,174 to 3,985. The rates of import du ty on 1,068 items, including daily necessities, raw materi- als, and equipment for industrial production, were lowered. Those on 440 items, including certain luxury goods, were raised. These changes reduced the average rate of import duty from 38.8 per cent to 31.3 per cent. February 5. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry an- nounced rules governing the import in the first half of the year of restricted items under its control. The Ministry would continue to restrict imports of nonessential and luxury goods to provide protection to local industries. However, the lists of import quota items and of export-linked import items were reduced. February 16. The Law Regarding the Inducement and Management of Public Loans was promulgated. It provided for detailed procedures to be followed by the public sector in obtaining and using foreign loans. February 17. The M in is try of Commerce and Industry an- nounced an easing of import restrictions on certain key raw materials; an increase in import quotas for the first half of the year from US$505,000 to US$2,375,000; a reduction in the number of quota items from 28 to 25; and a reduction by 18 in the number of items that may be imported only in linkage with export performance, the items concerned becoming eligi- ble for import on the recommendation of the competent au- thorities. February 17. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry raised the ceiling of US$235 million on D /A imports for 1973 by declaring all items, except grains, importable on a D/A basis. The settlement period for D/A imports was reduced from 365 days to 270 days. February 20. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the Government decided to main- tain the existing won /do l lar exchange rate of W 398.90 per U.S. dollar. February 23. The Cabinet approved a bill empowering the Government to invoke import surcharges when deemed nec- essary. Such surcharges could not exceed 30 per cent on dutiable imports. This legislation replaced the authority un- der the special tariff law, which had been abrogated. March 12. The Government promulgated the revised For- eign Capital Inducement Law. The Government would give priority in approving foreign investments to joint venture projects rather than to 100 per cent foreign-owned invest- ment projects, and would in principle limit foreign inves- tors' shares in joint ventures to 50 per cent or less. The Government could, however, grant exceptions to industries producing exclusively for export and not competing with domestic industries, and to industries in which direct foreign investments are generally allowed by other countries because of the introduction of technical know-how. March 22. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry a- mended the trade program for the first half of 1973 by liberal- izing the import of ten items (moved from the restricted to the ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution automatic approval category were petroleum and oils ob- tained from bituminous minerals, oxydized steel, benzene, polishes and creams, polyester f i lm, newsprint, alloy steel bars, pressure sterilizers, magnets, and special insulators), and by restricting the export of eight items (reinforcing bars, cotton yarn, plywood, nylon yarn, acrylic yarn, polyester yarn, raw silk, and polyester-cotton mixed fabrics). April 12. The Foreign Capital Inducement Law was amended. The amendments gave increased priority to projects in which foreign and Korean businessmen invest jointly; they also provided for approval of investments in kind, and for increased tax exemption. In addition, the amendments required that all enterprises in which foreign capital had been invested submit remittance schedules to the Minister of Finance not later than 90 days before the closing of each fiscal year, showing the amounts to be remitted abroad during the following year. Under the previous law, the remittance overseas of proceeds from sales of stock or shares by a foreign investor was guaranteed only up to 20 per cent of the subscribed capital each year, beginning two years after the start of business operations; the amended law, in princi- ple, removed this restriction on the amounts to be remitted each year. April 14. The Ministry of Commerce and Indus t ry sus- pended, with some exceptions, the use of Korean-owned for- eign exchange (KFX) in financing imports from the United States; instead, the use of repayment letter of credit funds or of proceeds from exports to Viet-Nam (under the U.S. AID program for that country) would be required in order to expedite the utilization of such funds. May 14. The Monetary Board raised the interest rate on short-term bank loans for export financing from 6 per cent to 7 per cent. May 16. The M in is try of Commerce and Indus try an- nounced that six chemical items were importable by domestic manufacturers as well as end-users; in addition, import re- strictions applying to certain metals were relaxed. May 31. The Economic Ministers' Council approved an amendment to the implementation decree for the Foreign Capital Inducement Law. Foreign loans were required to be over US$200,000 in value each, and to be repayable over more than three years. May 31. The Ministry of Commerce and Indus try pub- lished the trade program for the second half of 1973; the program went in to effect on July 1, except the stipulations regarding changes of items from the automatic approval cate- gory to the restricted category, which took effect immedi- ately. On the import side, six items were moved from the prohib- ited category to the restricted category and thus became im- portable subject to the recommendation of the M in is try of Commerce and Indus try. Five items were moved from the automatic approval category to the restricted category. As a result, there were 73 import items in the prohibited category, 556 in the restricted category, and 683 in the automatic ap- proval category. June 5. The Ministry of Commerce and Indus try an- nounced that foreign investments in the fiber industry would be restricted w i th a view to protecting local textile producers. KOREA The M in is try would allow joint ventures with foreign inves- tors only when necessary technical know-how or capital was not available domestically. June 22. The Government raised the ceiling for 1973 on usance imports from US$480 million to US$566 million. July 16. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry revised the trade program for the second half of 1973. It moved 13 import items, mostly iron and steel products, from the re- stricted to the automatic approval category, and eased restric- tions on a number of items importable upon recommendation of the Ministry concerned. Six fertilizer and tallow-based items were shifted from the automatic approval export list to the restricted list. July 16. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry an- nounced the import regulations for the second half of 1973 for quota items, link items, and recommendation items, as well as machinery parts. July 26. Presidential Decree No. 61779 exempted eight agricultural commodities, including rapeseed oil, palm oil, and fish oil, from import duties. August 16. The redeposit requirements against banks' for- eign exchange transactions were tightened; the percentage of guarantee funds deposited in foreign currency by their cus- tomers that foreign exchange banks had to redeposit with the Bank of Korea in the form of foreign currency was increased from 70 to 85, while the redeposit requirement for won guar- antee funds remained at 100 per cent. August 16. The Bank of Korea, by revising its regulations on lending in foreign currencies, allowed banks to finance the exploitation of overseas natural resources for domestic use, at maturities of up to five years and with an optional grace period of two years. September 10. It was announced that, in principle, Korean individuals would not be allowed to make overseas invest- ments. However, exceptions could be granted for those indi- viduals who were recommended by three or more persons who together own assets of W 50 million or more than 30 per cent of the total investment requirements. September 10. Export restrictions on cement were tight- ened. September 15. The limits on sales of foreign exchange for payments in respect of current invisibles were raised, as fol- lows: (1) the limit on miscellaneous invisible payments sub- ject to the permission of the Governor of the Bank of Korea was raised from US$1,000 to US$2,000; (2) the limit on other invisible payments subject to the permission of the presidents of Class "A" foreign exchange banks was raised from US$100 to US$200; (3) the limit on per diem travel expenses was raised from US$30 to US$65; (4) the limit on monthly resi- dence expenses was raised from US$1,000 to US$1,300; (5) the limit on monthly living expenses was raised from US$300 to US$500; and (6) the limit on monthly "legwork" expenses was raised from US$500 to US$600. November 1. The Monetary Board increased the official buying price for gold from US$38 to US$42.22 a fine ounce. November 21. Thirty agricultural chemicals were shifted from the automatic approval list to the restricted list and became importable only on the recommendation of the Minis- ter of Agriculture and Fisheries. 269 ©International Monetary Fund.

Increased emphasis was placed on the timely procurement of needed raw materials. The Minister of Com- merce and Indu s t ry could allow the import of prohibited import items or prohibit the export of automatic approval import items as he deemed necessary. The breakdown of import items by category again was 683 automatic approval items, 556 restricted items, and 73 prohibited items. 3 December 1.

The Government announced that financial support would be given by commercial banks to importers of 26 major raw materials, including crude petroleum, raw cot- ton, grains, various petrochemicals, various metals, chemi- cals, fertilizers, and na tural rubber. This support would be given in the form of bank loans to cover the advance depos- it requirements. The amounts were announced on Decem- ber 19. The allotment for D /A or usance transactions implied an increase in import quotas for the commodities concerned. Furthermore, the max imum settlement period for D/A or usance imports was increased from three mon ths to six mon ths, provided the goods were shipped not later than May 31, 1974. December 8. The 1973 quota for the import of raw sugar was increased from US$10 million to US$19.7 million. December 26. Import duties on crude petroleum and speci- fied petroleum products, as well as some other major raw materials, were suspended, and those on some other essential commodities were reduced.

The Central Bank of Kuwa it quotes daily buy ing and selling rates for sterling and U.S. dollars; on December 31, 1973, these were KD 0.68745 buying, and KD 0.68831 selling, respectively, for sterling, and KD 0.29650 buy ing, and KD 0.29688 selling, respectively, for U.S. dollars. On April 5, 1963, Kuwa it notified the Fund that it was prepared to forma l ly accept the obligations of Article V I I I, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control There is no exchange control and residents and nonresi- dents may freely purchase and sell foreign currencies in Ku- wait. Dealings in the currencies of Israel, Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa, however, are prohibited. General and indi- vidual import licenses are issued by the M in is t ry of Com- merce and Indus t ry. The limited control over exports is administered by the Customs and Ports Adm in is t ra t ion of the Ministry of Finance and Oil. Prescription of Currency Kuwait has ceased to be a Scheduled Territory in terms of the U.K. Exchange Control Act, 1947 but under current U.K. exchange control regulations continues to be regarded as a country of the Overseas Sterling Area. There are no prescription of currency requirements. All settlements w i th Israel, Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents may freely open accounts in Kuwa i ti d ina rs and foreign currencies. The use of such accounts is not re- stricted. Imports and Import Payments Import licenses are required for all private impor ts other than foodstuffs; licenses are issued freely, except for wheat, flour, and asbestos pipe. Registered importers hand l ing a variety of commodities may obtain a general license valid for one year. Other importers must obtain specific licenses for individual commodities, which are also valid for one year. All imports from Israel, including imports of Israeli manu fac tu re and those that contain Israeli materials or are manu fac tu red by companies financed by Israeli capital, and all imports f rom Portugual, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. Im- ports of a few items (mainly oxygen, certain steel pipes, alco- holic beverages, and used trucks and buses not using gasoline for fuel and over ten years old) are prohibited from all sources. To be registered, the importer must be either a Kuwa i ti citizen or a firm in which all partners are Kuwa i t is or a shareholding or limited liability company in which Kuwa i t is own at least 51 per cent of all stock. Commercial imports normally are l im i ted to registered importers. Impo r ts from any permitted source may be paid for freely. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles may be made freely, except to Is- rael, Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa.

Not for Redistribution Exchange Rate System Imports and Import Payments LAOS No par value for the Laotian Kip has been established w i th the Fund. The official exchange rate is K 600 = US$1. This rate applies to a few specified imports, to government pay- ments covered by the foreign exchange budget for official transactions, to a few types of private sector payments in respect of current invisibles, to the portion of export proceeds that must be surrendered (except for exports of timber, logs, plywood, and furn i ture) and to any proceeds from invisibles or capital voluntarily sold to the banking system. An ex- change rate of K 840 per US$1 results from the application of an exchange tax of 40 per cent to the official rate. This rate is applicable to all outward payments not eligible for the official rate. An exchange subsidy of K 220 per US$1, appli- cable to the official exchange rate, is granted on the proceeds from exports of timber, logs, plywood, and furn i ture. The exchange market is supplied mainly by the Foreign Exchange Operations Fund (FEOF), which sells to banks at K 605 = US$1. The commercial banks' selling rates are K 606 per US$1 for transactions eligible for official exchange and K 846 per US$1 for other transactions. Administration of Control FEOF sells and buys foreign exchange only in transactions with the four commercial banks and the Development Bank of Laos, which act for the account of their customers. The National Bank of Laos (the central bank) conducts foreign exchange transactions only with exporters mak ing the obliga- tory surrender of export proceeds, w i th Laotian public agen- cies selling their exchange receipts, and with foreign embassies and international organizations; receipts from these sources are used to meet the foreign exchange expendi- tures of the Laotian Government. The approval of the Ex- change Control Commission (Commission d'Octroi des Devises Etrangeres or CODE) in the Ministry of Finance is required for purchases of exchange by the public at the rate of K 600 = US$1; exchange authorization for certain invisi- bles eligible for this rate is granted, however, by the National Exchange Office in the Ministry of Finance, acting on behalf of CODE. The Foreign Trade Department of the Ministry of Economy issues export licenses and keeps an annual register of importers and exporters. Prescription of Currency No prescription of currency requirements are imposed on receipts or payments, but the National Bank provides and accepts only U.S. dollars, French francs, and pounds sterling. There is a bilateral payments agreement with the U.S.S.R. providing for payments to be made through a clearing ac- count maintained in French francs as the unit of account. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents other than foreign embassies and interna- tional organizations are not permitted to maintain accounts in foreign currencies with authorized banks. Importers must be listed on the annual register of import- ers, for which a yearly registration fee has to be paid to the Government. Imports of charcoal, bricks, matches, rubber sandals, coffee, ice cream, soft drinks, beer, detergents, oxy- gen, and plastic bags are prohibited, although they may be authorized when shortages arise. Financing at the official rate is permitted for a short list of commodities deemed essential. Letters of credit must be opened with the commercial banks for all import transactions settled at the official rate. * Import transactions at the official rate are subject to ex- change control approval. To apply for this approval, the importer is required to complete an exchange control form obtainable from the banks, which are to forward the form to the CODE. The latter applies various criteria in deciding on exchange applications, including the applicant's compliance with prevailing requirements regarding letters of credit, ad- vance import deposits, payment of import duties, and appro- priate use of previous exchange purchases. Import transactions for which no exchange is granted at the official rate may in practice be made freely at the rate of K 840 = US$1 or settled in the unofficial free market, where the rate is also about K 840 per US$1. On being notified that exchange approval will be granted the importer must w i th in 7 days (14 days outside Vientiane) make an advance import deposit in kips at the Treasury. The advance deposit requirement is 40 per cent of the c.i.f. value for imports from the Republic of China, Hong Kong, Singa- pore, and Thailand and 30 per cent of imports from all other sources; it is only applicable when imports are financed at the rate of K 600 per US$1. The CODE requires evidence of payment of this deposit before forward ing the exchange au- thorization form to the commercial bank. Before the deposits can be returned by the Treasury, the importer must show proof, including customs evidence, that the goods have ar- rived in Laos, that they have been properly priced, and that the transaction has generally conformed with the prevailing regulations on imports. Raw material imports by export in- dustries and installation equipment imported by firms bene- f i t ing from investment incentives are exempt from advance import deposit requirements. For customs valuation purposes, the exchange rate used for all imports is K 600 per US$1. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles other than expenses for medical treatment abroad and expenses of nonscholarship students are subject to the 40 per cent exchange tax. Payments eligible for the official rate are subject to exchange control approval by the CODE and most are restricted. Payments for all invisi- bles, however, may be made freely, provided that the 40 per cent exchange tax is paid. In all cases, applicants for exchange for current invisibles are required to complete forms indicat- ing their identity as well as the intended use of the desired 1 W i th effect from January 15, 1974 corrugated iron sheets ceased to be eligible for the official rate. 273 ©International Monetary Fund.

There are no regulations limiting the export of domestic or foreign bank- notes by travelers. Exports and Export Proceeds Exporters must pay an annual registration fee to the Gov- ernment. Exports of gold and silver are prohibited, except when made by or on behalf of the monetary authorities. All other exports are subject to authorization, but licenses nor- mally are automatically issued. Exports of timber and other forestry and wood products require the opening of a letter of credit. The fu ll proceeds from exports of timber and other wood and forestry products and 80 per cent of proceeds from all other exports must be surrendered to the National Bank in U.S. dollars, French francs, or pounds sterling at the off i- cial rate; the remainder may be kept abroad or used freely. Exporters are required to deposit w i th the National Bank, prior to domiciling the export license w i th th is Bank, the portion of their anticipated export proceeds that is subject to surrender; the National Exchange Office gives its visa only on export licenses that have been anno ta ted by the National Bank to show that this requirement has been complied w i th. Except for timber, an exporter may, however, be permitted to make a prior surrender of only 40 per cent of export value, the remaining 40 per cent being due in a max imum of ten days from the settlement of the transaction; a commercial bank's guarantee may be accepted by the National Bank in lieu of the in i t ial deposit. For timber, the corresponding advance surrender requ irement is 50 per cent of export va lue. Should an exporter be paid in a currency other than U.S. dollars, French francs, or pounds sterling, he must exchange the part that is subject to surrender in to one of the acceptable curren- cies. Exports of timber, logs, plywood, and fu rn i tu re are enti- tled to an exchange subsidy of K 220 per US$1. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange converted by foreign embassies, missions, representatives, and in s t i tu t ions to cover their official ex- penses in Laos must be surrendered at the official rate. All other receipts from invisibles may be retained by the recipi- ent. There are no regulations l im i t ing the import of foreign or domestic banknotes by travelers. Capital Under the Investment Law of February 1970, various in- centives are available to foreign investors in Laos. Capital inf low is free from exchange control regulations and the for- 274 eign exchange need not be surrendered; capital outflow is subject to the 40 per cent exchange tax but is not restricted. The purchaser of foreign exchange must iden t i fy himself, however, and indicate the purpose of the payment or transfer. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form w i th in the country. Banks and other residents who are recognized as industrial users or as importers of gold also may freely import gold in any form, subject to payment of 3.5 per cent customs du ty (calculated at the official rate for the U.S. dollar and US$42.22 an ounce). Exports of gold by or on behalf of physical or juridical persons other than the mon- etary authorities norma l ly are prohibited, w i th the exception of gold coins issued under Decree No. 784/PC of June 26, 1969. Commercial imports and exports of articles containing a m inor qu an t i ty of gold are freely permitted. Changes during 1973 February 7. Imports of beer ceased to be eligible for the official exchange rate. February 15.

The requirement of opening an import letter of credit, from which imports valued at US$1,000 or less had been exempt, was extended to all imports financed at the official exchange rate. March 28. Exports of timber were made subject to an export tax; at the same time, the export proceeds became eligible for an exchange subsidy of K 220 per US$1. The surrender requirement for the proceeds from timber exports was increased from 80 per cent to 100 per cent. The effective exchange rate for timber exports, net of export tax, became about K 720 per US$1. May 25. All exports of forestry and wood products had to be made on a letter of credit basis. June 1. Deferred payment of import duties no longer was allowed. July 31. A large number of goods were deleted from the list of import items eligible for the official exchange rate; the principal items remaining on the list were gas oil, fertilizers, m i lk, sugar, corrugated iron sheets, and paper. Payments for certain types of current invisibles, including those profit re- mittances not already settled at the K 840 rate, also ceased to be eligible for the official rate. September 6. The exchange subsidy of K 220 per US$1 was extended to exports of logs, plywood, and fu rn i tu re. November 22.

The par value of the rand is 1.04550 grams of fine gold per rand, which corresponds to R 1 = SDR 1.17648. However, no exchange transactions take place at the par value. The South African Reserve Bank quotes a middle exchange rate for the U.S. dollar of US$1.4900 per R 1. Exchange rates are based on the South African Reserve Bank's rates for the U.S. dollar against rand (US$1.4937 buying and US$1.4862 selling, per R 1) and the London market rates for the currencies con- cerned against the U.S. dollar. Lesotho has ceased to be a Scheduled Territory in terms of the U.K. Exchange Control Act, 1947 but under current U.K. exchange control regulations continues to be regarded as a country of the Overseas Sterling Area. Lesotho also forms part of the Rand Monetary Area, which is a single exchange control territory comprising Botswana, Lesotho, South Africa, and Swaziland. For purposes of exchange con- trol over transactions in securities or gold, residents of a member country of the latter area are not regarded as resi- dents of another member country. The M in is try of Finance controls all external currency transactions. No restrictions are applied to payments within the Rand Monetary Area, and in principle these are uncontrolled and unrecorded. In relation to countries outside the Rand Mone- tary Area, Lesotho applies exchange controls that are gener- ally similar to those of South Africa. Payments to nonresidents for current transactions, while subject to con- trol, are not restricted, but applications for outward transfers of capital are considered on their merits. The rulings on appli- cations for inward and outward capital transfers may depend on whether the applicant is a temporarily resident foreign national, a nonresident, or a resident. Au thor i ty to approve some types of current payments is delegated to commercial banks up to established limits; this is true, for example, of the basic exchange allowance for tourist travel (the equivalent of R 2,000 in a calendar year for an adult and R 800 for a child) and a smaller annual allocation for travel to neighboring countries. There are no bilateral payments arrangements. Lesotho is a member of a customs union with Botswana, South Africa, and Swaziland, and there are no import restric- tions on goods originating in any country of the customs union. Imports from South Africa do not require licenses and include an unknown quan t i ty of goods originating outside the customs union. Insofar as Lesotho imports goods direct from countries outside the customs union, such imports are usually licensed in conformity with South Africa's import regula- tions. Import licenses are valid for all countries and entitle the holder to buy the foreign exchange required to make the import payment. Lesotho's trade licensing arrangements, however, are designed mainly to raise revenue and to prevent tax evasion and are confined in practice to exports of dia- monds; permits are issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce. Certain tax incentives for inward direct investment are provided by the Pioneer Industries Encouragement Act, 1969 to manufac tur ing activities approved by a Pioneer Industries Board. Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell certain Lesotho gold coins that are legal tender. Changes during 1973 February 14. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the par value of the South African rand was maintained in terms of gold. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously R 0.782891 = US$1, became R 0.704603 = US$1. The South African Re- serve Bank announced a middle rate for the U.S. dollar of R 1 = US$1.4193, and its fixed rates for the U.S. dollar were changed to US$1.4229 buy ing and US$1.4157 selling, per R 1. June 5. The South African Reserve Bank henceforth quoted a middle exchange rate for the U.S. dollar of US$1.4900 per R 1. New official buying and selling rates were set at US$1.4937 and US$1.4862, respectively, per R 1. 276 ©International Monetary Fund.

U.S. currency is in circulation along with Liberian coinage and is legal tender. Official accounts are kept in dollars and cents. There are no restrictions on foreign ex- change transactions. surrender of the proceeds of exports is not required, and exchange receipts are freely disposable. An export tax is lev- ied on diamonds. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles There are no limitations on payments for or receipts from invisibles. Prescription of Currency Capital No prescription of currency requirements are in force. Imports and Import Payments There is no general system of import control. A few items (e.g., arms and ammunition, explosives, used clothing, and Pharmaceuticals) require prior licenses; no imports of shot- gun shells are permitted at present and only certain types of cement are imported. Also, imports of certain goods (e.g., obscene literature, narcotics other than for medicinal pur- poses) and all imports from Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. In practice, meat is imported primarily by the Liberian Supply Corporation and petroleum and pe- troleum products only by the Liberian Refining Company. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are pro- hibited. Export licenses are required for precious metals, pre- cious stones, ivory, agricultural products other than rubber, and certain other items, such as arms, ammunition, and ex- plosives. Licenses are issued freely; they serve ma in ly to en- force taxation or, for agricultural products, to assure certification of quality and origin and to safeguard the mo- nopoly of the Liberian Produce Marketing Corporation. The No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or payments by residents or nonresidents. Under an Investment Incentive Code, enterprises undertaking new in- vestment projects may be granted five-year to ten-year tax exemption and tariff exemptions on construction materials, raw materials, and capital goods to be used in manufacturing operations. Other possible benefits include tariff protection, subject to approval of the legislature. Gold Residents may freely and without license purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form are subject to licenses issued by the Minister of Finance; import licenses are issued freely but export licenses are granted restrictively. Changes during 1973 February 16. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar was maintained unchanged at $1 = US$1.

The U.S. dollar is the intervention cur- rency. The Central Bank of Libya publishes daily buy ing and selling rates for 15 currencies. 1 It deals w i th commercial banks only in pounds sterling and U.S. dollars, at rates fixed daily. The Central Bank's rates for the U.S. dollar on Decem- ber 31, 1973 were LD 0.29531 buying, and LD 0.29679 sell- ing, per US$1; for the pound sterling the buy ing and selling rates were LD 0.68407 and LD 0.68750, respectively, per £ stg. 1. The commercial banks are permitted to buy or sell other currencies against pounds sterling and U.S. dollars through their foreign correspondents. The commercial banks' buying and selling rates for currencies other than sterling and U.S. dollars are based on quotations in London, New York, and other centers abroad. They may not deal among themselves in foreign currencies. Neither authorized banks nor importers or exporters are allowed to enter in to forward commitments in foreign currencies. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Central Bank, which has delegated some of its powers to the authorized banks. Policy relating to import and export licensing is deter- mined by the Ministry of Economy. Import and export li- censes are issued by the Ministry of Economy; for certain imports the approval of another M in is try (Interior, Health, Agriculture and Agrarian Reform, or Defense) is required. Imports of petroleum and petroleum products, certain cere- als, flour, tea, sugar, salt, tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, cigarette paper, and a number of other commodities are a government monopoly. Imports of unprocessed gold are confined to the Central Bank. Prescription of Currency Settlements with other countries are made in convertible currencies, usually U.S. dollars or pounds sterling. Certain settlements with Romania, however, are channeled through special accoun ts .2 All settlements w i th Israel, Mozambique, Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited.

Legitimate earnings from employers of such nonresidents, including overtime payments, can be credited to their nonresident ac- counts. Similarly, authorized banks have authority to credit interest earned on balances in these nonresident accounts. All other credits to nonresident accounts require the prior ap- proval of the Central Bank. Remittances abroad from such accounts maintained by nonresident laborers and technicians can be allowed by banks up to 60 per cent of net salary each mon th; for those whose contracts specify that lodging and /or board will be made available free of charge by the employer, remittances up to 90 per cent of net salary are permitted. Banks may issue travelers checks and foreign currency notes to nonresident laborers and technicians within the limits men- tioned. Total permissible remittances in any calendar year from a nonresident account are reduced, however, by the value of specified imported goods (including automobiles and electrical domestic appliances) taken out by a nonresident when going abroad. Funds brought into the Libyan Arab Republic by nonresi- dent contractors undertaking contracts in their own names are required to be kept in "special resident accounts" with a bank in the Republic. Payments received in the Libyan Arab Republic by such contractors in respect of their contracts may also be credited to these accounts. Remittances from the Libyan Arab Republic to the debit of these accounts are subject to the prior approval of the Central Bank after sub- mission of all the prescribed evidence. Nonresident-owned capital that is not permitted to be transferred abroad is credited to blocked accounts. With the approval of the Central BanH, funds in blocked accounts (with certain exceptions) may be used for expenditures in the Libyan Arab Republic up to LD 500 a year to cover the cost of current visits to the Libyan Arab Republic by the owner of the funds or a close relative; for payments in the Libyan Arab Republic of legal fees, taxes, etc.; for remittances to the owner of the funds in his coun try of permanent residence, up to LD 1,000 in a calendar year; and for remittances in cases of hardship. When the funds have been in a blocked account for f ive years, they qua l i fy for remittances in fu ll to the owner in his coun try of permanent residence. The blocked accounts of persons (with certain exceptions) who have left the Libyan Arab Republic permanently are being released in install- ments; balances credited prior to March 31, 1966 have been released. Imports and Import Payments Import transactions are governed by Law No. 63 of 1971. Most imports are under open general license and do not require an individual import license. The import of some items, inc lud ing alcoholic beverages and narcotics, is prohib- ited. Imports of petroleum and petroleum products, sugar, salt, tea, rice, barley, wheat, f lour, olive oil, tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, and cigarette paper are subject to government mo- nopoly; they may be imported only by the National Oil Cor- poration, the National Supplies Corporation, or the Tobacco ©International Monetary Fund.

Imports from the United Kingdom of specified consumer goods are suspended. Exchange permits required for imports are readily granted by the authorized banks, provided that there is a firm con- tract and any necessary import license has been obtained and, if the import is to be made on a letter of credit basis, that a marine insurance policy from an insurance company in the Libyan Arab Republic is submitted before the letter of credit is established. However, no letter of credit in respect of the import of consumer durable goods may be opened by an authorized bank without obtaining a cash margin of 25 per cent of the import price. Importers must submit to the bank granting the exchange permit, w i th in two months of customs clearance, a customs declaration confirming clearance and stating the valuation. The approval of the Exchange Control Department of the Central Bank is required for advance pay- ments. Deferred payments (for up to 90 days after customs clearance) and payments for consignment shipments may be approved by the authorized banks. Imports are subject to customs du ty and customs sur- charges totaling 15 per cent of the applicable customs du ty. Payments for Invisibles The authorized banks are empowered to approve applica- tions by residents to remit foreign exchange up to LD 100 in a calendar year for meeting genuine personal commitments abroad of a noncommercial nature, including fam i ly assist- ance and gifts. They may also approve transfers abroad of up to LD 1,320 a year for each student (plus tuition fees, an allowance for books, etc.) for educational purposes, as well as allocations for travel as indicated below. Remittances from nonresident accounts may be approved by authorized banks up to certain limits (see section on Nonresident Accounts, above). All other payments for invisibles, as well as payments in excess of the approval au thor i ty delegated to the banks, require licenses from the Central Bank. Applications are con- sidered on their merits. Persons leaving the country may take with them Libyan currency notes not exceeding a total of LD 20 (LD 10 for children under 12); these may not be spent or exchanged outside the Libyan Arab Republic, but are intended for im- mediate expenses in the Libyan Arab Republic upon return to the country. Residents leaving for personal travel abroad, including tourist travel may, in addition, take out foreign exchange in the form of foreign currency notes, travelers checks, and letters of credit not exceeding a total value of LD 300 in a calendar year as a basic travel allowance; the exchange may be obtained from any authorized bank in the Libyan Arab Republic. Children under 12 years of age are allowed one half of this amount. Amounts in excess of the above may be granted in special circumstances. Pilgrims are entitled to a special quota of LD 300 in addition to the basic travel allowance. For business travel, residents may take out the equivalent of LD 500 a trip, subject to a max imum of LD 2,500 in any calendar year.

Exports of nonmonetary gold (other than for processing abroad), vegetable oils, and scrap metals are prohibited. All exports to Israel, Mozambique, Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. Exports of crude petroleum to the Netherlands and the United States are suspended. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange receipts from invisibles must be surren- dered. Travelers checks or foreign currency notes may be cashed only at an authorized bank or at an exchange office licensed by the Central Bank of Libya. Travelers entering the Libyan Arab Republic may bring w i th them Libyan currency notes, not exceeding a total of LD 20, and other currency notes, travelers checks, letters of credit, securities, coupons, and other negotiable instruments in unlimited amounts. Capital Many aspects of the activities of oil companies operating in the Libyan Arab Republic are governed by Petroleum Law No. 25 of 1955, as amended. Under the provisions of the Foreign Capital Investment Law No. 37 of July 31, 1968, foreign capital invested in projects deemed to contribute to the economic development of the country, as well as profits thereon, and salaries of foreign staff employed on such projects may be transferred freely to the coun try of origin, provided that the paid-up capital is not less than LD 200,000 and that at least 51 per cent of the shares is held by foreign nationals. Foreign participation in new industrial ventures (i.e., after March 20, 1970) is permitted only on a minority basis, and only if it leads to increased production in excess of local requirements, introduction of the latest technology, and cooperation w i th foreign firms in exporting the surplus pro- duction. Insurance companies and foreign shareholdings in banks have been nationalized. Commercial firms have been Libyanized in varying degrees. Real estate in the Libyan Arab Republic may be sold only to Libyans, save in exceptional circumstances specifed in a law of May 24, 1960 governing this subject. The net sales proceeds after tax of real estate belonging to foreign nationals are transferable, subject to the prior approval of the Central Bank. Nonresident-owned capital that is not permitted to be transferred abroad is credited to blocked accounts (see sec- tion on Nonresident Accounts, above). Residents require the prior approval of the Central Bank to borrow funds abroad.

The Cen- tral Bank has a monopoly over the import of unworked gold. It sells bars to domestic goldsmiths in limited quantities, to meet genuine commercial needs, at prices announced from time to time; at the end of 1973 this price was LD 1,302 a kilogram. Provided that a license is obtained from the Minis- try of Economy, goldsmiths may have such gold processed abroad, after which it must be reimported. Bars purchased from the Central Bank must be melted and processed before they can be sold to the public. Exports of unworked gold not for processing are not permitted unless made by or on behalf of the Government. Unworked gold is subject to an import du ty of 15 per cent. Changes during 1973 February 16. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the Libyan Arab Republic main- tained its par value in terms of gold.

The un it of currency is the Malagasy Franc, which is officially maintained at the rate of FMG 1 = 0.02 French franc. Exchange transactions in French francs, l the intervention currency, between the Cen- tral Bank of the Malagasy Republic and commercial banks take place at the rates of FMG 50.25 selling, and FMG 49.75 buying, per F 1. The Central Bank quotes seven other curren- cies. 2 The authorized banks are not permitted to maintain an exchange position in any foreign currency. All countries other than the Malagasy Republic itself are considered foreign countries, and financial relations w i th all foreign countries are subject to exchange control. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Office of External Finance of the Directorate of the Treasury in the M in is try of Economy and Finance, which also supervises borrowing and lending abroad by residents, the issue, sale, or introduction of foreign securities in the Malagasy Republic, all outward investments, and inward direct investment. Some of the ex- change control approval au thor i ty has been delegated to the authorized banks. All exchange transactions relating to for- eign countries must be effected through authorized banks. Import licenses are issued by the Foreign Trade Bureau of the Directorate of Commerce and Prices in the M in is try of Econ- omy and Finance, including those for gold. Export authoriza- tions are issued either by the Foreign Trade Bureau (and its provincial offices) or by other specified public agencies, ma in ly stabilization funds or marke t ing offices for agricul- tural products. Prescription of Currency Payments and receipts must be effected through the autho- rized banks, which may deal w i th the Central Bank of the Malagasy Republic only in the currencies quoted by the lat- ter. Nonresident Accounts The principal type of nonresident account is Foreign Ac- counts in Malagasy Francs; these accounts may be debited and credited only for transactions between nonresidents and for explicitly authorized transactions between residents and nonresidents. When Malagasy francs accruing to a nonresi- dent are not immediately eligible for credit to a Foreign Ac- count, they must be credited to a Special Account, balances in which may be used by the holder for personal expenses in the Malagasy Republic, subject to a limit of FMG 10,000 a day during a period not exceeding 30 days. 1 The Central Bank of the Malagasy Republic deals solely in official French francs. Commercial banks requiring financial French francs must acquire them on the French exchange market or th rough arb i trage abroad. 2 These currencies are listed as Belgian francs, deutsche m a rk, I ta l ian lire, Ne ther lands guilders, pounds s ter l ing, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. All imports are subject to import licensing; the import of certain other items from all sources is prohibited or sus- pended until fur ther notice. Imports of fru it juices are conditional on purchases of domestic f ru it juices (jumelage). Imports of household soap are, in principle, conditional on purchases of household soap from Ivory Coast. Imports are effected w i th in the framework of an annual import program. The import program is based on the estab- lishment of global quotas that set the limits up to which specified commodities may be imported. All import transactions valued at FMG 10,000 or more must be domiciled with an authorized bank. The import li- cense entitles importers to purchase the necessary exchange (up to eight days before shipment when a documentary credit is opened); the payment can be made when the shipping documents are submitted to the authorized bank. Payments for Invisibles Most payments for invisibles require the prior approval of the Ministry of Economy and Finance. For some types of transactions the approval au thor i ty has been delegated to authorized banks, either up to specified limits or for any amount that is properly documented. Residents may obtain an exchange allocation for tourism equivalent to FMG 75,000 a person a trip, for up to two trips a year (FMG 35,000 for children under ten); any foreign exchange remaining after return to the Malagasy Republic must be surrendered. There also is an exchange allocation for business travel up to the equivalent of FMG 10,000 a person a day, subject to a maxi- mum of FMG 200,000 a person a trip, for any number of trips a year. Authorized banks may not make available foreign banknotes in excess of the equivalent of FMG 20,000 a person a trip for tourist or business travel. Applications for amounts in excess of the basic tourist and business travel allocations, and applications for exchange for any other type of travel, must be submitted to the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Allocations for different types of travel may not be combined. The transfer of savings from wages and salaries earned by a foreigner working in the Malagasy Republic is permitted, upon presentation of his employment contract and provided that the transfer takes place within three months of the pay period, up to 25 per cent of the net salary for bachelors and persons having their family in the Malagasy Republic, and up to 45 per cent for those whose fam i ly lives outside the Mala- gasy Republic (100 per cent for all concerned during leave spent outside the Malagasy Republic).

Export proceeds received in foreign currencies must be surrendered; such export proceeds normally must become due not later than one month after arrival of the goods at their destination. All export transactions valued at FMG 50,000 or more must be domiciled with an authorized bank and a com- m i tment to repatriate the proceeds must be signed.

Borrowing abroad by physical or juridical persons, whether public or private persons, requires prior authoriza- tion by the Minister of Economy and Finance. However, loans contracted by registered banks or credit institutions with special legal status are exempt from approval. Lending abroad is subject to exchange control authorization and is restricted. In accordance with the Investment Code of September 19, 1973, foreign or domestic enterprises of special interest for the economy may be granted preferential treatment in accor- dance w i th an "order of approval" (arrete d'agrement). Such enterprises may benefit from specified advantages relating to import and export duties, income taxes, supplementary allo- cations above those allotted in the annual import program, the introduction of quotas for competing imports, etc. The same benefits may be granted temporarily to investments not qua l ify ing for an "order of approval." Exceptional treatment beyond the benefits provided for by the Investment Code and other existing legislation may be granted in a participation contract (control de participation). Capital Gold Capital movements between the Malagasy Republic and foreign countries and between residents and nonresidents are subject to exchange control; capital transfers to all countries require exchange control approval, but capital receipts from foreign countries normally are permitted freely. Special controls (additional to any exchange control re- quirements that may be applicable) are maintained over bor- rowing abroad, over inward direct investment and all outward investment, and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in the Malagasy Repub- lic. Foreign direct investments in the Malagasy Republic, 3 and Malagasy direct investments abroad, 4 require prior ap- proval of the Minister of Economy and Finance (i.e., the Directorate of the Treasury in the Ministry). The total or partial liquidation of such investments must be declared to the Minister. Both the making and the liquidation of direct investments, whether these are Malagasy investments abroad or foreign investments in the Malagasy Republic, must be reported to the Minister of Economy and Finance within 20 days following each operation. Mere participation is not con- sidered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 per cent in the capital of a company. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign secu- rities in the Malagasy Republic requires prior authorization by the Minister of Economy and Finance.

Central Bank Instruction No. 2-SE instructed authorized banks w i th effect from August 13 to deal solely with the Central Bank for their spot transactions in currencies quoted by the Central Bank (which were listed as Belgian francs, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Nether- lands guilders, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, and U.S. dol- lars). Banks were required to cover daily w i th the Central Bank their net position in each quoted currency. Arbitrage transactions abroad in quoted currencies, or compensation between authorized banks, were prohibited. The Central Bank introduced buying and selling rates for the quoted cur- rencies. The rates that banks could charge their customers were those published by the Central Bank and could not include any exchange commission or transfer commission. Banks were prohibited f rom incurring a spot exchange po- sition in any foreign currency. Subject to certain conditions, however, they could run a positive or negative forward posi- tion in French francs in respect of Malagasy exports or im- ports. Banks could not cover spot w i th the Central Bank any forward exchange transactions of their customers. August 17. Ordinance No. 73-047 revised the customs ta r i f f. August 24. Decree No. 73-240 made imports of all com- modities, irrespective of origin, subject to import licensing w i th in the framework of annual or semiannual quotas. Previ- ously, most imports originating in countries of the French Franc Area or member countries of the EEC were exempt from license. Notices to Importers Nos. 1012, 1013, and 1014 of August 27 specified the application of this decree. The decree also regulated exports. August 27.

Circular No. 30409 set out the procedures for the implementation of Order No. 3393, including provisions for opening Special Accounts with the Banque Nationale Malgache de Developpement. 283 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MALAWI Exchange Rate System The par value is 1.06641 grams of f ine gold per Malawi Kwacha, corresponding to MK 0.833333 = SDR 1. How- ever, no exchange transactions take place at the par value. The Reserve Bank of Malawi sets daily buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar and the pound sterling in light of exchange market developments abroad. On December 31, 1973 the Reserve Bank's buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were MK 1 = US$0.8433 and MK 1 = US$0.8391, respectively, and those for sterling were MK 1 = £0.5106 and MK 1 = £0.5128, respectively. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Reserve Bank of Malawi under powers delegated to it by the Minister of Fi- nance. Much of the authority for approving normal current payments is in turn delegated to commercial banks desig- nated as authorized dealers. Import policy is formulated by the Minister of Trade and Indus try, subject to the approval of the Cabinet. The Minister is also responsible for the issue of import and export licenses. Prescription of Currency Malawi has ceased to be a Scheduled Territory in terms of the U.K. Exchange Control Act, 1947 but under current U.K. exchange control regulations continues to be regarded as a country of the Overseas Sterling Area. For prescription of currency purposes, a distinction is made between the rest of the Sterling Area (the Nonresident Scheduled Area) and all other countries except Rhodesia (the External Account Area). * Settlements w i th residents of other countries in the Sterling Area may be made in Malawi kwacha through a Nonresident Scheduled Area Account, in sterling, or in any other Sterling Area currency. Payments to residents of countries outside the Sterling Area other than Rhodesia may be made in sterling or in Malawi kwacha to the credit of an External Account, or in any non-Sterling Area currency other than Rhodesian currency. Payments from residents of countries outside the Sterling Area except Rhodesia may be received in sterling or in Malawi kwacha from an External Account, or in any non-Sterling Area currency freely ex- changeable for sterling. Special regulations apply to settle- ments w i th Rhodesia. Nonresident Accounts Accounts in Malawi kwacha held by residents of other parts of the Sterling Area are designated Nonresident Sched- uled Area Accounts. These accounts may be credited w i th the proceeds from sales of any Sterling Area currency, with au- thorized payments to Sterling Area countries by residents, and w i th transfers from other Nonresident Scheduled Area Accounts. Balances on these accounts may be converted 1 Under Malawi's exchange control regulations, all currencies o ther than the Malawi kwacha (or any other currency that may be legal tender in Malawi) are considered foreign currencies. 284 freely into other Sterling Area currencies, may be used to make payments to residents of Malawi for any purpose, and may be transferred freely to other Nonresident Scheduled Area Accounts; these accounts may also be debited for pay- ments to the account holder while temporarily resident in Malawi. Transfers to External Accounts require specific ap- proval. Accounts in Malawi kwacha held with authorized banks by residents of countries outside the Sterling Area other than Rhodesia are designated External Accounts. These accounts may be credited with authorized payments by residents to countries outside the Sterling Area except Rhodesia, with transfers from other External Accounts held in Malawi or any other Sterling Area territory, with individually approved transfers from Nonresident Scheduled Area Accounts, and w i th the proceeds from sales of any non-Sterling Area cur- rency except Rhodesian currency by nonresidents to autho- rized dealers. They may be debited for payments for any purpose to residents of Malawi and of any other country of the Sterling Area, for transfers to other External Accounts held in Malawi or any other Sterling Area territory, or to Nonresident Scheduled Area Accounts in Malawi, and for purchases of any Sterling Area or non-Sterling Area currency other than Rhodesian currency from authorized dealers; they may also be debited for withdrawals by the account holder while temporarily staying in Malawi. External Accounts—Rhodesia arc accounts in Malawi kwa- cha that are held by persons regarded as residents of Rhode- sia. They may only be credited w i th (1) the proceeds from the sale of Rhodesian currency to an authorized dealer in Malawi, and (2) transfers from another Rhodesian External Account. The accounts may be debited with (1) payments to residents of Malawi for any purpose; (2) payments to the account holder while temporarily staying in Malawi; (3) transfers to another Rhodesian External Account; and (4) transfers to the account holders in Rhodesia. Blocked Accounts in Malawi kwacha held with authorized banks by residents of any country other than Malawi are credited with nontransferable capital sums in Malawi cur- rency which have accrued to nonresidents. All debits and credits to such accounts require the prior approval of the exchange control authorities. Normally, approval is given for the investment of balances of Blocked Accounts in Malawian securities, provided that these are held in Malawi to the order of an authorized dealer. The interest on Blocked Account balances is freely transferable to the account holder's country of residence. Imports and Import Payments The statutory basis of the principal import restrictions is the Control of Goods Act, which authorizes the Minister of Trade and Indus t ry to control and regulate the import, ex- port, distribution, disposal, purchase, sale, wholesale price, and retail price of any goods. It also has provisions which, when brought in to operation, will require all importers and exporters to be registered. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution The import from Rhodesia of asbestos, iron ore, pig iron, chrome, tobacco, copper, and hides and skins is prohibited. For a number of i tems ,2 import licenses are required regard- less of the country of origin. All other goods may be imported under an open general license when originating in Common- wealth countries or in non-Commonwealth countries that are members of the GATT. Imports originating in the Republic of China are treated similarly but require an individual li- cense. With respect to other countries, an import license is required for all commodities except certain items such as petroleum products, exposed cinematographic films, bona fide unsolicited gifts not exceeding MK 50 in value, samples, and advertising materials. Payments for imports from all countries must be made within six months after the date of import. Foreign exchange for these payments is automatically granted by the authorized dealers, subject only to the presentation of relevant docu- ments and compliance with import licensing requirements. Any transfer of funds in anticipation of imports is prohibited, except with the permission of the exchange control authori- ties. Advance payments may, however, be made for imports valued at up to MK 100 on presentation of an invoice or other evidence indicating that the seller requires payment in ad- vance. Imports from any Sterling Area country may be paid for in Malawi currency to a local Nonresident Scheduled Area Account, in sterling, or in any other Sterling Area currency. Imports from other areas, except Rhodesia, may be paid for in Malawi currency to a local External Account, in sterling to an External Account held elsewhere in the Sterling Area, or in any non-Sterling Area currency. A surtax of 10 per cent is levied on most goods imported into Malawi, irrespective of their origin; the surtax is calcu- lated on 120 per cent of the sum of the value for customs du ty purposes and any customs du ty payable. Payments for Invisibles Exchange to pay for invisibles related to imports, and also, up to certain limits, for other purposes, such as travel, is provided by the authorized dealers without prior reference to the exchange control authorities. The basic exchange allow- ance for travel is MK 20 a day for an adult, w i th a maximum of MK 600 a calendar year, and MK 10 a day for each child under 18 years of age, with a maximum of MK 300 a calendar year for children between 10 and 18, and of MK 200 a year for children under 10. The annual allowance is not cumulative but may be increased by up to 50 per cent if the traveler has not applied for a travel allowance during the preceding three years. These allocations are subject to a combined maximum of MK 2,000 a year for a family traveling together. Exchange is provided, subject to certain limits, for other purposes, such as education, medical treatment, family remittances, and business travel. Applications for amounts exceeding the stan- 2 Certain agricultural and food products, new (military type) and used clothing, gold, sugar, wheat flour, cement, fertilizers, newsprint and certain paper products, pencils, ball-point pens, office stapling machines and staples, printing inks, erasers, hand-operated numbering stamps, flick knives, explo- sives, arms and ammun i t ion, game traps, mist nets, wild animals, live fish, cassava, and copyright articles. MALAWI dard allocations may be submitted to the exchange control authorities. Foreign nationals employed in Malawi on con- tracts or holding a temporary employment permit are allowed to remit up to two thirds of their current net earnings to their coun try of normal residence. Travelers may take out up to MK 20 in Malawi currency and the equivalent of MK 20 in foreign currency in addition to their basic travel allowance. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of goods of any description that exceed MK 100 in value are prohibited, unless the Controller of Customs and Excise is satisfied that payment has been made or will be made in an appropriate manner to a resident of Malawi not later than six months after the date of exportation. Certain commodities 3 are subject to export licensing, mainly to en- sure the adequacy of their domestic supplies. Export proceeds in foreign currency must be sold to an authorized dealer. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in any foreign currency must be offered for sale to an authorized dealer. There is no limitation on the amount of foreign currency notes and coins that may be imported by travelers, but not more than MK 20 in Ma- lawi currency notes and coins may be imported. The import of currency notes and coins of the former Federation of Rho- desia and Nyasaland is prohibited. Capital Inward transfers of capital are not restricted, with the ex- ception that the taking up of loans from abroad by residents requires prior exchange control approval. This is normally granted, provided that the terms of repayment are realistic. Outward transfers of capital, including those to other parts of the Sterling Area, are controlled, but nonresidents are permitted to repatriate their investments when they have sat- isfied the authorities that the original investment was made with funds brought into the country from sources outside Malawi; there are no restrictions on the transfer abroad of dividends and profits of foreign-owned companies, provided that no recourse is being made to local borrowing. In general, residents are not permitted to transfer capital abroad and, w i th certain exceptions, are required to offer for sale to an authorized dealer any foreign exchange which ac- crues to them. However, residents may purchase foreign secu- rities (except bearer securities) quoted on recognized stock exchanges in the Sterling Area, provided that the securities so acquired are registered in the names of specified nominees and held to the order of an authorized dealer, and that in the event of subsequent disposal of these securities the sales proceeds are permitted to be repatriated by the exchange control au- 3 Implements of war, petroleum products, nickel, atomic energy materials, and certain agricultural and an imal products. 285 ©International Monetary Fund.

All income earned from these investments must be repatriated, and the corresponding foreign exchange must be sold to an authorized dealer. Emigrants are granted exchange as follows: (1) Persons 50 years of age and over are allowed exchange up to MK 15,000 whether single or married. (2) Married persons who have not reached the age of 50 are allowed MK 6,000 on departure, together w i th MK 500 for each child, up to a maximum of MK 8,000 for a family. (3) Unmarried persons who have not reached 50 years of age are allowed MK 3,000 on departure. (4) The balance of the emigrant's funds is blocked, but he is permitted to transfer to his new country of residence a sum equal to the original emigration allowance on each anni- versary of his departure from Malawi, up to a maximum of MK 8,000. Applications for emigrants' allowances, whether initial or subsequent, must be submitted to the exchange control authorities for approval. Residents require prior approval to lend to nonresidents or to resident firms controlled directly or indirectly from outside Malawi. Approval to lend to nonresident-controlled f irms may be withheld if it is felt that excessive recourse is being had to local borrowing, and that the firms have brought in in su f f i- cient working capital from abroad. Gold Residents of Malawi may purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in Malawi for numismatic purposes. With this excep- tion, residents other than the monetary authorities and autho- rized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Imports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Minister of Trade and Indus try in consultation with the Ministry of Finance; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. Changes during 1973 February 17. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the kwacha remained pegged to sterling at the existing ratio of MK 1 = £0.5. November 19. Malawi ceased to maintain a fixed exchange rate relationship between the kwacha and the pound sterling. The value of the kwacha would un t il fu r ther notice be deter- mined daily by the Reserve Bank of Malawi on the basis of changes in the sterling and U.S. dollar rates and at rates consistent therewith in respect of the currencies of Malawi's other major trad ing partners. 286 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MALAYSIA Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.290299 gram of fine gold per Malaysian Dollar, corresponding to MS3.06122 = SDR 1, and Malay- sia avails itself of wider margins. Since June 21, 1973, how- ever, the authorities have not maintained the exchange rate within announced margins, and therefore all transactions take place at a fluctuating exchange rate. The closing buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar in the Malaysian foreign exchange market on December 31, 1973 were MS2.4525 and MS2.4545 per US$1, respectively. The commercial banks are free to determine and quote exchange rates for all currencies to customers and are permitted to deal forward in all curren- cies. Malaysia formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from Novem- ber 11, 1968. Administration of Control The Central Bank of Malaysia administers exchange con- trol on behalf of the Malaysian Government throughout Ma- laysia, the Governor of the Bank being the Controller of Foreign Exchange. Much of the authority for approving nor- mal current payments is delegated to commercial banks au- thorized for this purpose. The authority for import control rests with the Central Government. The day-to-day adminis- tration of import control throughout Malaysia is carried out jointly by the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Royal Customs and Excise. 1 Certain import and export transac- tions are effected by a state trading corporation, the National Trading Corporation (PERNAS). Prescription of Currency Malaysia has ceased to be a Scheduled Territory in terms of the U.K. Exchange Control Act, 1947 but under current U.K. exchange control regulations continues to be regarded as a country of the Overseas Sterling Area. All payments to countries other than Rhodesia and South Africa may be made either in Malaysian dollars through an External Account, or in any currency other than Rhodesian and South African currencies. Receipts from exports to countries other than Rhodesia and South Africa must be obtained, within six months from the date of exportation, either in Malaysian dollars obtained from the sale of a specified currency to a bank in Malaysia, or in any specified currency. Special regula- tions apply to settlements with Rhodesia and South Africa. Nonresident Accounts The accounts in Malaysian dollars of residents of countries other than Malaysia are treated as nonresident accounts and, unless specially restricted, are designated External Accounts. There are no restrictions on debits to External Accounts. Credits to these accounts for whatever purpose are freely 1 There are at present f ive separate customs areas: West Malaysia, excluding Penang; Sabah, excluding Labuan; Sarawak; Penang; and Labuan. Labuan and Penang are free ports. permitted subject only to the completion of exchange control forms for amounts above M$ 1,000; the proceeds from the sale of any foreign currency may be credited to External Ac- counts. For amounts exceeding M$ 1,000 and up to M$l million, permission may be given by commercial banks; above M$l million, permission is given by the Controller of Foreign Exchange. Balances on External Accounts may be transferred to any other account, whether resident or nonresident, and may be converted into any currency except Rhodesian and South African currencies. Accounts of residents of Rhodesia and South Africa are designated as Rhodesian Accounts and South African Accounts, respectively. All debits and credits to such accounts require prior approval. Imports and Import Payments Tariffs and import controls of the various parts of Malaysia have not yet been fully unified, although steps toward unifica- tion are being taken. Some internal tar iffs and other trade restrictions still exist between parts of Malaysia. Most im- ports are permitted freely under open general license. De- pending on the nature and origin of the goods, specific licenses are required for certain imports for health, security, or moral reasons; various conditions must be satisfied before licenses for such goods are issued. Certain other imports are subject to quantitative restrictions pending the introduction of protective customs duties to protect local industries. Imports into all parts of Malaysia of all commodities from South Africa, Rhodesia, or any territory administered by either are prohibited. Imports into all parts of Malaysia of all commodities from the People's Republic of China are prohib- ited except under specific license. Imports into all parts of Malaysia of all commodities from Eastern Germany and North Korea also require specific licenses. Imports into West Malaysia of primates from all sources, including East Malay- sia, are prohibited except under specific license; imports of bones, bone meal, and other live animals (except sheep and goats) from Brunei, Burma, Indonesia, the Khmer Republic, Laos, Thailand, and Viet-Nam also require a specific license. Imports into Sarawak of sulphur, certain chemicals, and live sheep and goats from all sources, including West Malaysia and Sabah, are prohibited, except under specific license. Im- ports of motor vehicles and certain types of textiles into East Malaysia are also subject to specific import licensing. In re- spect of West Malaysia, imports of rice from any country are conditional on the importer purchasing one ton of rice from the government reserve stockpile for every ton imported; 2 imports of wheat flour, rice bran, and sugar 3 from all sources are subject to quantitative restrictions for protective reasons; licenses for wheat flour are not being issued. Other goods subject to quantitative restriction in West Malaysia include rolled oats, certain cotton fabrics, jute, and fully assembled motor vehicles. Certain imports are effected by PERNAS, which has a monopoly over imports from the People's Repub- 2 This ratio is varied from time to time depending on the turnover of official stocks. 3 Including jaggery, rock sugar, and molasses listed under specified tariff numbers. 287 ©International Monetary Fund.

Virtually all imports into Malaysia (including Penang but excluding Labuan) are subject to a surtax of 4 per cent ad valorem, unless they are re-exported ex-bond; a drawback may be granted on goods intended for re-export or for export after processing. In addition, most imports in to Malaysia (excluding Penang and Labuan) are subject to a sales tax; the standard rate of tax is 5 per cent ad valorem, but certain luxu ry goods are subject to a rate of 10 per cent ad valorem. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to all countries other than Rhode- sia and South Africa may be made freely after exchange con- trol requirements have been met. There are no restrictions on the amount of foreign exchange made available for travel abroad. Remittances to nonresidents of dividends, interest, and profits on all bona fide investments are freely permitted, subject only to the completion of exchange control forms for amounts in excess of M$ 1,000. Unless special permission is obtained, not more than M$ 1,000 in Malaysian notes and the equivalent of M$ 1,000 in foreign notes may be taken out of Malaysia by travelers. Nonresident travelers are allowed to take out foreign currency notes up to the amount declared upon en try. Exports and Export Proceeds The three territories of Malaysia (West Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak) at present maintain separate export control systems, a l though the Federal Government retains the right to legislate in respect of exports from any Malaysian territory. Exchange control forms have to be completed and authorized by banks in Malaysia for exports valued at M$5,000 or more. 4 Proceeds from exports must be received w i th in six mon ths of shipment either in a specified currency or in Ma- laysian dollars obtained from the sale of a specified currency to a bank in Malaysia. Exports of rubber from West Malaysia require a certificate issued by the Malaysian Rubber Ex- change. Exports of rubber and tin to South Africa and any territory administered by South Africa are prohibited, as are exports of sugar to any destination. All exports to Rhodesia and any territory administered by Rhodesia are also prohib- ited. Proceeds from Invisibles The exchange control requirements governing exchange receipts from invisibles are, in general, the same as those for export proceeds. Travelers may bring in up to M$ 1,000 in Malaysian currency notes; otherwise, permission is required for the import of Malaysian notes. No limitations are im- posed on the import by travelers of currency notes of other countries. 4 In the case of exports to Indonesia, in excess of M$ 100,000. 288 Capital Inward portfolio and direct investment in Malaysia may be made w i thout app rova l .5 However, nonresidents making di- rect investment and the registrars of companies are responsi- ble for ensuring that the conditions of the Ministry of Trade and Indus t ry with respect to capital participation are com- plied w i th. The proceeds of investments may be repatriated freely on resale, subject to the completion of exchange control forms for amounts above M$ 1,000. Malaysian residents re- qu ire approval for borrowings from nonresidents in either Malaysian dollars or in foreign currencies. Companies in Ma- laysia controlled by nonresidents are permitted to borrow in Malaysia up to M$500,000 without exchange control ap- proval. The permission of the Controller of Foreign Exchange is freely given for direct and portfolio investment by Malay- sian residents in countries other than Rhodesia and South Africa. Gold Residents other than authorized dealers in gold are not permitted to purchase, hold, or sell gold in any form other than gold that has been materially increased in value by skilled craftsmanship. The manufacture, import, or export of gold coins is prohibited, as is domestic trading in gold coins other than the M$100 gold coin of Malaysian currency and the SS150 gold coin of Singapore currency. Resident and nonresident travelers, however, may freely bring in or take out, on their person, one MS100 gold coin. In addition, each traveler is allowed to bring in from any country outside Ma- laysia one S$150 gold coin issued by the Singapore Board of Commissioners of Currency, and each traveler may take out one such coin, but only to Singapore. Licensed goldsmiths are permitted by the exchange control authorities to purchase certain quantities of gold from an authorized dealer at local free market prices for the manufacture of bona fide jewelry and ornaments. Furthermore, producers of gold are permit- ted to sell their ou tput at local free market prices to autho- rized dealers in gold. Imports of gold are restricted under the Customs Act, 1967, and require licenses from the Ministry of Trade and Indus try. Permission for imports of gold in any form other than jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler is not normally given except for imports by authorized dealers in gold to meet the genuine requirements of goldsmiths for manufac tur ing jewelry and ornaments and for industrial use. Imports are allocated to authorized dealers in gold by means of a tender system; successful tenderers must pay a premium to the Government. Imports are subject to a 2 per cent import du ty and a 4 per cent surtax, 6 as well as a sales tax of 10 per cent ad valorem. Domestic transactions in gold or gold orna- ments are subject only to the sales tax, at 10 per cent ad valorem. Exports of gold in any form other than jewelry 5 However, w i th effect f rom February 20, 1974 the Government introduced regulations to control foreign take-overs, mergers, and acquisitions of Malaysian companies and businesses.

Not for Redistribution constituting the personal effects of a traveler are prohibited under the exchange control regulations. Changes during 1973 February 1. Imports of certain types of chemicals, synthetic fibers, woven fabrics of wool and man-made yarn, and certain mechanical appliances became subject to licensing. February 13. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Malaysia decided to maintain the existing gold parity of the Malaysian dollar. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously MS2.81955 = US$1, became MS2.53760 = US$1. May 8. Under the Exchange Control Act, 1953, the Sched- uled Territories were redefined to comprise Malaysia only. The distinction between Sterling Area and non-Sterling Area countries in the exchange control regulations was thereby discontinued and exchange controls were extended to Sterling Area countries. The prescription of currency regulations and nonresident account arrangements were changed accord- ingly. Simultaneously, the approval authority delegated to authorized banks was broadened (see below). It was an- nounced that the existing regulations on exchange transac- tions w i th non-Sterling Area countries would be liberalized to the max imum extent possible, and that residents would be freely permitted to remit funds for the purpose of direct and portfolio investment in all countries. (Previously, there were restrictions on capital outflows to countries outside the Ster- ling Area only; there were no restrictions on current pay- ments.) May 8. Remittances abroad were permitted freely w i thout limit. Remittances of M$ 1,000 or less did not require ap- proval. Remittances in excess of M$ 1,000 and up to M$l million could be approved by commercial banks. Amounts in excess of M$l million required the approval of the Controller of Foreign Exchange, which was given freely for all purposes. The following basic allocations for transactions w i th countries outside the Sterling Area lapsed: the tourist travel allowance of M$5,000 a person a calendar year; the business travel allowance of M$200 a day; the settling-in allowance for emigrants of M$50,000 for each family un i t; the cash gift allowance of M$2,500 a year per donor or remittor; and the education allowance of M$ 15,000 a student a year. May 8. Residents were freely permitted to make direct and portfolio investments abroad. Remittances up to M$l million could be approved by commercial banks; amounts in excess of M$l million required the approval of the Controller of Foreign Exchange. Inward portfolio and direct investment was exempted from exchange control approval. Nonresidents making direct investments were required to comply w i th con- ditions laid down by the Ministry of Trade and Indus t ry w i th respect to capital participation. May 8. All export proceeds henceforth had to be received either in specified currencies or in Malaysian dollars obtained from the sale of specified currencies to banks in Malaysia; previously this provision was applicable only to exports to non-Sterling Area countries. May 8. Portuguese escudos and Spanish pesetas were de- leted from the list of specified currencies. Australian dollars, MALAYSIA Brunei dollars, Hong Kong dollars, New Zealand dollars, pounds sterling, and Singapore dollars were added to it. May 8. Existing Sterling Area Accounts were redesignated External Accounts. May 8. Prepayments and deferred payments for goods im- ported from outside the Sterling Area henceforth were freely permitted, subject only to the completion of exchange control forms for amounts exceeding M$ 1,000. May 8. The rules governing the opening and maintenance of intercompany accounts with offices in countries outside the Sterling Area, except Rhodesia, were liberalized. May 8. Permission would henceforth be given freely for residents to operate foreign currency accounts in banks out- side Malaysia. Previously, residents were not permitted to operate any account outside the Sterling Area without ex- change control approval, and such approval was given re- strictively. May 8. All nonresident controlled companies in Malaysia required exchange control approval to borrow in Malaysia in excess of M$500,000. Previously, all local borrowings by companies controlled by residents of non-Sterling Area countries required approval. May 8. The limitations on Indonesian and Indian currency notes which could be brought into Malaysia by travelers (Rp 3,000 and Rs 270 a person) were removed. Henceforth, currency notes of any country could be brought in without limit. Furthermore, permission was no longer required for the import of Indonesian and Indian currency notes. May 8. The restriction on fam i ly remittances to the Peo- ple's Republic of China to M$45 a month a family was abol- ished, and such remittances henceforth could be made through banks. May 8. A recording system was introduced under which an exchange control form had to be completed for each remit- tance above M$ 1,000. May 8. Malaysia terminated the currency interchangeabil- ity arrangements with Singapore. The Central Bank of Ma- laysia continued to accept Singapore dollars until August 7, at prevailing market rates. May 8. Malaysia announced its decision to set up a separate stock exchange for Malaysia. The market would remain closed un t il May 13, after which the trading rooms in Malay- sia and Singapore would operate independently. May 8. Restrictions were formally applied to the making of payments and transfers between residents of Malaysia and residents of South Africa and on exports to South Africa; they were identical with the restrictions applicable to Rhodesia. (On March 12, 1974, similar restrictions were applied to Israel.) May 8. The following were revoked: the Exchange Control (Specified Currency) (General) Order, 1966; the Exchange Control (Regulation of Payments) (General) Order, 1967; the Exchange Control (Regulation of Payments) (General) (Amendment) Order, 1968; the Exchange Control (Import and Export) (General) Order, 1971; the Exchange Control (Prescribed Securities) Order, 1966; the Remittance Shops Permits (Condition of Grant) Notification, 1966; and the Exchange Control (Deposit of Securities) (Exemption) Order, 1966. 289 ©International Monetary Fund.

Not for Redistribution MALI Exchange Rate System No par value for the currency of Mali has been established with the Fund. The official unit of currency is the Mali Franc, which is officially maintained at the rate of MF 1 = 0 . 01 French franc. There is also a fixed rate of MF 2 for CFA francs. Mali operates a dual exchange m a r k e tl for transactions with foreign countries, i.e., countries other than France (in- cluding its Overseas Departments and Territories except the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries. 2 Transactions for the follow- ing take place at exchange rates based on those ruling in the official exchange market in Paris: imports, exports, and most other current transactions, as well as all current payments by or in favor of domestic and foreign public authorities and public bodies. All other settlements with foreign countries as well as transactions in domestic and foreign banknotes take place at rates based on those ruling in the financial franc market in Paris. The principal current payments and receipts channeled through the financial franc market are those relat- ing to travel expenses, capital earnings, and workers' remit- tances. Administration of Control The Minister of Finance has sole authority in exchange control matters; certain exchange control powers have been delegated to authorized banks. The bilateral payments agree- ments are operated by the Development Bank of Mali. Li- censes for imports and exports are issued by the Directorate-General of Economic Affa irs in the Ministry of Finance. Exchange control is applicable only to foreign countries. Prescription of Currency Settlements on account of transactions covered by bilateral payments arrangements are made in currencies and through accounts established under such agreements. Bilateral ac- counts are maintained with the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Egypt, Hungary, Mo- rocco, Poland, Romania, Senegal, the U.S.S.R., and North V ie t -Nam .3 Mali is an Operations Account country of the French Franc Area, since its Central Bank maintains an Operations Account with the French Treasury; settlements w i th France (as defined above), Monaco, and the other Operations Ac- count countries of the French Franc Area are made in Mali francs, French francs, or the currency of any other Operations Account country.

Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are, in principle, based on those applied in France. Imports and Import Payments Imports of a few commodities are prohibited for health, safety, and similar reasons, and licenses are not normally issued for certain other goods. Imports of all other goods, irrespective of origin, require individual licenses, and imports from foreign countries must be domiciled w i th an authorized bank. Imports are licensed in accordance with an annual import program drawn up by the Malian authorities and subject to approval by a joint French-Malian Committee. The program consists of two parts: an allocation for clearing countries and one for the convertible area (defined as comprising all other countries, including the French Franc Area). Certain aid- financed imports are not included in the import program and do not require an import license. Imports may be made either by private importers or by state enterprises, among which the Societe Malienne de Tlmport-Export (SOMIEX) is by far the most important, hav- ing a monopoly over the import of a number of items. 4 All imports from and exports to countries that have payments agreements with Mali are made by SOMIEX or UNICOOP. An allocation commission establishes quotas for each pri- vate importer on the basis of his turnover and the number of his employees. Import licenses are issued to the private im- porter up to the limit of the quota accorded to him. In addi- tion, importers may w i th an import license import any goods under the EXIC (Exportation et Importation Concomitante) procedure. The authorized banks are permitted to make for- eign exchange available for all licensed imports. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above) and the other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to approval. Payments for invisibles related to trade are per- mitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been ap- proved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted freely. For tourist travel, residents traveling to countries other than France (as defined above) and the other Operations Account countries of the French Franc Area may obtain an exchange allocation of an amount equivalent to MF 150,000 a person, which may be taken up twice a year; any foreign exchange remaining after return to Mali must be surren- dered. For business travel, there is a special allocation of the equivalent of MF 40,000 a day, subject to a maximum 4 These include cement, cigarettes, f lou r, m i lk, salt, soap, sugar, and tea. 291 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MALI of MF 400,000 a t r ip .5 The transfer of the entire salary of a foreigner working in Mali is permitted upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher, provided that the transfer takes place within three months of the pay period. Resident travel- ers going to foreign countries may take out up to a max imum of MF 50,000 in Mali banknotes, French banknotes, and banknotes issued by other Operations Account countries (MF 5,000 for trips of less than 24 hours). Travelers to other countries of the French Franc Area may take out MF 250,000 in Mali banknotes. Nonresident travelers may take out foreign banknotes and coins up to the amount declared by them on en try or up to MF 150,000 if no declaration was made. They may also take out MF 50,000 in Mali banknotes and any payments instru- ments drawn up abroad in their name. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank, and export proceeds received in currencies other than those of France or another Operations Account country must be surrendered; export proceeds must normally be collected and repatriated within 90 days after the arrival of the goods at their destination. Exports require individual licenses in order to ensure the repatriation of export proceeds. The export of cotton, groundnuts, hides, skins, and meat, which constitute most of the controlled export trade, is re- served for SOMIEX or other public or mixed enterprises. Under the EXIC procedure, exporters may retain 75 per cent of proceeds from exports of commodities of the tradi- tional sector except those covered by the monopoly of state trading companies, for payment for their own imports that are made through regular official channels. Balances on EXIC accounts and import rights under the EXIC procedure are not transferable. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above) and other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets must be collected and surrendered. Resident and nonresident travel- ers may bring in any amount of banknotes and coins issued by the Central Bank of Mali, the Bank of France, or a bank of issue ma in ta in ing an Operations Account w i th the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign banknotes and 5 Exchange for tourist travel purposes is made available on ly to persons s u bm i t t i ng an exit permit (autorisation de sortie) issued by the Security Services. coins (except gold coins) of countries outside the French Franc Area. Capital Capital movements between Mali, France (as defined above), and other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area are free of exchange control; capital trans- fers to all other countries require exchange control approval and are restricted, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. Special controls (in addition to any exchange control re- quirements that may be applicable) are maintained over bor- rowing abroad; the Development Bank of Mali is exempt. The special control measures do not apply to relations with France (as defined above) or to countries whose bank of issue is linked w i th the French Treasury by an Operations Ac- count. Under an Investment Code of May 23, 1969 and Law No. 62 of January 15, 1962, the Government may grant special privileged status, providing for transfer, tax, and other prefer- ential treatment to foreign investments that would be of spe- cial interest to the Malian economy and that are compatible with the goals of the Economic Plan. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Mali for numismatic purposes and for ornaments. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Ministry of Finance; such licenses are not nor- mally granted. Changes during 1973 February 13. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the exchange rate of MF 1 = F 0.01 was maintained; the effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously MF 511.570 = US$1, became MF 460.414 = US$1. March 19. With the entry into effect of new margins ar- rangements between the French franc and certain other Euro- pean currencies, and the maintenance of the exchange rate of MF 1 == F 0.01, the Mali franc began to appreciate in terms of the U.S. dollar. July 1. The exchange control regulations applicable to for- eign countries became applicable also to the Malagasy Re- public.

Not for Redistribution MALTA Exchange Rate System The par value is 2.13281 grams of fine gold per Malta Pound, corresponding to £M 0.416667 = SDR 1. A central rate of 2.18613 grams of f ine gold per Malta pound has been established, corresponding to £M 0.406504 = SDR 1, and Malta avails itself of wider margins. As at the end of 1973, the prescribed margins were not, for the time being, being observed, and the Central Bank quoted daily rates for sterling based on developments in the principal exchange markets abroad. The Central Bank of Malta's basic rate for the pound sterling on December 31, 1973 was £ stg. 111.625 buying, and £ stg. 111.375 selling, per £M 100. Commercial bank rates for non-Sterling Area currencies are based on London market rates for sterling against other currencies. The banks' buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar on December 31, 1973 were US$2.5889 and US$2.5831 per £M 1. Administration of Control Exchange controls are administered by the Central Bank as agent for the Minister of Finance and Customs; trade controls are administered by the Director of Trade in the Ministry of Trade, Indus try, Agriculture, and Tourism. Certain authori- ties to approve applications for the allocation of foreign ex- change have been delegated to the authorized banks. Prescription of Currency Malta has ceased to be a Scheduled Territory in terms of the U.K. Exchange Control Act, 1947 but under current U.K. exchange control regulations continues to be regarded as a country of the Overseas Sterling Area. Authorized pay- ments to all countries may be made by crediting Malta pounds to an External Account or in any foreign currency, * the proceeds of exports to all countries may be received in Malta pounds from an External Account or in any foreign currency. Nonresident Accounts Residents of all countries outside Malta may maintain with authorized banks nonresident accounts in Malta pounds, des- ignated External Accounts. These accounts may be credited freely with authorized payments by nonresidents, with trans- fers from other External Accounts, w i th the proceeds from sales of gold or any foreign currency (including banknotes), and with Malta banknotes mailed from outside Malta. Exter- nal Accounts may be debited freely for payments to residents, for transfers to other External Accounts, for payments in cash in Malta, and for purchases of any foreign currency (including banknotes). Blocked Accounts are maintained for nonresidents of Malta for certain funds of a capital nature which, under the existing exchange control regulations, may not be transferred outside Malta. The principal type of funds that must be cred- ited to a Blocked Account are assets of emigrants in excess 1 Foreign currencies are defined as all currencies other than the Malta pound. of £M 5,000, for each family, that may be transferred to the new coun try of residence; the remaining funds are normally released four years after the date of departure on application to the Central Bank. Imports and Import Payments Imports of certain commodities manufactured in Malta are either prohibited or restricted. All imports from Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Hungary, North Korea, Poland, Rhodesia, Romania, the U.S.S.R., and North Viet-Nam are subject to specific licensing, as are im- ports of some 90 items from any country of origin. Imports from countries other than those mentioned that are not pro- hibited and do not require a specific license may be freely imported under open general license. Payments for all autho- rized imports may be made freely, provided that the prescrip- tion of currency regulations are complied with and that supporting documents, including the customs entry form, are submitted to the intermediary bank. Advance payments for imports may be made against the invoice if the goods are to arrive within six months but otherwise require Central Bank approval. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles in excess of £M 50 require the approval of the exchange control authorities; the approval authority has been delegated to authorized banks for certain types of payment. There is a standard exchange allocation for tourist travel of the equivalent of £M 250 a person a trip; a business travel allowance of £M 250 or £M 20 a day (for up to 30 days a trip), whichever is the larger; and an allowance for educational expenses abroad of £M 2,000 a person for an academic year. 2 Applications for allowances in excess of these amounts are approved by the Central Bank if the latter is satisfied that there is no illicit capital outflow involved. The transfer of genuine profits, dividends, and interest for ap- proved foreign investments requires Central Bank permis- sion, which is normally given, after compliance with certain formalities. Life insurance may not be contracted with insur- ers resident in non-Sterling Area countries. Maintenance re- mittances to beneficiaries abroad are allowed on application accompanied by documentary evidence of hardship; autho- rized banks may also approve moderate remittances for fam- ily living expenses. Travelers may export Malta banknotes and coins up to £M 25 for each person. Exports of foreign currencies may be made by resident travelers up to £M 250 for each person and by nonresident travelers up to the amount brought in. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of works of art and strategic war materials are prohibited and, with the exception of some 80 items that may 2 For purposes of exchange allocations for travel and study, residents are defined as physical persons who are at the time living in Malta in the normal course and either have so lived for at least three years or intend to continue so living for at least three years. 293 ©International Monetary Fund.

Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles must be offered for sale to an authorized bank. Travelers may bring in any amount in Malta and other currency notes. Capital No control is exercised over receipts. Receipts in foreign currencies must be offered for sale to an authorized bank, and payments of a capital na ture in such currencies require prior approval. Applications for outward direct investment by resi- dents of Malta and for direct investment in Malta by nonresi- dents are considered on their merits. The purchase of real estate in Malta by nonresidents through a resident procurator requires exchange control approval but is normally not re- stricted; such purchases by foreign nationals tak ing up per- manent residence in Malta after November 14, 1972 are restricted to the dwelling they live in. Purchases of all securi- ties issued outside Malta require prior permission from the authorities. However, permission is normally granted by the Central Bank for the acquisition of securities abroad up to the equivalent of £M 500 a person a calendar year (for persons over 18). Purchases of personal real estate situated outside Malta require prior exchange control approval and are not normally permitted to resident nationals. Foreign nationals who repatriate or take up residence out- side Malta normally are allowed to transfer all their assets to their new country of residence; in certain circumstances, how- ever, restrictions may be placed on foreign assets acquired, other than by way of income or capital appreciation, while the person has been resident in Malta. Maltese nationals who emigrate may transfer abroad up to £M 5,000 for each fam i ly; any excess amount is normally released four years after the date of departure on application to the Central Bank. Banks, other than those licensed to borrow and lend out- side Malta only, are restricted in the acquisition of net foreign assets. Gold Residents other than authorized banks and registered jew- elers are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than coins or jewelry, at home or abroad. Residents may freely purchase, sell, and hold any gold coins. Authorized dealers in gold are permitted to import gold coins for numis- matic purposes from virtually any country. A specific import license is required for imports of gold coins, gold bullion, and manufactured or semimanufactured articles of gold; imports of filigree work of gold or silver are prohibited. Authorized importers are permitted to import gold (bullion and coins) only for the purpose of disposing of it to jewelers and other industrial users. The export of gold by residents other than the monetary authorities requires the permission of the ex- change control authorities. Gold bullion and gold coins are free of import du ty. 294 Changes during 1973 During the year a number of items in addition to those specified below were added to the list of commodities requir- ing specific import licenses. January 30. The distribution began of four legal tender gold coins in denominations of £M 5, £M 10, £M 20, and £M 50. January 31. It was announced that a substantial degree of diversification of Malta's external reserves had been effected. February 1. The prohibition on outward portfolio invest- ment by resident private individuals was revoked. The Cen- tral Bank announced that it was prepared to approve all applications for the purchase of foreign exchange to be in- vested abroad w i th in the equivalent of £M 500 a person over 18 years of age a calendar year, provided these investments were du ly registered w i th the Central Bank. Holders of for- eign currency securities no longer required prior exchange control approval to switch these in to other foreign currency securities. Authorized dealers were empowered to approve such switches, as well as transfers and sales of foreign cur- rency securities and the investment abroad of income arising out of foreign investments already held. February 1. The Exchange Control Act, 1972 (Act. No. XL IX, enacted on December 27, 1972) came into force. It replaced the Exchange Control Ordinance, 1959. The Act designated all currencies other than the Malta pound as for- eign currencies, defined all persons not resident in Malta as nonresidents, and provided a new definition of "residents." Hence, all provisions of the law had global application. Thus, export proceeds received in Sterling Area currencies became subject to surrender requirements, and existing exchange al- locations for countries outside the Sterling Area became ap- plicable also to the Sterling Area. (Previously, a distinction was made between Scheduled Territories and the rest of the world; the Scheduled Territories under Malta's former ex- change control regulations were the territories of the Sterling Area, Rhodesia, and the Libyan Arab Republic, and foreign currencies were defined as all non-Sterling Area currencies). The Act also gave force of law to a previously existing administrative arrangement by prohibiting any restriction on payments in respect of (1) any sums realized from the sale or liquidation of any property in Malta acquired w i th funds originally brought from outside Malta and invested in such property by persons who were nonresidents at the time of the investment, and (2) any sums originally brought from outside Malta by a person who was not a citizen of Malta, when the payment was made upon such person leaving Malta to take up residence elsewhere. The Act introduced reporting requirements in respect of residents' foreign assets. Exempt were persons in Malta hold- ing a valid resident permit in terms of the Imm igra t ion Act, 1970. Such persons were also exempt from the requirement that residents obtain prior permission for all foreign invest- ment. February 1. Three commercial banks were appointed as authorized dealers.

A bill was introduced to empower the Minis- ter of Finance and Customs to act in accordance with the terms of international agreements entered into by Malta in respect of outward transfers of nonresident-owned capital invested in Malta. The resulting Exchange Control (Amend- ment) Act, 1973 was enacted on May 30 and came in to force on June 8 (see below). March 1. The Minister for Finance and Customs appointed the Central Bank, with effect from February 1, as his agent for purposes of the Exchange Control Act. March 20. Following the announcement that the U.S. dol- lar was being devalued and the reopening of major foreign exchange markets abroad, it was announced that the Malta pound would continue to float; its value would continue to be determined at a level between that of sterling and that of the currencies of the other major trading partners. June 8. Section 9 of the Exchange Control Act was amended. The amendment had the effect that exchange con- trol permission would not be withheld (except insofar as the w i thho ld ing of permission was necessary to give effect to an international agreement, treaty, or convention to which Malta is a party) for the repatriation of foreign capital in- vested in Malta by persons who were nonresidents at the time of the investment or of any sums brought in by noncitizens, when leaving Malta to take up residence elsewhere. July 23. The Development Loan Act, 1972 was amended so as to authorize the Government to borrow not only from foreign governments but also from international or foreign organizations, funds, or other institutions. October 1. Goods originating in the People's Republic of China were placed on the open general import license. 295 ©International Monetary Fund.

Ade facto fixed relationship is maintained w i th the French franc, the CFA franc issued by the BCEAO, and the Mali franc, at UM 1 = F 0.10, UM 1 = CFAF 5, and UM 1 = MF 10, respectively. 1 Exchange rates for currencies of countries out- side the French Franc Area are based on the fixed rate for the French franc and the rate of the currency concerned in the official exchange market in Paris. The Central Bank of Mauritania quotes daily buying and selling rates for 17 cur- rencies. 2 The same buy ing and selling rates are applied by the authorized banks. French francs, CFA francs, and Mali francs are purchased at their parity and sold w i th a commis- sion of 1 per cent. Administration of Control Exchange control au thor i ty is vested in the Central Bank and the Minister of Finance and Commerce. The former also supervises borrowing abroad, the issuing, advertising, or of- fering for sale of foreign securities in Mauritania, inward direct investment and all outward investment, the purchase abroad of domestic and foreign securities, and the solicitation of funds in Mauritania for placement in foreign countries. The approval au thor i ty in respect of exchange control has been delegated to the Central Bank, which in tu rn has delegated some approval au thor i ty to authorized banks. The Central Bank is authorized to collect, either direct or through the intermediary of the banks and the Postal Adm in is tra t ion, any information necessary to compile the balance of payments statistics. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through authorized banks.

SONIMEX has a monopoly over the import of sugar, rice, green tea, percales, and Guinea cloth. Import transactions relating to countries of the French Franc Area must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value exceeds UM 20,000, and import transactions re- la t ing to other foreign countries when their value exceeds UM 4,000. A f ter the approval of the Central Bank has been obtained, the import license or import certificate entitles the importer to purchase the necessary exchange, but not earlier than eight days before shipment if a documentary credit is opened or eight days before the payment is due if the com- modities have already been imported. Advance payments for imports require prior approval by the Central Bank. Payments for Invisibles Payments to Israel, Portugal, and South Africa are prohib- ited. Payments for invisibles to other countries are subject to the approval of the Central Bank, which has delegated its approval authority for certain specified payments and subject to conditions laid down in circulars, to authorized banks. For tourist and business travel, residents traveling to any foreign country may obtain an annual exchange allocation of an amount equivalent to UM 10,000 a person (UM 5,000 for children under ten). For business travel, a higher allocation may be granted only w i th special authorization by the Central Bank. The use of all travel allocations must be marked in a personal travel exchange booklet.

Capital movements between Mauritania and all foreign countries are subject to exchange control; capital transfers to all countries require exchange control approval and are restricted, but capital re- ceipts normally are permitted freely, although the subsequent investment of the funds in Mauritania may require approval, as indicated below. Special controls (additional to any exchange control re- quirements that may be applicable) are maintained over bor- rowing abroad, over inward direct investment and all outward investment, over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Mauritania, and over the solici- tation of funds in Mauritania for placement in foreign countries; these controls relate to the transactions themselves, not to payments or receipts. All investments abroad by residents of Mauritania require prior authorization by the Central Bank. Foreign direct in- vestments in Mauritania 3 and Mauritania direct investments abroad, 4 must be declared to the Central Bank before they are made. The Central Bank has a period of two months f rom receipt of the declaration during which it may request the postponement of the projects submitted to it. The full or partial liquidation of inward or outward investment also re- quires declaration. Both the making and the liquidation of investments, whether these are Mauritanian investments abroad or foreign investments in Mauritania, must be re- ported to the Central Bank w i th in 20 days following each operation. Direct investments are defined as investments im- plying control of a company or enterprise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 per cent in the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign secu- rities in Mauritania requires prior authorization by the Cen- tral Bank.

The repayment of loans not constituting a direct investment requires the special authori- zation of the Central Bank if the loan itself was subject to such approval, but is exempt if the loan was exempt from special authorization. Furthermore, such prior approval is required for the repayment of all amounts borrowed abroad prior to the publication of Decree No. 72.249 of November 27, 1972. Lending abroad is subject only to exchange control autho- rization. Domestic bank credit is restricted. The Investment Code (Law No. 71-028 of February 2, 1971) provides for various benefits for private investments in Mauritania. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Mauritania. Imports and exports of gold from or to any other country require prior authorization by the Cen- tral Bank. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports and exports by the Central Bank, (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quan t i ty of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles), and (3) imports and exports by travelers of certain gold articles. Changes during 1973 January 29. The commissions levied by the BCEAO on transfers to France were made identical with those on trans- fers to countries outside the French Franc Area. February 13. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the exchange rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02 was maintained; the effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously CFAF 255.785 = US$1, became CFAF 230.207 = US$1. February 15. Three cooperation agreements and two ex- changes of letters were signed with France. They replaced the treaty and the nine agreements signed in 1961. The monetary agreement with France was not renewed. The new economic and financial agreement provided that with respect to trade France would no longer be granted preferential treatment but would be treated like any other member country of the EEC. March 19. With the entry into effect of new margins ar- rangements between the French franc and certain other Euro- pean currencies, and the maintenance of the exchange rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02, the CFA franc began to appreciate in terms of the U.S. dollar.

A new law concerning financial relations with foreign countries, Law No. 73-137, was approved by the Parliament. It prescribed in principle the prior authorization of the Central Bank for all exchange transactions, and also dealt with the repatriation of claims on foreign countries and the compilation of the balance of payments by the Central Bank. June 18. The importation and exportation of domestic banknotes by travelers were prohibited. June 29. Mauritania issued its own currency, the ouguiya, to replace the CFA franc issued by the BCEAO. The ouguiya was defined as having a gold content of 0.016 gram of f ine gold. No appreciation or depreciation of the currency was involved. The resulting de facto relationship to the French franc was UM 10.0 = F 1.00. June 29. The dual exchange market was discontinued. Ex- change rates for non-Franc Area currencies were based on the fixed rate of UM 10.0 = F 1.00 and their rates against the French franc in the official exchange market in Paris. June 29. The basic exchange allocation for tourist travel was unified, irrespective of destination, at UM 10,000 a per- son a year. July 1. Mauritania ceased to be a member of the BCEAO and the West African Monetary Union. July 1. The Central Bank of Mauritania started operations. July 9. Mauritania ceased to be linked to the French Trea- sury by an Operations Account. Mauritania ceased to be treated as an Operations Account country by the countries of the French Franc Area. July 16. The CFA franc issued by the BCEAO ceased to be legal tender in Mauritania. July 16. Instruction No. 4 of July 6 came into effect. With minor exceptions, the authority of authorized banks to ap- prove exchange transactions was revoked and transferred to the Central Bank of Mauritania. The commercial banks were required to settle their foreign currency balances with the Central Bank at the close of each business day; previously they were permitted to have a foreign currency position of their own. October 11. All imports had to be purchased direct from the country of origin. 298 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAURITIUS Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.159961 gram of fine gold per Mauritian Rupee, corresponding to Mau Rs 5.55555 = SDR 1. No transactions take place at the par value. The official rate for sterling is Mau Re 1 = £ stg. 0.075, and the currency issuing authority, the Bank of Mauritius, maintains fixed rates for sterling of Mau Rs 13.31% buying, and Mau Rs 13.36% selling, per £ stg. 1. Consequently, the Mauritian rupee is floating with sterling, and all exchange transactions except those in sterling or currencies linked to sterling take place at fluctuating rates. Commercial banks are authorized to deal with customers in sterling at spot rates based on the rates of the Bank of Mauritius and in other foreign currencies * at rates based on the London market rates. The commercial banks' rates for sterling on December 31, 1973 were Mau Rs 13.25 buying and Mau Rs 13.40 selling per £ stg. 1, and for the U.S. dollar the rates were Mau Rs 5.71 buy ing and Mau Rs 5.82 selling (for transactions in excess of US$12,000). A different effective rate results from the application of a stamp du ty of 35.70 per cent to outward capital transfers other than transfers of banking funds and to payments for gold coins and gold bullion. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Bank of Mauritius under powers delegated to it by the Financial Secretary. The authority for approving practically all current payments is in turn delegated to the commercial banks. The M in is try of Commerce and Indus try is responsible for the issue of import and export licenses, where required. Prescription of Currency Mauritius has ceased to be a Scheduled Territory in terms of the U.K. Exchange Control Act, 1947 but under current U.K. exchange control regulations continues to be regarded as a country of the Overseas Sterling Area. For prescription of currency purposes Mauritius distinguishes between Ster- ling Area countries 2 and External Account countries. Pay- ments to residents of Sterling Area countries may be made in rupees to a Sterling Area Account in Mauritius or in any Sterling Area currency. Payments from residents of the Ster- ling Area may be received in rupees from a Sterling Area Account in Mauritius or in any currency of the Sterling Area. Payments to residents of countries outside the Sterling Area may be made in rupees to a Sterling Area Account or an External Account in Mauritius, in sterling to an External Account in the United Kingdom, or in any non-Sterling Area currency other than Rhodesian currency. Payments from resi- dents of countries outside the Sterling Area may be received in rupees from an External Account in Mauritius, in sterling 1 The exchange control regulations of Mauritius define foreign currencies as all currencies other than the Mauritian rupee. 2 The exchange control regulations of Mauritius define the Sterling Area as comprising the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, and the Republic of Ireland. from an External Account in the United Kingdom, or in any non-Sterling Area currency other than Rhodesian currency. Special regulations apply to settlements w i th Rhodesia. Nonresident Accounts There are two main types of nonresident accounts: Sterling Area Accounts and External Accounts. Sterling Area Accounts, which may be opened by persons and firms resident in countries of the Sterling Area (see foot- note 2), may be credited w i th (1) authorized payments by residents of Mauritius; (2) any transfers from other Sterling Area Accounts; (3) any payments from External Accounts held in Mauritius or elsewhere in the Sterling Area; and (4) the proceeds of the sale to an authorized dealer of any foreign currency (other than Rhodesian currency) or gold by nonresi- dents of Mauritius. They may be debited for (1) payments from residents of the Sterling Area to residents of Mauritius; (2) transfers to other Sterling Area Accounts; (3) transfers to External Accounts in Maur i t ius or elsewhere in the Sterling Area in respect of which the permission of the exchange control authorities in the appropriate Sterling Area coun try has been given; and (4) the cost of purchase of any Sterling Area currency. External Accounts may be opened by persons and firms resident outside both Mauritius and the Sterling Area. They may be credited with (1) authorized payments by residents of Mauritius; (2) payments from Sterling Area Accounts in re- spect of which the permission of the exchange control author- ities of the appropriate Sterling Area country has been given; (3) any transfers from other External Accounts; and (4) the proceeds of the sale to an authorized dealer of any non-Ster- ling Area currency (other than Rhodesian currency) or gold by nonresidents of Mauritius and the Sterling Area. They may be debited for (1) any payments to residents of Mauri- tius; (2) any transfers to Sterling Area Accounts; (3) any transfers to other External Accounts; and (4) the cost of purchase of any foreign currency (other than Rhodesian cur- rency) or gold. In addition to the above, there are also Blocked Accounts to which are credited funds owned by persons and firms resident outside Mauritius realized from investments made by them prior to April 5, 1966, as well as funds representing emigrants' assets in excess of Mau Rs 67,000. Such accounts may be credited w i th payments by residents of Maur i t ius that have been specifically authorized for credit to a Blocked Ac- count and may be debited for certain specified transactions. Funds from Blocked Accounts may, with approval, be in- vested in Mauritius. Upon the realization of such invest- ments, the proceeds are directed once more to a Blocked Account. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Rhodesia are prohibited. There is a list of commodities for which a specific license from the Ministry of Commerce and Indus t ry is required regardless of origin. All 299 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAURITIUS other goods may be freely imported under open general li- censes granted to individual traders when imported from countries of the Sterling Area (as defined before June 23, 1972), but most of these goods require a specific license when imported from non-Sterling Area countries. General licenses are granted liberally. Specific licenses are issued on the basis of domestic requirements. The issue of a general or specific license automatically carries with it exchange control author- ity to make the corresponding import payments, subject to compliance w i th the prescription of currency regulations. Payments for Invisibles Exchange to pay for invisibles related to imports, and also, up to certain limits, for certain other purposes such as travel, is provided by the commercial banks without prior reference to the exchange control authorities. The basic travel allow- ance for tourist purposes is the equivalent of £250 a person a year for travel to any country in the world except Rhodesia. The allowance for business travel purposes is the equivalent of £250 a tr ip or £20 a day up to a maximum of £1,000 a trip for travel to countries of the Sterling Area (as defined before June 23, 1972), or up to a total of £750 a trip for travel to countries outside the Sterling Area. Applications for ex- change for business travel are examined by the Bank of Mau- ritius when exceeding the equivalent of £250 a person a trip. There are also established limits for payments and transfers to Sterling Area countries and to non-Sterling Area countries in respect of fam i ly support, salary remittances by non-Mau- ritian nationals, trade commissions, subscriptions to clubs and societies, publishing rights, advertising outside Mauri- tius, royalties, professional and technical services, education, and leave salaries. Applications for amounts exceeding the standard allocations may be submitted to the exchange con- trol authorities. Residents and nonresident travelers may take out Mau Rs 350 in domestic currency. Resident travelers may take out foreign currency notes up to the amount of their travel allow- ance. Nonresident travelers may take out any foreign cur- rency declared upon en t ry. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Rhodesia are prohibited. Also prohibited, un- less permission is obtained from the Financial Secretary, are exports of (1) articles made wholly or partially of gold, plati- num, or silver; (2) diamonds, precious and semiprecious stones, pearls, and articles mounted with these; and (3) works of art. All exports valued at more than Mau Rs 1,000 and all exports of food valued at over Mau Rs 50 require a license from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The Mauritius Sugar Syndicate is the sole exporter of sugar, and a 6-9 per cent export tax is levied on sugar exports. All export proceeds in any currency other than Mauritian rupees must be offered for sale to an authorized dealer. However, permission may be given to large export-import companies to retain export pro- ceeds for a reasonable period of time to meet payments for imports. 300 Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in any currency other than Mauri- tian rupees must be offered for sale to an authorized bank. There is no limitation on the amount of foreign currency notes and coins that may be imported, but not more than Mau Rs 700 in domestic currency notes and coins may be imported by travelers. Capital Inward transfers of capital are not restricted. Outward transfers of capital are subject to certain restrictions. Non- bank residents of Mauritius may transfer a reasonable amount of capital to any country in the Sterling Area (as defined in footnote 2) on payment of a 35.70 per cent stamp du ty (a du ty of 34 per cent plus a surcharge of 5 per cent thereon); they may, subject to permission, which is freely granted, also transfer a reasonable amount of capital to Ex- ternal Account Area countries on payment of the stamp duty. Nonresidents require permission to transfer capital to any country; transfers are subject to the payment of stamp duty at the rate of 35.70 per cent and, if directed toward a country outside the Sterling Area by a resident of the Sterling Area, require the prior approval of the exchange control authorities of the Sterling Area coun try concerned. Foreign-owned com- panies may freely transfer abroad dividends, profits, and in- terest on capital. Permission for the repatriation of capital is not granted for capital brought in before April 5, 1966, irre- spective of the country of origin, but is, in normal circum- stances, given for capital brought in on or after that date. Proceeds from the sale, liquidation, etc., of foreign capital that may not be repatriated must be credited to Blocked Accounts. Emigrants may take out, at the official rate of exchange and free of stamp du ty, the equivalent of Mau Rs 67,000 from their Mauritian assets when emigrating to any country except Rhodesia; this facility is available upon redesignation as a nonresident, which occurs upon departure. The balance of an emigrant's funds must be credited for an indefinite period to a Blocked Account; any releases that may be approved for transfer abroad are subject to payment of the 35.70 per cent stamp du ty. Persons emigrating from Mauritius are not enti- tled to draw their personal travel allowance in addition to the emigration facilities. Gold Residents other than the monetary authorities are permit- ted to hold gold in the form of numismatic coins (including a commemorative gold coin of Mau Rs 200 issued by Mauri- tius in 1971) or personal jewelry and ornaments. The import and export of monetary gold are prohibited, except when made by the monetary authorities. Imports of gold for indus- trial purposes are subject to a quota and specific import license. Exports of articles made wholly or partially of gold, other than jewelry constituting the personal effects of a trav- eler, are prohibited. Payments in respect of private imports of gold coins and gold bullion are subject to the 35.70 per cent stamp du ty. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MAURITIUS Changes during 1973 January 1. The Exchange Control (General Exemption) Order, 1972 of October 31, 1972 replaced the corresponding order of April 5, 1966. The effect was to rescind the exemp- tion from surrender of any Sterling Area currency balances held by residents as at April 5, 1966 as well as foreign cur- rency accruals to residents on securities registered in the Ster- ling Area (as defined before June 23, 1972) held by them as at April 5, 1966, and the exemption from the requirement of deposit with an authorized depository of certificates of ti- tle to Sterling Area securities owned by residents prior to April 5, 1966 and held outside Mauritius. A grace period of three years was, however, given to the persons concerned to comply with the relevant restrictions. February 12. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the fixed relationship to sterling was maintained at Mau Re 1 = £ stg. 0.075, and the Mauri- tian rupee continued to float with sterling. June 1. Mauritius became associated with the EEC under the Yaounde Convention. June 16. The Commonwealth tariff preferences were ex- tended to imports from member countries of the EEC and from the United States. December 18. A revised schedule of ad valorem export tax on sugar was introduced, with effect from July 1, 1973. The tax ranged from 6 per cent to 9 per cent, varying with the total tonnage exported by a person. A person exporting not more than 20 metric tons was exempt. 301 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MEXICO Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.0589330 gram of fine gold per Mexican Peso, corresponding to Mex$ 15.0793 = SDR 1 or Mex$12.50 = US$1. On December 31, 1973 the official rates for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, were Mex$ 12.49 buying, and Mex$12.51 selling, per US$1. Banks may freely engage in exchange transactions between the peso and any other currency. There are limited forward facilities for Mexican pesos. On November 12, 1946, Mexico notified the Fund that it was prepared to formally accept the obligations of Arti- cle V I I I, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Prescription of Currency No obligations prescribing the method or currency for pay- ments to or from nonresidents are imposed on importers, exporters, or others. In accordance with payments agree- ments with Hungary, Poland, and Yugoslavia, payments for direct commercial transactions and related expenses with those countries handled through the Mexican banking system may, with the prior authorization of the Bank of Mexico, be made through special accounts denominated in U.S. dollars. Payments between Mexico and Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela may be settled through accounts maintained with each other by the Bank of Mexico and the central banks concerned, within the framework of the LAFTA multilateral clearing system. Payments to Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guate- mala, Honduras, and Nicaragua in respect of trade and invisi- bles may be settled in Mexican pesos or Central American currencies in accordance with the reciprocal credit agreement between the central banks of those countries. Imports and Import Payments Payments and transfers abroad may be made freely. A few imports are prohibited. All imports must be accompanied by an exporter's declaration of shipment. For a considerable number of items, import licenses from the Ministry of Indus- try and Trade are required before firm orders are placed; the issuance of such licenses may be subject to quantitative re- striction, but most of the items concerned do not require an import license when they originate in LAFTA countries. For specified commodities, "open end" import licenses (permisos abiertos) may be granted that permit limited importation dur- ing a specified period of time, such as six months or a year; subject to screening of the importer's performance, repeated renewal of the license is possible. Applications for import licenses are screened by the Ministry of Industry and Trade with the aid of committees composed of importers, produc- ers, and consumers. Import licenses for certain goods, includ- ing leather goods, alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, and automobiles and their spare parts, are subject to an overall annual limit. Imports of certain goods for which licenses from the Ministry of Industry and Trade are required (such as unassembled automobiles and trucks, iron and steel pipe, 302 firearms, watches, synthetic fibers, some types of jewelry, radio and television sets, and whiskey, wines, and other li- quors) are subject to the payment of a fee of usually between 1 per cent and 6 per cent of the value of the import transac- tions, the proceeds of which are allocated to a fund handled by the Mexican Foreign Trade Institute (I MCE) for the pro- motion of exports. Imports by official Mexican agencies are subject to prior approval by the Mexican Foreign Trade Insti- tute; this approval is not given if a reasonably competitive domestic equivalent is available at a price differential of 15- 20 per cent. Many nonessential imports are subject to an import surcharge of 10 per cent ad valorem, the proceeds of which accrue to an export trust fund the Federal Government has established in the Bank of Mexico. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles are not restricted. The contracting of insurance for persons in Mexico, or on property of Mexican ownership, or where the risks are for the account of persons in Mexico or may occur in Mexico, is permitted with Mexican companies or with branches of foreign companies established in Mexico in accordance w i th Mexican law. Exports and Export Proceeds Certain exports require licenses. No exchange control re- quirements apply to the proceeds of exports. Tax remission is granted on exports of certain manufactured and semimanu- factured products, provided that at least 50 per cent of the direct cost of production is of Mexican origin and that they are on a list of products authorized by the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit. Certain exports are granted rebates of indirect taxes by means of a system of CEDIs (certificados de devolution de impuestos). Proceeds from Invisibles No exchange control requirements apply to proceeds from invisibles. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or payments by residents or nonresidents. New for- eign investment, other than by private individuals, in the capital of Mexican banking or insurance companies and in- vestment funds is prohibited. Certain sectors, such as petro- leum, basic petrochemical production, radioactive minerals, electricity and nuclear energy, certain mining activities, rail- roads, and telecommunications, are reserved to government investment. Investment in a number of activities is reserved exclusively for Mexican individuals or corporations (radio and television, the public transportation system, forestry, etc., as well as any other areas specified by the Federal Gov- ernment), while new investments in other sectors must have a majority participation of Mexican capital. Foreign invest- ments in Mexico must be registered with the National For- ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution etgn Investment Register in the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Applications by foreign physical or juridical per- sons to acquire more than 25 per cent of the capital of a Mexican company, or over 49 per cent of its fixed assets, require the prior authorization of the competent ministry, after the National Foreign Investment Commission has granted the necessary registration. Borrowing abroad (or within Mexico in foreign currency) by the public sector and by state-owned banks is subject to approval by the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit. Borrowing abroad by private banks is subject to approval by the Bank of Mexico. Gold Domestic transactions in nonmonetary gold are limited to purchases of gold bars by licensed goldsmiths or manufactur- ers. With this exception, residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form in Mexico or abroad. The Bank of Mexico does not buy or sell gold in transactions with private banks, individuals, or firms. There is a 15 per cent tax on "first hand" sales of newly mined gold. Producers of gold undertaking not to sell it at prices exceeding international quotations plus normal marketing costs are eligible for a subsidy corresponding to the full 15 per cent tax, when selling newly mined gold in Mexico to private banks reselling such gold to licensed goldsmiths or manufacturers in Mexico. Ex- ports of gold are prohibited unless they are made by the Bank of Mexico. Imports of gold are permitted and when licensed by the Bank of Mexico are free of customs duty. Changes during 1973 January 1. The income tax on fixed-income securities of the banking system was modified to increase rates on bearer securities and administration contracts while rates on nomi- native administration contracts were maintained; as a result, interest payable to foreign creditors other than international agencies became subject to tax at a rate of 10 per cent. The withholding tax on interest earned by registered foreign fi- nancial institutions remained at 10 per cent. January 30. A Law for the Registration of Transfer of Technology and Use and Exploitation of Patents and Trade- marks (issued by a decree of December 30, 1972) came into force. Companies domiciled in Mexico were required to regis- ter with a National Register of Technology Transfer in the Ministry of Industry and Commerce all agreements on the use of foreign trademarks and patents and all forms of techni- cal assistance. Registration could be refused under certain circumstances. February 2. The tax rebate granted in the form of CEDIs on exports of manufactured goods (with at least 60 per cent of the direct cost of production of Mexican origin) was in- creased from 10 per cent to 11 per cent; when registered foreign trade firms took part in the export transaction, an extra 4 per cent was granted. February 13. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the Bank of Mexico maintained its official buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar unchanged at Mex$ 12.49 and Mex$ 12.51, respectively. MEXICO May 8. A Law to Promote Mexican Investment and Regu- late Foreign Investment (issued by a decree of March 9, 1973) came into force. The law regulated foreign investment in Mexico, in part by consolidating existing legislation, and cre- ated a National Foreign Investment Register in the Ministry of Indus try and Commerce, as well as a National Foreign Investment Commission. Applications by foreign companies or individuals to acquire more than 25 per cent of a Mexican company's capital, or over 49 per cent of its fixed assets, required authorization by the ministry concerned, after the Commission had granted registration. Foreign participation would, in principle, be limited to 49 per cent even in previ- ously unrestricted activities, but the Commission was em- powered to grant exceptions for investment in certain areas and economic sectors. All shares held in Mexican companies by foreigners must be nominative, and existing bearer shares in companies with a majority of foreign capital must, within 180 days of the law coming into force, be converted into nominative shares. An investment was regarded as foreign also when made by Mexican companies in which a majority of the capital was foreign owned, or by Mexican businesses in which foreigners had the right to control their manage- ment. June 21. A Presidential Decree was issued regulating the operations of development corporations. These corporations would be active in acquiring shares in foreign-owned indus- trial companies. Shareholdings in development corporations were restricted to Mexican citizens. July 11. The National Foreign Investment Commission exempted in-bond industries (maquiladoras) from the re- quirement of 51 per cent Mexican ownership. It announced that border industries (in-bond plants, manufacturing or pro- cessing goods exclusively for export) could continue to be partially or wholly foreign owned; partially foreign-owned companies would be allowed to increase their capital pro- vided that the ratio of foreign to domestic share ownership existing when the Foreign Investment Law came into force, remained unchanged. August 20. The reserve requirements for deposit banks were increased. At the same time, those located in northern border areas were authorized to accept time deposits denominated in U.S. dollars of 90 or 180 days' maturity, but only from for- eign nationals and from residents of the district where the bank concerned was located. September 12. Mexico decided to participate fully, as an observer, in the multilateral trade negotiations of the GATT. October 17. The par value was changed from 0.0654810 gram to 0.0589330 gram of fine gold per Mexican peso. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar remained un- changed at Mex$12.50 = US$1. Mexico did not avail itself of wider margins. October 20. Purchases of Mexican shares by foreign physi- cal or juridical persons henceforth could only be made on the stock exchange; any individual purchase could not exceed 5 per cent of the equity capital of the company concerned. November 2 7. The Bank of Mexico issued guidelines for the credit operations of banks and other financial institutions. Companies having external credit lines would be permitted to 303 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MEXICO borrow domestically only after the credit needs of other prior- ity sectors had been satisfied. December 29. Regulations were issued providing for the establishment of a National Foreign Investors Registry; they came into effect on February 12, 1974. Any foreign physical or juridical person acquiring stock in a Mexican company, whether on a stock exchange or otherwise, and any Mexican company selling its shares to a foreign physical or juridical person, were required to register the transaction within 30 days thereafter. 304 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MOROCCO Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.175610 gram of fine gold per Moroccan Dirham, corresponding to DH 5.06049 = SDR 1. However, no transactions take place at the par value. The Bank of Morocco quotes daily buying and selling rates for the com- mercial French franc and the financial French franc; its rate for the commercial franc is determined in the light of quota- tions for certain major currencies on the official exchange market in Paris and taking into account the geographic distri- bution of Morocco's foreign trade transactions. The Bank of Morocco also quotes buying and selling rates for specified "convertible currencies," l based on quotations in the leading foreign exchange markets abroad and the Bank of Moroc- co's daily quotation for the commercial French franc. The rates of the Bank of Morocco for the U.S. dollar on Decem- ber 31,1973 were DH 4.2802 buying, and DH 4.2996 selling, per US$1, and those for the commercial French franc were DH 0.90973 buying, and DH 0.91247 selling, per F 1. All sales and purchases of foreign currency are centralized in the Bank of Morocco, but the authorized banks are permit- ted to marry (offset) their purchases and sales on behalf of their private customers in each currency separately. The au- thorized banks must purchase from or sell to the Bank of Morocco each day, at the rates communicated to them by the Bank, the balances of their purchases and sales in each cur- rency; compensation between banks is not permitted so that no foreign exchange market exists in Morocco. The Bank of Morocco makes its own purchases and sales of foreign cur- rency in exchange markets abroad. The Bank of Morocco also establishes buying and selling rates for transactions with trav- elers in banknotes, travelers checks, and letters of credit ex- pressed in French francs, CFA francs, and the "convertible currencies"; the authorized banks sell to the Bank of Morocco their excess holdings of banknotes and replenish them at the Bank whenever necessary. Forward exchange transactions are not permitted. Foreign currency repatriated in the form of bank or postal transfers by Moroccan workers abroad is eligible for a pre- mium of 5 per cent payable on the dirham equivalent. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Exchange Office, an agency under the Ministry of Finance. This Office has delegated the execution of certain exchange control measures to authorized banks. Import certificates and export licenses are issued by the Ministry of Commerce; they must be coun- tersigned by the Moroccan Exchange Office. Import commit- ments for liberalized goods are signed by the importer himself; they do not require the visa of the Exchange Office unless the country of origin of the goods is not the country of shipment, or the goods are bought on a c.i.f. basis. A part of the port of Tangier is designated as a free trade zone and 'Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Italian lire, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portu- guese escudos, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. is exempt from taxation and from trade, customs, and ex- change control. Prescription of Currency Although Morocco's regulations still make a distinction between the French Franc Area and the so-called area of convertibility, Morocco applies exchange control also to transactions with the former. 2 For prescription of currency purposes, countries are classified as follows: (1) the French Franc Area countries; (2) the payments agreement group, comprising countries with which Morocco maintains bilateral payments agreements; 3 and (3) all other countries, the so-called area of convertibility. Settlements with the French Franc Area are made in French francs or, with the exception of settlements for im- ports, in dirhams through French Franc Area Accounts (see section on Nonresident Accounts, below); certain noncom- mercial settlements with Algeria and Tunisia, however, are made in dirhams, Algerian dinars, and Tunisian dinars through special accounts at the three central banks. Settle- ments with the payments agreement group are made by debit- ing or crediting the payments agreements accounts established for this purpose. Imports originating in countries in the area of convertibility may be paid for only in "converti- ble currencies" negotiated by the Bank of Morocco (see foot- note 1). Other settlements with countries in the area of convertibility may be made only in "convertible currencies" negotiated by the Bank of Morocco or through Foreign Ac- counts in Convertible Dirhams. When settlements between Morocco and the French Franc Area take place in French francs, the Bank of Morocco ap- plies its daily quotation for the commercial French franc when the transaction passes through the French official ex- change market, and its daily quotation for the financial French franc when the transaction passes through the finan- cial market in France. Nonresident Accounts The various types of nonresident accounts are as follows: 1. French Franc Area Accounts are held in Moroccan cur- rency by residents of countries of the French Franc Area. These accounts may be used for settlements with residents of countries in the French Franc Area, except for the payment for imports (and related invisibles) from those countries. 4 They may be freely credited with and debited for sales or purchases of financial French francs (except banknotes) sold to or bought from the Bank of Morocco. Transfers between French Franc Area Accounts may be made freely. * Since February 1967, France has applied to Morocco its controls on foreign investments in France and on French investments abroad. The exchange controls imposed by France on November 25, 1968 in its financial relations with foreign countries are applied also to Morocco. 3 Bulgaria, People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Egypt, Guinea, Hungary, Mali, Poland, and U.S.S.R. 4 Imports from the French Franc Area, unless covered by special credit arrangements, must be paid for with commercial French francs purchased from the Bank of Morocco. 305 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MOROCCO 2. Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dirhams art reserved for residents of countries in the area of convertibility. These ac- counts may be credited freely with authorized payments due to residents of countries in the area of convertibility (but not in respect of imports or related invisibles) and with dirhams obtained from the sale to the Bank of Morocco of "converti- ble currencies" negotiated by it, excluding banknotes. They may be debited freely for payments in Morocco and for pur- chases from the Bank of Morocco of the "convertible curren- cies" negotiated by it, including banknotes. Transfers between Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dirhams may be made freely. 3. Payments Agreement Accounts are held by the Bank of Morocco for central banks (or similar institutions) of the countries with which Morocco maintains bilateral payments agreements (see footnote 3); they are used only for settle- ments with these countries, including settlements for imports and exports. 4. Capital Accounts, which may be held by any nonresident, are credited with funds that may not be transferred abroad. These include the proceeds from the sale on the Casablanca stock exchange of Moroccan securities held under foreign dossier and proceeds from the contractual or accelerated re- demption of such securities. Transfers between Capital Ac- counts related to (1) countries either in the area of convertibility or the French Franc Area or (2) the same coun- try in the payments agreement group, are permitted freely. Capital Accounts may be debited freely for (1) purchases of specified 5% per cent, seven-year government bonds; inter- est and redemption proceeds are transferable, and the bonds are freely negotiable between nonresidents; and (2) personal expenses of the account holder and his immediate relatives during visits to Morocco, up to DH 150 a person a day, subject to a limit of DH 5,000 a year for each account. All other operations through Capital Accounts require individual approval. These include purchases on the Casablanca stock exchange of Moroccan and non-Moroccan securities; pur- chases of Moroccan securities not quoted in Casablanca or of participation in a Moroccan firm; subscriptions to either; investments of any kind, including purchases of businesses or office buildings; lending to residents; payment of local ex- penses in excess of DH 5,000 during the holder's stay in Morocco; any such payments to beneficiaries other than the holder of the account or a close relative of his; any such payments from an account held by a foreign juridical person; gifts to social, cultural, or religious institutions; subscriptions to capital increases of Moroccan companies whose shares are quoted on the Casablanca stock exchange; subscriptions at the time of issue to long-term or short-term securities with a fixed yield issued by a Moroccan public entity; custody charges and commissions on securities; and payment of the costs of maintenance, repairs, real estate taxes, and insurance on real estate taxes, and insurance on real estate located in Morocco. Subject to approval, Capital Accounts may also be debited for investments in Morocco, within the framework of the 1973 Investment Code, provided that the amounts deb- ited do not exceed 50 per cent of the investment undertaken by the nonresident or 25 per cent of the company's total capital. 306 5. Suspense Accounts are used for holding nonresident funds not available for credit to any of the accounts men- tioned above. Balances on these accounts may be used freely to pay taxes due to the Moroccan authorities, but all other debits to these accounts require approval. 6. Two Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dirhams are held by the Bank of Morocco for the Central Bank of Algeria and the Central Bank of Tunisia. Specified transactions between Morocco and the two other countries concerned are settled through these accounts. Imports and Import Payments Imports are admitted in accordance with an annual Gen- eral Import Program. Imports from Rhodesia are prohibited. Imports are divided into three categories applicable to all countries. Goods in List A are liberalized. Goods in List B are restricted, in some cases by a global quota, or are subject to state trading; for a large number of List B items, no quotas are established and imports are approved according to need (SB items). In principle, the importation of goods in List C is not permitted. To import goods in List A, the importer signs an import commitment (engagement d'importation), which does not require administrative approval unless the goods are imported from a country other than that of origin or are purchased on a c.i.f. basis,5 but for goods in List B, an import license (automation d"importation or certificat d* importation) must be obtained. For all imports the import title—import certificate or im- port commitment —must be domiciled (registered) with an authorized bank, which may make payments upon submis- sion of the required documents. Import certificates require the visa of the Exchange Office before the foreign exchange is made available. Import commitments require this visa only when the country of origin and the country of shipment of the goods concerned differ or when imports are contracted for on a c.i.f. basis. Import certificates must be domiciled within 15 days from the date that the Exchange Office approves the license. Import commitments must be domiciled at the time of their subscription. Special procedures are applicable to specified imports financed by foreign aid or loans. Most imports from countries in the payments agreement group are made in accordance with the quotas established in the respective trade agreements. Imports can also be licensed under compensation transactions. Payments for Invisibles Payments for most current invisibles require the approval of the Exchange Office upon presentation of the necessary justification; in several instances the approval authority has been delegated to the banks. The authorized banks are per- mitted to make payments and settle expenses incidental to the commercial transaction covered by the relevant import or export documents. Earnings after tax on approved nonresi- dent investments in Morocco are transferable to the inves- tor's country of residence. The transfer of dividends on non- resident-owned shares of Moroccan companies having their 5 C.i.f. imports of List A goods require prior exchange control approval. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution main office in Morocco requires the approval of the Exchange Office. Undistributed profits relating to the financial year 1968 or later remain transferable indefinitely. Some payments are subject to limitations. A foreign em- ployee may transfer to his country of origin, subject to the initial approval of the Exchange Office, 50 per cent of his monthly wages or salary if his family does not reside in Mo- rocco, or 30 per cent if he is single or his family lives in Morocco. The same percentages of their monthly earnings may be transferred by foreign nationals engaged in profes- sions, subject (except for the medical and related professions) to a limit of DH 12,000 a year. 8 Subject to a monthly limit of DH 300, the same percentages of earnings may also be transferred by foreign nationals engaged in agricultural, in- dustrial, or commercial activities, or in skilled crafts. Foreign nationals employed in the hotel sector are authorized to transfer 65 per cent of their monthly salaries or wages. An allocation of foreign exchange equivalent to DH 100 a person a year is granted to residents of any nationality for travel abroad, provided that they do not make periodic transfers abroad. There is a special allocation for pilgrimages. Resi- dents of foreign nationality may acquire exchange for tourist travel up to the equivalent of DH 2,500 for each passport a year by selling to an authorized bank a corresponding amount in foreign exchange (other than banknotes) from their own foreign assets not subject to surrender requirements. For business travel by persons other than exporters a stan- dard allowance of DH 150 a day is granted; exporters may be granted up to DH 200 a day for up to 60 days a year, up to a limit of 1 per cent of the foreign exchange surrendered during the preceding year. The allocation issued for business travel may be added to the allocation issued for tourist travel. For study abroad, a monthly allocation of foreign exchange up to DH 500-700 is granted, provided that no comparable educational facilities are available in Morocco; Moroccan stu- dents taking college or university level courses abroad are entitled to an annual installation allowance equivalent to DH 1,000. For family maintenance, the Exchange Office gen- erally grants a monthly allocation in the order of DH 250- 300. Travelers are not permitted to take out Moroccan bank- notes. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Rhodesia are prohibited. Most exports may be made freely, although export licenses are required for a few items. All fruits, fresh vegetables, canned goods, raw cotton, and cotton by-products may be exported only by a state trading agency, the Office of Marketing and Export (Office de Commercialisation et d'Exportation—OCE). That Office also is in charge of wine exports. All exporters must sign an undertaking to repatriate and surrender the foreign exchange proceeds of their exports. The surrender of the proceeds to the exporter's bank must take place within one month from the date the payment is due. The date on which the payment is due is the ma tur i ty date fixed 6 For all wages, salaries, and professional earnings, monthly transfers which exceed by more than DH 100 the amount transferred in June 1973 require prior authorization by the Exchange Office. MOROCCO in the commercial contract; this date must not be set, in principle, more than 90 days after the date of arrival of the merchandise at the place of destination. When the bank re- ceiving the funds that represent the proceeds from exports receives the advice of credit in foreign currency from abroad, it must surrender the foreign exchange immediately to the Bank of Morocco. Proceeds from Invisibles Residents of Moroccan nationality and Moroccan compa- nies must repatriate exchange receipts accruing from all their noncommercial claims and surrender them to an authorized bank. Other residents must surrender noncommercial re- ceipts only if the receipts result from current transactions, and only when they accrue in foreign currencies other than those of the French Franc Area. Moroccans working abroad must surrender such currencies within one mon th of re-entry, but are permitted, when leaving again, to repurchase 15 per cent of the amount surrendered (the currencies so purchased may also include French francs); they are entitled to a bonus of 5 per cent on the dirham equivalent of any foreign ex- change repatriated in the form of bank or postal transfers. The importation of Moroccan banknotes is prohibited. Non- resident travelers may bring in freely foreign banknotes; for- eign exchange brought in in excess of the equivalent of DH 5,000 must be declared to the customs authorities. Resi- dent travelers also may bring in any amount in foreign bank- notes, but these must be surrendered within 30 days of re-entry. Capital Residents of Moroccan nationality, as well as companies established in Morocco, are obliged to declare to the Ex- change Office all foreign-held assets exceeding DH 250, and to repatriate and surrender certain of these assets. The dis- posal of other foreign-held assets requires permission. The transfer of capital abroad by residents must be approved. Remittances in respect of the assets of emigrants and trans- fers of gifts are not normally approved. Exchange allocations for the transfer of inheritances are limited to DH 35,000 a beneficiary. Those for the transfer of their assets by repatri- ates vary with the length of their stay in Morocco, from DH 35,000 a family with previous residence of 3 to 5 years to DH 100,000 a family where the period of residence has been 15 to 25 years. New foreign investments in specified sectors of the econ- omy may benefit from the provisions of the Investment Code of August 15, 1973. The Code consists of six laws and several implementing decrees providing various tax concessions and other incentives. It guarantees the transfer of dividends dis- tributed to nonresidents and of proceeds from the liquidation of the capital brought in by the foreign investor. Investments financed with funds held in Capital Accounts (see section on Nonresident Accounts, above) also are eligible for the bene- fits of the Code; proceeds from the liquidation of investments financed in this manner become transferable after a minimum investment period of 5 years. 307 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution MOROCCO Foreign investments approved under the previous Invest- ment Code (of February 10, 1961) continue to benefit from the retransfer guarantee for the liquidation proceeds. Pro- ceeds from the liquidation of other investments are credited to Capital Accounts. Certain government bonds acquired with funds from Capi- tal Accounts are freely negotiable between nonresidents. All other transactions in securities involving nonresident inter- ests, as well as the import and export of securities, require approval. Banks are not permitted to engage in short-term borrowing abroad except with special authorization from the monetary authorities. Gold Residents may purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in Mo- rocco for numismatic or investment purposes. Ten different types of foreign gold coins are traded on the Casablanca stock exchange, which does not, however, deal in gold bars or ingots. Imports and exports of gold are prohibited unless authorized by the Warranty Office in the Directorate of Cus- toms and Indirect Taxes, which derives its approval authority from the Minister of Finance. Every year the Minister of Finance fixes a quota for the importation of gold ingots, which is then allocated among jewelers and other users. Changes during 1973 January. Notice to Importers No. 301 was published con- taining the General Import Program for 1973. Its structure remained substantially unchanged from that for 1972. February 15. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the par value of the dirham was maintained in terms of gold. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously DH 4.66097 = US$1, became DH 4.19488 = US$1. March 2. Law No. 1-73-210 (as amended by Law No. 1-73-339 of May 7, 1973) imposed the obligation on foreign investors in the commercial and services sectors (excluding tourism) and in a number of industrial subsectors to share their ownership with Moroccan nationals. The measure was referred to as Moroccanization. March 7. Law No. 1-73-213 of March 2 was published. It provided that, with effect from its date of publication, all agricultural property owned by foreign natural or juridical persons was to be transferred to the State. Joint orders of the Ministries of Interior, Agriculture, and Agrarian Reform were to specify the property to be transferred to the State and the date of their take-over. May 8. Decree No. 2-73-220 was published comprising two lists of economic activities in which non-Moroccan physical or juridical persons had to comply with the Moroccanization measures; for the first list they had to do so by May 31, 1974, and for the second list by May 31, 1975. May 17. The fixed relationship between the dirham and the commercial French franc, previously DH 1 = F 1.09755 or DH 0.9111 = F 1, was discontinued. Henceforth, the rate for the dirham in terms of the commercial French franc was fixed daily, in accordance with variations in the quotations of the commercial franc in terms of certain major foreign currencies 308 and taking into account the geographic distribution of Mo- rocco's foreign transactions. Rates for certain other curren- cies were quoted on the basis of the daily rate for the commercial French franc in terms of dirhams and the cross rates for these currencies against the commercial franc pre- vailing in major foreign exchange markets. May 18. Exchange Office Circular No. 1256 provided that Moroccan workers going abroad for the first time could pur- chase foreign exchange up to the equivalent of DH 300. This allocation was additional to that for tourism. July 5. Exchange Office Circular No. 1252 raised the an- nual installation allowance for Moroccans studying abroad from the equivalent of DH 800 to DH 1,000 and made this exchange allocation available also to those who were not scholarship students. July 19. Exchange Office Notice No. 143 required nonresi- dent travelers entering Morocco to declare to the customs authorities any foreign exchange brought in in excess of the equivalent of DH 5,000. July 30. Dahir No. 1-73-400 introduced with immediate effect a 5 per cent bonus payable on the dirham equivalent of any foreign exchange repatriated by Moroccans working abroad in the form of bank or postal transfers. August 15. A new Investment Code was published. It con- sisted of six laws and several implementing decrees. The Code provided additional incentives for foreign and domestic in- vestment in specified sectors of the economy. Certain blocked nonresident-owned funds held in Capital Accounts also were eligible for investment projects covered by the Code. Pro- ceeds from the liquidation of investments financed by such funds could be transferred freely after a minimum investment period of five years. Law No. 1-73-408 provided that export- ers engaged in specified industrial and handicraft sectors could purchase foreign exchange up to 3 per cent of their export turnover for expenses connected with advertising, for- eign market research, and maintenance of foreign branches. The Investment Code of February 10, 1961 (Dahir No. 1-60-383 of December 31, 1960, published in the Official Gazette of February 10, 1961) was abrogated with immediate effect. The retransfer guarantees previously granted under that Code remained in effect. September 4. Exchange Office Circular No. 1(259) revised the regulations governing Capital Accounts. It established limits up to which the accounts could be debited for invest- ments within the framework of the new Investment Code. The amount that an account holder could withdraw for local expenses during visits to Morocco was raised from DH 100 a day to DH 150 a day, up to a maximum of DH 5,000 a year for each account. Transfers between Capital Accounts related to countries in the area of convertibility and those related to countries of the French Franc Area, previously prohibited, were permitted freely. The approval authority for the transfer of income and redemption proceeds from Moroccan securities held under foreign dossier, and for the transfer of dividends paid to nonresident shareholders by companies having their main office in Morocco and approved by the Exchange Office, ceased to be delegated to authorized banks. Exchange control approval became required for debits to Capital Accounts for a number of transactions, including purchases of Moroccan ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution securities on the Casablanca stock exchange, subscriptions to long-term or short-term obligations with a fixed yield issued by a public Moroccan entity, custody charges and commis- sions on securities held for nonresidents, and costs of mainte- nance, repairs, taxes, and insurance on real estate located in Morocco. Circular No. 989 of June 20, 1960 was revoked, December 11. The bilateral payments agreement with Cuba was terminated. MOROCCO 309 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NEPAL Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.0808408 gram of fine gold per Nepalese Rupee, corresponding to NRs 10.9929 = SDR 1. A central rate has been established of NRs 12.7390 = SDR 1, corre- sponding to NRs 10.56 = US$1, and Nepal avails itself of wider margins. The Nepal Rastra Bank (the central bank) maintains fixed buying and selling rates for U.S. dollars and Indian rupees as follows: NRs 10.50 buying and NRs 10.60 selling per US$1, and NRs 139.00 buying and NRs 139.15 selling per 100 Indian rupees. Daily rates are quoted for Canadian dollars, deutsche mark, Japanese yen, pounds ster- ling, Swiss francs, and certain other currencies. Different ef- fective exchange rates arise from the operation of an Exporters' Exchange Entitlement Scheme. Most of Nepal's foreign exchange transactions are in terms of Indian rupees. Residents may freely purchase Indian rupees from Nepalese banks and they may hold any amount of Indian notes and coins, but the Indian rupee is not legal tender. Administration of Control A Foreign Exchange Committee, consisting of representa- tives from the Nepal Rastra Bank and the Ministries of Fi- nance, Foreign Affairs, and Industry and Commerce, prepares an annual foreign exchange budget for foreign cur- rencies other than the Indian rupee and excluding transac- tions with the clearing countries. Permission is required from the Ministry of Finance for all foreign payments, except pay- ments for certain specified invisibles that require authoriza- tion from the Nepal Rastra Bank. Import and export licensing is the responsibility of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. All exchange transactions with countries other than India .must be settled through authorized dealers, i.e., the Nepal Bank Ltd. and the Rastriya Vanijya Bank. Within Nepal there are 58 additional authorized dealers licensed to purchase foreign currencies; any sale of such currencies other than Indian rupees is subject to the prior approval of the Nepal Rastra Bank. All import and export transactions with payments agreement countries, as well as all barter trade, are conducted through a state trading agency, the National Trad- ing Ltd. Most government imports are made through the National Trading Ltd. or through the Agricultural Market- ing Corporation. Prescription of Currency No prescription of currency requirements apply to outgo- ing payments to countries with which no payments agreement is in force and these may be made in the foreign currency supplied by the Nepal Rastra Bank. Payments for imports from India normally are settled in Indian rupees, but the Nepal Rastra Bank sometimes makes convertible currencies available for such imports. The proceeds of exports to India are obtained in Indian or Nepalese rupees; the proceeds of exports to other countries must be received in any of the convertible currencies quoted by the Nepal Rastra Bank. Nepal has bilateral payments agreements with Bulgaria, the 310 People's Republic of China, Pakistan, and Poland; payments between Nepal and these countries must be made through special accounts. The agreement with Pakistan is inoperative. Nonresident Accounts The Nepal Rastra Bank permits nonresidents other than Indian nationals upon request to open "convertible rupee accounts" with Nepalese banks, the balances of which may be freely transferred abroad. Indian nationals are allowed to open current accounts in Indian rupees with Nepalese banks. Foreign currencies brought into or received in Nepal by non- residents, which are converted into Nepalese rupees and de- posited with a Nepalese bank, may be reconverted for transfer out of the country, subject to prior permission of the Nepal Rastra Bank. Imports and Import Payments All imports of goods except those originating in India (other than alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and most tobacco products) or the Tibet region require import licenses from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Imports of vegetables, vegetable oil, margarine, animal fat, beef, arms and ammuni- tion, explosives, chemicals to be used for explosives, and wireless transmitters are prohibited. Under the Trade and Transit Treaty of August 13, 1971, Nepal and India agreed to freedom of trade between themselves in Nepalese and Indian goods; Indian goods may be imported freely, and reimbursement of tax is made by the Government of India to the Government of Nepal on direct imports from Indian manufacturers of commodities subject to excise du ty in India. With the exception noted below, applications to the Minis- try of Finance for foreign exchange to pay for imports from countries other than India are considered on their merits; any application must, however, be in accordance with the annual foreign exchange budget. Exporters entitled to import goods with exporters' exchange entitlements are, within the limits of their entitlement, granted a license automatically for goods specified by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (see section on Exports and Export Proceeds, below); the entitle- ments are transferable and may also be used by other holders. No licenses for consumer goods are being issued to the private sector (other than hotels) except against exporters' exchange entitlements. Many imports payable in convertible currencies are effected through state trading agencies, mainly the Na- tional Trading Ltd. and the Agricultural Marketing Corpora- tion. Certain imports from all sources are subject to import surcharges. Payments for Invisibles Payments to India may be made freely in Indian rupees, but for purchases of Rs 500 or over the purpose of the payment must be indicated. Payments for freight and insurance are given the same treatment as the related import payments. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution For travel to countries other than India for medical treat- ment, foreign exchange is allowed as recommended by a panel of doctors; students studying at their own expense in these countries are allowed up to US$2,160 a year for board and lodging, while payments for tuition fees are allowed as re- quired. Payments for other invisibles depend on the essential- ity of the transaction and the availability of foreign exchange. Ncpalese and Indian currency may be taken out freely to India by Nepalese and Indian nationals only; the export of these currencies to countries other than India is prohibited. Foreign banknotes other than Indian banknotes may not be taken out by residents without permission. Nonresidents may take out the unchanged amount of any foreign banknotes they brought in; however, nonresidents other than Indian nationals may not take out Nepalese or Indian banknotes. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of old coins, gold and silver, and coins and jewelry made of these metals, cows, buffaloes, and rhinoceros horns are prohibited. The re-export to India of non-Nepalese goods is not permitted, and re-exports to any destination of goods imported from India are prohibited. All other goods may be exported freely to India. All exports to other destinations require export licenses. The exchange proceeds of exports, except Indian rupees, must be surrendered to the Nepal Rastra Bank or an autho- rized bank at the official buying rate of exchange, within six months of shipment. The exporter receives from the Nepal Rastra Bank an exporters' exchange entitlement correspond- ing to a specified proportion of his export proceeds in foreign currencies other than Indian rupees; the entitlement may be used to obtain exchange at the official rate for the import of goods specified by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Entitlements are negotiable. Exporters engaged in bilateral trade, i.e., those selling to countries with which Nepal maintains payments agreements, are granted entitlements corresponding to 100 per cent of their export earnings; 40 per cent may be used for imports of their choice from the partner country concerned and the re- maining 60 per cent must be used to import specified com- modities from the partner country concerned. When expxOrts are made to convertible currency countries, exchange entitlements are granted at ratios ranging from 20 per cent for raw jute to 90 per cent for stainless steel goods. Proceeds from Invisibles With the exception of Indian rupees, foreign exchange pro- ceeds derived from transactions in invisibles must be surren- dered to the Nepal Rastra Bank or an authorized bank at the official rate of exchange. Nepalese and Indian currency may be brought in from India only, and by Nepalese and Indian nationals only; the import of these currencies from countries other than India is prohibited. Nonresidents other than Indian nationals are not allowed to bring in Nepalese or Indian banknotes. Other foreign banknotes may be brought NEPAL in freely by residents and nonresidents, but residents must declare any foreign banknotes they bring in. Capital No conditions are laid down concerning receipts and remit- tances in respect of capital transactions, but official exchange is not normally provided for capital remittances by Nepalese nationals. Nepalese citizens, whether resident in Nepal or not, are prohibited from making any type of investment in foreign countries except investment specifically exempted by govern- ment notice published in the Official Gazette; the exemptions include the purchase and sale of insurance policies abroad, investments abroad by any banking or financial institution incorporated in Nepal, and the purchase of shares of foreign companies under a rights issue. Foreign investors in Nepal who obtain an investment guar- antee may remit yearly profits of up to 25 per cent of the total profit on the foreign capital invested and, in any one year, up to 10 per cent of the principal; if the exchange situation permits, profits in excess of 25 per cent are remittable. Enter- prises capitalized at NRs 500,000 or more may be wholly owned by nonresidents. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form in Nepal. Imports for industrial and handicraft use from India, at Indian gold prices, are free of license. No import licenses for gold are issued under the Exporters' Exchange Entitlement Scheme. Imports of gold from any country other than India require a license and are subject to an import duty of NRs 6.65 a troy ounce; such imports are not normally allowed. Exports of gold may be made only by the monetary authorities and require prior approval by the Ministry of Finance. Domestic dealings in gold do not require a license but are subject to sales tax at 10 per cent. Changes during 1973 January 1. The National Trading Ltd. took over all exports of raw jute. February 20. Nepal established a central rate of NRs 12.7390 = SDR 1, corresponding to NRs 10.56 = US$1. Previously, the Nepal Rastra Bank's fixed buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were NRs 10.10 and NRs 10.20, respectively, per US$1. The parity rate for the Indian rupee was maintained unchanged at NRs 139.10 per 100 Indian rupees. Nepal continued to avail itself of wider mar- gins. April 13. The entitlement percentages under the Export- ers' Exchange Entitlement Scheme were revised. April 23. The transfer of exporters' exchange entitlements was freely permitted. August 17. The state-owned Nepal Oil Corporation took over the import and distribution of petroleum products. November 30. Further amendments to the Exporters' Ex- change Entitlement Scheme came into effect. 311 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NETHERLANDS Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.245489 gram of fine gold per Nether- lands Guilder, corresponding to f. 3.62 = SDR 1. The Neth- erlands has established a central rate of f. 3.35507 = SDR 1, corresponding to 0.264874 gram of fine gold per Netherlands guilder, and avails itself of wider margins. A maximum mar- gin of 2% per cent is maintained for exchange rates in the official market between the Netherlands guilder and the Dan- ish krone, the deutsche mark, the French franc, the Norwe- gian krone, and the Swedish krona; margins of 1V2 per cent either side of the cross-parity are observed for the Belgian franc and, by implication, the Luxembourg franc (BF /Lux F 100 = f. 6.8953). No announced margins are maintained for other currencies. l The authorized banks' buying and sell- ing rates for the U.S. dollar on December 31, 1973 were f. 2.82325 and f. 2.82575, respectively, per US$1. Authorized banks are freely permitted to buy and sell con- vertible and inconvertible currencies, both spot and forward, against convertible currencies, including guilders on Convert- ible Guilder Accounts, and inconvertible currencies; they are free to deal with residents and nonresidents, whether banks or nonbanks. Forward exchange contracts are not limited as to delivery period nor is an underlying transaction required. Residents are permitted to conclude spot transactions with other residents, including authorized banks, and they may conclude forward transactions for any period with authorized banks. Nonbank residents are free to hold foreign currency accounts at home and on application are permitted to hold such accounts (normally demand deposits only) in their own names with banks abroad. The guilder proceeds from the sale by nonresidents to resi- dents of officially listed guilder bonds (O-guilders, see section on Capital, below) are traded in a spot market at free rates. On December 31, 1973, the rate for the O-guilder was about f. 100.50 per 100 O-guilders. 2 The Kingdom of the Netherlands formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from February 15, 1961. Exchange Control Territory All transactions with the Netherlands Antilles and Suri- nam are subject to exchange control, although they are gener- ally permitted freely. Vis-a-vis any third countries with which payments agreements might be in force, the Netherlands, the Netherlands Antilles, and Surinam constitute the Nether- lands Monetary Area. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Netherlands Bank on behalf of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Eco- 1 The currencies quoted in the Amsterdam market include Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. 2 The O-guilder arrangements were abolished with effect from February 1, 1974. 312 nomic Affairs, and Agriculture. Import and export licensing are handled by the Central Import-Export Agency (CDIU) and the delegated offices, under directives from the Director- ate-General for Foreign Economic Relations. Invisibles and capital transactions are licensed by the Netherlands Bank, as are transit trade transactions, except those in strategic goods and scrap, which are licensed by the CDIU. 3 All commercial banks of any importance are authorized to handle foreign exchange transactions within the scope of general and special licenses granted by the licensing authorities. Prescription of Currency Payments to nonresidents, if eligible for transfer abroad, must be made through an authorized bank, either in guilders to the credit of a nonresident guilder account held with an authorized bank in the Netherlands or to the debit of the authorized bank's currency holdings abroad. There are spe- cial regulations, however, for settlements with nonresidents in respect of officially listed guilder bonds (see section on Capi- tal, below) and for payments in respect of direct imports from Egypt. Since there are no bilateral payments agreements, all for- eign countries are included in the "convertible guilder area." Payments to countries in the convertible guilder area may be made in any foreign currency or in guilders to the credit of any nonresident account. Receipts from countries in the con- vertible guilder area may be obtained in any convertible cur- rency or in guilders to the debit of a Convertible Guilder Account (see section on Nonresident Accounts, below); how- ever, receipts may also be collected in other currencies, pro- vided that the amounts received are deposited with the Netherlands Bank or an authorized bank. Payments between residents may be made freely in any foreign currency, provided that the amount involved is deb- ited to a foreign currency account in the Netherlands or abroad and is credited to a foreign currency account in the name of the beneficiary with an authorized bank in the Neth- erlands. Nonresident Accounts The main categories of nonresident guilder accounts are as follows: 1. Convertible Guilder Accounts. These accounts may be held by any nonresident. They may be credited with transfers from other Convertible Guilder Accounts, with permitted payments by residents of the Netherlands to residents of countries of the convertible guilder area, with proceeds from the sale of gold or convertible currencies, and with Nether- lands notes and coins remitted or deposited by nonresidents. They may be debited for payments to residents for exports and services rendered to any country and for other permitted transactions, including purchases of foreign currencies. How- 3 Merchanting transactions involving Rhodesia are prohibited. Most other transactions are freely permitted by virtue of general licenses granted to registered transit traders. The only merchanting transactions still subject to a specific license are purchases and sales of strategic goods and, within the EEC, of scrap. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ever, Convertible Guilder Accounts held by Rhodesians may not be debited or credited without special licenses, which generally are refused. Convertible Guilder Accounts may not be debited for the purchase of officially listed guilder bonds, Netherlands treasury paper, or guilder bank acceptances; they may not be credited with interest on demand deposits, 4 and may be subject to a negative interest charge (the rate of charge was zero per cent at the end of 1973). Balances on these accounts may be transferred to any other nonresident account except O-Guilder Accounts. No time or savings de- posits may be established on Convertible Guilder Accounts. 5 2. O-Guilder Accounts(see footnote 2). These accounts may be held by any nonresident and by those authorized banks and stockbrokers that have been designated authorized de- positories. The accounts may be freely credited with (1) the guilder proceeds from the sale of officially listed guilder bonds by nonresidents to residents,6 and (2) amounts trans- ferred from other O-Guilder Accounts. They may be freely debited for (1) purchases of officially listed guilder bonds by nonresidents from residents, (2) amounts transferred to other O-Guilder Accounts, and (3) transfers to Convertible Guilder Accounts. Holders of O-guilders may freely sell these to other nonresidents or to resident banks and stockbrokers, for for- eign currency or convertible guilders. Imports and Import Payments Imports from the Belgian-Luxembourg Economic Union are free from import licenses. Imports from Rhodesia are prohibited. Import licenses are required for imports originat- ing in Hong Kong, Japan, and state trading countries, and for the import of goods of unknown origin. In addition, import licenses are required for a limited number of products mainly from the agricultural and textile sectors. Except for imports from Rhodesia, practically all imports that require an import license are free from quantitative restriction. Most imports from Eastern European countries are formally liberalized. Commodities corresponding to some 19 tariff headings or subheadings are subject to quantitative restriction when orig- inating in Japan. Imports from non-EEC countries of most products cov- ered by the Common Agricultural Policy of the EEC are subject to import levies that have replaced all previous barri- ers to imports; common EEC regulations are also applied to imports from non-EEC countries of most other agricultural and livestock products, some of which are subject to variable import levies. Payments for imports may be made freely, provided that the method of payment conforms with the general prescrip- tion of currency regulations. Residents may freely grant credit in respect of imports of commodities,7 but they require prior approval from the Netherlands Bank to accept credit for 4 Balances up to f. 50,000 held by physical persons are exempt from this prohibition. With effect from March 4, 1974 the exemption was increased to f. 100,000 a person. 5 With effect from March 4, 1974 this prohibition was lifted for physical persons, up to f. 100,000 a person. 6 Emigrants must be able to show that they have owned these bonds since a date at least three months prior to departure. 7 Commodities are so defined as to exclude gold. NETHERLANDS periods in excess of those traditional in the trade concerned; such permission is not normally granted. Payments for Invisibles Payments abroad for invisibles are permitted freely. Ex- change for travel is provided in any currency and up to any amount, and the entire amount may be taken, if the traveler wishes, in Netherlands banknotes. A resident traveling abroad may in addition have any further amounts remitted to him through banking channels. Exchange purchased for travel purposes must not be spent for other purposes; it may be used for purchases for personal use, however. Payments for interest, dividends, and contractual amortization due to non- residents are permitted freely by crediting the appropriate nonresident account. The export of domestic or foreign banknotes by resident travelers is not subject to limitation. Nonresidents may ex- port all unutilized negotiable instruments and foreign and Netherlands banknotes and coins which they have imported or have obtained in the Netherlands by drawing on their accounts or exchanging other currencies. Exports and Export Proceeds Virtually all exports to Rhodesia are prohibited; those which are permitted require an export license. For exports to other countries, export licenses are required only for a few commodities, mostly of a strategic character, and for some agricultural products, scrap of iron and steel, certain nonfer- rous metals, and petroleum. Residents may freely grant credit in respect of exports of commodities (see footnote 7), but they require prior permis- sion from the Netherlands Bank to accept payment in ad- vance of delivery where such advance payments are not traditional in the trade concerned; such permission is not normally granted. The surrender of export proceeds is not obligatory, but any surrender that is made must be at the official rate. The collection of export proceeds through an authorized bank is obligatory. A license may be obtained on application, however, to hold a foreign currency account with a bank abroad, to which account export proceeds may be credited. Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles must be collected through an authorized bank but need not be surrendered and may instead be credited to foreign currency accounts. A li- cense may be obtained on application to hold a foreign cur- rency account with a bank abroad, to which account proceeds from invisibles may be credited. For incoming exchange ex- ceeding f. 1,000 derived from current invisibles, the recipient must indicate to an authorized bank the nature of the under- lying transaction, as well as the amount and currency re- ceived. Nonresidents may bring into the Netherlands unlimited amounts in Netherlands banknotes, foreign banknotes, and negotiable instruments. These may be sold only to an autho- rized bank, to an authorized exchange office, or, in the case 313 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NETHERLANDS of foreign banknotes, to an authorized depository, or they may be used to pay tourist expenses in the Netherlands. Residents are obliged to bring back to the Netherlands any unutilized portion of the banknotes and coins that they took with them on their outward journey; there is no limitation on the amount in Netherlands or foreign banknotes and coins that they may bring in. Capital Inward and outward capital transfers and the shifting of foreign-owned capital within the Netherlands from one asset to another are subject to control, but general licenses have been granted for many types of capital transaction. Borrow- ing and lending abroad by bank and nonbank residents (with the exception of specified banking operations and of the granting of credit in respect of imports or exports of commod- ities) are restricted for reasons of capital market policy and, as far as borrowing is concerned, either to control the con- tracting of foreign debt by local authorities or for reasons of monetary and reserve policy. Apart from guilder issues on the Netherlands capital market (see below), most lending to non- residents is liberally permitted. Borrowing abroad by non- bank residents is at present restricted, in principle, to amounts used for investments abroad (which is considered to include the purchase of ships and aircraft abroad). Borrowing from nonresident banks by private industry and other non- bank residents is not normally permitted, and loans from other nonresident sources (except suppliers' credits with a maturity customary in the trade concerned) are subject to individual approval; licenses for borrowing abroad from non- bank nonresidents are granted on application, provided that the funds are used for direct investment abroad or for lending to nonresidents, but the Netherlands Bank, in principle, does not permit nonbank residents to take up financial credits abroad other than loans with a fixed maturity of at least five years from nonresident enterprises belonging to the same concern as the borrower. There is a general license for loans up to f. 100,000 taken up by residents from nonresidents, provided that a resident in any calendar year does not borrow more than f. 100,000 from the same nonresident. A similar license has been issued for lending to nonresidents. Further- more, a general license permits authorized banks to grant loans for up to 12 months to nonbank nonresidents and for any period to nonresident banks; authorized banks are on application granted licenses to lend to nonbank nonresidents for periods in excess of 12 months. Special regulations exist for borrowing and lending be- tween head offices (in the Netherlands or abroad) of multina- tional companies and their branches and subsidiaries; at present, the Netherlands Bank does not permit financial loans to be taken up abroad within a multinational company, ex- cept as indicated above or by resident subsidiaries located in regions where industrialization is being promoted by means of premiums. Nonbank residents are not normally permitted to purchase foreign treasury bills or other foreign short-term instruments. Purchases of Netherlands treasury paper and guilder bank acceptances by nonresidents, including central banks, are prohibited. Capital transactions, whether freely 314 permitted or not, must be notified to the Balance of Payments Department of the Netherlands Bank; this is true also of all import credit in excess of one year and of advance payments in excess of f. 250,000 to be received for exports. Capital issues in the Netherlands on behalf of nonresidents are restricted. During the last ten years or so, international financial institutions and the authorities of the nonmetropoli- tan areas of the Kingdom of the Netherlands have been the only nonresidents allowed to make bond issues denominated in guilders. Such issues are individually licensed by the Neth- erlands Bank in accordance with the prospects for the domes- tic capital market and the balance of payments. The Netherlands Bank, subject to certain conditions, allows non- residents access to the debt certificate sector of the domestic capital market (the market for onderhandse leningeri). Autho- rized banks may on request be licensed to lead syndicates for the issue of medium-term Euro-guilder notes, the proceeds of which normally must not be spent in the Netherlands. Unless special permission to the contrary is obtained from the Netherlands Bank, authorized banks' foreign liabilities must not exceed their foreign claims, i.e., they are not allowed to maintain a negative net external position. In observing this regulation, each bank has a leeway of f. 5 million; the calcula- tion of the net foreign position is based on the foreign position in all currencies, including guilders, and on the sum of short-term and long-term assets and liabilities. Subject to this limitation, banks may freely accept demand deposits from nonresidents, in domestic or foreign currency, as well as time deposits in foreign currency. However, subject to minor ex- emptions for physical persons, banks are prohibited from paying interest on nonresident-held guilder demand deposits and from accepting guilder time deposits from nonresidents. New capital investments in the Netherlands by nonresi- dents are in general permitted. Inward direct investment is freely permitted and local borrowing by nonresident-owned or nonresident-controlled companies for use in the Nether- lands also is freely permitted. The transfer abroad of the proceeds from the sale or liquidation of nonresident invest- ments in industrial enterprises and other businesses estab- lished in the Netherlands is freely permitted. Nonresidents may freely purchase real estate in the Netherlands for per- sonal use or investment. Direct investment abroad by resi- dents is authorized on application. Transactions between residents and nonresidents in offi- cially listed guilder bonds (including mortgage bonds and "interest savings letters" but excluding guilder notes) are sub- ject to special regulations (but see footnote 2). Trading in such bonds is unrestricted but nonresidents' purchases from residents must be financed with O-guilders (see Nonresident Accounts, above); nonresidents selling such bonds to resi- dents may receive payment by credit either to an O-Guilder Account or to a Convertible Guilder Account. Accrued inter- est and brokerage on bonds purchased and sold must be settled in the same manner as the principal sum, as must stamp duty on transactions in the secondary market. Bal- ances in O-Guilder Accounts are freely negotiable between nonresidents. Authorized banks and stockbrokers may freely deal in O-guilders among themselves and with nonresidents. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Transactions between residents and nonresidents in foreign securities and domestic securities other than listed guilder bonds take place at official market rates and, with minor exceptions, are unrestricted; the regulations concerning secu- rities are not applicable to treasury bills or certificates of deposit. Residents may freely purchase officially listed securi- ties abroad, with the exception of guilder-denominated Euro-bonds issued by nonresidents; foreign bonds denomi- nated in guilders or otherwise linked to the parity of the guilder may be purchased freely only when listed on the Amsterdam stock exchange. The foreign currency proceeds from securities sold abroad by residents must be deposited with an authorized bank or securities broker in the Nether- lands and may be sold or retained. The proceeds of securities sold in the Netherlands by nonresidents (other than O-guilder proceeds) are transferable in any currency, irrespective of the seller's country of domicile or residence. Nonresidents may have their securities, Netherlands or foreign, exported to them; for the exportation of listed guilder bonds an individual authorization is required, which is granted upon application. Domestic and foreign securities held abroad by a resident are subject to a deposit requirement, but the Netherlands Bank grants exemptions on application; securities held in the Neth- erlands are not subject to deposit. Residents may freely purchase real estate abroad. Gifts and donations to nonresidents are free. 8 Emigrants may export any amount in foreign and domestic currency. They acquire the status of nonresidents upon leaving the Netherlands, pro- vided that they have declared their intention to settle abroad for more than three years, and may upon departure have remitted to them their total assets in the Netherlands; the proceeds of any listed guilder bonds sold by emigrants to residents do not qualify for settlement in O-guilders unless the bonds had been held for at least three months prior to departure (but see footnote 2). Payments to nonresident beneficiaries may be made freely in respect of inheritances from estates being distributed in the Netherlands. Gold The Netherlands Bank engages in gold transactions only with monetary authorities and international financial institu- tions. Neither the Bank nor any government agency imports or markets gold for industrial use. Authorized banks and other residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold (fine gold, gold coin, and gold alloys) in the Netherlands or abroad; gold held abroad, however, must be kept on deposit with the foreign correspondent of an authorized depository. Imports and exports of gold require neither exchange licenses nor import and export licenses. There is a free gold market in Amsterdam. Domestic sales of gold coins, if legal tender in the country of issue, are free of value-added tax; those that are not legal tender are subject to value-added tax at 4 per cent. The value-added tax on medallions and commemorative coins is 16 per cent; sales of gold bars and nuggets are exempt. Commercial imports of gold jewelry and of articles con tain- 8 Charitable gifts and donations for religious purposes are included in the Netherlands definition of current payments. NETHERLANDS ing minor quantities of gold, such as watches, require import licenses only when originating in Hong Kong, Japan, or state trading countries. Changes during 1973 January 1. The import regime applicable to EEC member countries became applicable to Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, except for goods covered by common mar- ket organizations of the EEC, for which this occurred on February 1. January 1. The rate of value-added tax applicable to gold medallions and commemorative gold coins was increased from 14 per cent to 16 per cent. January 1. Silver coins ceased to be legal tender and the restriction on their exportation by travelers was revoked. January 1. Export credit insurance facilities were further improved. January 3. Residents were allowed to subscribe to new issues by residents of Euro-guilder notes. Previously, they could only acquire such notes in the secondary market, after placing. January 11. The special regulations concerning certain bal- ances and securities belonging to residents of Indonesia were revoked. These had involved W-accounts, W-deposits, and certain foreign currency accounts. January 17. The issuance of import licenses for "entertain- ment electronics devices" of Japanese origin was suspended. February 12. The exchange market was closed. It reopened on February 14. February 14. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the Netherlands maintained its central rate in terms of gold and SDRs. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously f. 3.2447 = US$1, became f. 2.92024 = US$1, corresponding to f. 3.52282 = SDR 1. The new intervention limits for the U.S. dollar were f. 2.8545 and f. 2.9860, and those for the Belgian franc f. 0.07132 and f. 0.07349. March 1. The Netherlands Bank repeated its request to banks for strict compliance with the "5-million-guilder regu- lation." The banks were asked in future to report not only their end-of-month positions under the regulation but also their mid-month positions. A bank that exceeded the 5-mil- lion-guilder limit was obliged to maintain a special noninter- est-bearing deposit with the Netherlands Bank to the amount of the excess. March 2. The exchange market was closed. It reopened on March 19. March 16. It was announced that with effect from March 26 authorized banks and authorized depositories would be required to charge a special commission (negative interest) on any increases in balances in Convertible Guilder Accounts over the average credit balance in the period Febru- ary 1-February 14, 1973. Exempt were balances up to f. 100,000 held by physical persons, associations, societies, trusts, and foundations (up to f. 10,000 for accounts opened on or after March 30, 1973). The commission, to be trans- ferred monthly to the Netherlands Bank, was initially set by the Netherlands Bank at V4 of 1 per cent a week, but could 315 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NETHERLANDS be set at any level up to 2 per cent a week. With effect from May 7, it was reduced to zero per cent. March 19. The Netherlands henceforth maintained mar- gins of up to 2% per cent in exchange transactions in the official market between the Netherlands guilder and the Dan- ish krone, the deutsche mark, the French franc, the Norwe- gian krone, and the Swedish krona; margins of up to 1 % per cent either side of the cross-parity continued to be observed for the Belgian franc and the Luxembourg franc. No an- nounced margins would be maintained for other currencies. The intervention limits for the U.S. dollar were revoked. March 27. The Netherlands Bank announced it had reached agreement with the authorized banks on the intro- duction of an ad hoc, noninterest-bearing cash reserve re- quirement against increases in banks' foreign guilder liabilities since December 31, 1972 or, at their option, since January 31, 1973. The reserve requirement was initially set at 50 per cent, applicable to the week ending April 4. It was canceled with effect from May 3. April 1. Authorized banks charged a handling fee of f. 25 a quarter, payable in advance, on all Convertible Guilder Accounts subject to the commission introduced on March 26. They discontinued the fee with effect from May 7. April 12. Joint Benelux measures were announced aiming at regulating the import from Japan of certain electronic products, including radios and television sets. Imports of such products from all non-EEC countries were placed under license on June 20. The restrictions were lifted after the sign- ing of an agreement between Benelux and Japan on Decem- ber 18. June. The Netherlands Bank resumed intervention opera- tions in the O-Guilder market, in order to prevent the pre- mium from exceeding 5% per cent. These operations were discontinued in August. July 2. The amount up to which payments to, and receipts from, nonresidents were exempt from the submission of an exchange control form was increased from f. 500 to f. 1,000. July 3. The physical exportation by authorized depositories of listed guilder bonds owned by residents was prohibited unless an individual license was obtained, which would be granted on application; previously, the exportation of nonres- ident-owned equities and bonds, domestic or foreign, was covered by a general license. July 13. Liquidity reserve arrangements for banks were announced. The liquidity reserve for each bank, to be held mainly in the form of Treasury paper, comprised a stated percentage of its short-term domestic liabilities plus a stated percentage of its long-term liabilities. For purposes of these arrangements, commercial banks' net foreign assets were not considered liquidities. Included among the liquidities subject to the new arrangements were balances held with the Nether- lands Bank, minus any fixed deposits or balances in S Ac- counts to be held with the Bank as a result of the application of the "5-million-guilder regulation." Foreign currency swaps specifically identified as liquidity by the Netherlands Bank could be included among the liquidities subject to the ar- rangement. July 16. For the implementation of an indemnification agreement with Egypt of February 25, 1971 it was prescribed 316 that 50 per cent of payments for direct imports from that country of commodities other than rice, raw cotton, and crude petroleum had to be made by credit to a special guilder account held by the Central Bank of Egypt with the Nether- lands Bank. 9 August 23. The coverage of the export financing arrange- ment between the Netherlands Bank and the authorized banks was increased from f. 600 million to f. 800 million. August 29. The Netherlands Bank curbed the recourse of the banking system to its advances and discount facility at the official interest rates. Limits on the average recourse during the period from the beginning of September 1973 to the end of February 1974 were set, which were related to each bank's volume of business; for recourse in excess of the limit a penalty commission of Y4 of 1 per cent a month was charged. This action was taken in part because international interest arbitrage had resulted in the financing of the commercial banks' net foreign assets by the Netherlands Bank. On Octo- ber 16 the penalty commission was reduced to % of 1 per cent a month. On December 13 the Netherlands Bank imposed a further curb on excessive recourse to its facilities by charging an additional penalty commission for recourse in excess of 75 per cent of the limit. This additional commission was initially set at ys of 1 per cent a month. It was halved with effect from December 24. September 1. The amount up to which balances in Convert- ible Guilder Accounts held by physical persons could bear interest was increased from f. 25,000 to f. 50,000 per person. The amount up to which nonresident physical persons could establish savings or time deposits with authorized banks also was increased from f. 25,000 to f. 50,000. September 17. The Netherlands established a central rate of f. 1 = SDR 0.298056 (f. 3.35507 = SDR 1), equivalent to 0.264874 gram of fine gold per Netherlands guilder. The 2% per cent and 1 % per cent margin arrangements were con- tinued. September 19. Measures were taken to prevent emigrating residents from obtaining the O-guilder premium on their guil- der bond holdings in an irregular manner. Previously, emi- grants acquired nonresident status upon departure and could immediately transfer all their assets abroad. Henceforth, emi- grants during the first three months of their residence abroad could not sell any listed guilder bonds in the Netherlands except against payment to the credit of a Convertible Guilder Account (i.e., at the official market rate of exchange), unless they could show they had owned the bonds at least three months prior to departure. September 26. The Netherlands Bank undertook swap transactions with the authorized banks, purchasing U.S. dol- lars spot and immediately reselling them forward. By October 6, when this policy was discontinued, the swaps amounted to f. 1.2 billion. In the first half of November expiring swaps totaling about f. 0.4 billion were renewed. Additional swaps were offered from December 13; as a result, the amount out- standing rose by f. 1.6 billion to f. 2.5 billion on Decem- ber 31. 9 This arrangement will be terminated when f. 6 million has been so credited. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NETHERLANDS October 1. An exchange risk insurance facility on long-term contracts for capital goods exports was reintroduced; the minimum maturity was two years and exchange losses of 3 per cent or less had to be borne by the exporter. October 17. The Netherlands Bank offered U.S. Treasury bills to authorized banks showing a liquidity shortage in excess of a specified amount; this paper was included in the prescribed minimum liquidity reserve. Sales were about f. 60 million in October and about f. 350 million in November. October 22 Exports of the principal petroleum products were made subject to licensing. On November 19 the measure was extended to crude petroleum and to crude oils derived from bituminous minerals. Decembers. The Law Concerning Settlements with Rhode- sia came into force. It prohibited, except when a license was granted, all financial transactions, whether direct or indirect, between the Netherlands and Rhodesia. December 19. Authorized banks were informed that the Netherlands Bank was prepared again to consider applica- tions from residents for authorization to take up financial credits with a fixed maturity of at least five years from nonres- ident enterprises belonging to the same concern. 317 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NETHERLANDS ANTILLES Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.471230 gram of fine gold per Nether- lands Antilles Guilder. l The gold content of the currency has been established at 0.411543 gram of fine gold. The central rate is Ant. f. 1.79000 per US$1, corresponding to Ant. f. 2.15936 = SDR 1, and the Netherlands Antilles avails itself of wider margins. The intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. Exchange transactions between commercial banks and the public take place at Ant. f. 1.79 buying, and Ant. f. 1.81 selling, per US$1, plus a tax of %0 of 1 per cent on sales of exchange, making the effective selling rate for the U.S. dollar Ant. f. 1.8245 per US$1.2 The official buying and selling rates for certain other currencies are set daily on the basis of rates for the U.S. dollar abroad. The Bank of the Netherlands Antilles (the central bank) deals with commercial banks at interbank rates. The Bank does not normally deal with the public. Commercial banks require the approval of the central bank to invest or hold foreign currency balances. 3 Administration of Control Exchange licenses, where required, are issued by the central bank. Import licenses are issued by the Department of Econ- omy. The commercial banks are permitted by the central bank to provide foreign exchange for most current transac- tions without prior approval. The central bank may grant an exemption from the obligation of surrendering foreign ex- change, insofar as the assets or moneys concerned were ac- quired from nonresidents and are not being held in favor of or on behalf of, or for the account of, third parties who are residents; the foreign exchange may then be held or used freely until further notice or until revocation by the central bank. Prescription of Currency Payments may be made in any currency except Nether- lands Antilles guilders. Receipts may be accepted in any convertible currency except Netherlands Antilles guilders. For statistical purposes, all payments made by residents through the authorized banks in foreign exchange must be reported to the central bank. Nonresident Accounts an account desirable; balances in such accounts may not without central bank approval exceed Ant. f. 10,000. Imports and Import Payments Imports of certain items, such as narcotics and explosives, are subject to license for public policy reasons. Imports into the islands of Aruba, Bonaire, and Curacao of nonvacuum- packed cereals (other than rice), certain wheat meal and wheat flour, certain fodder and fodder concentrates, and cer- tain other commodities, including alcoholic beverages, ciga- rettes, Pharmaceuticals, cement, and new or used automobiles, require a prior import license issued by the De- partment of Economy; for price control purposes only, some other goods are subject to licensing upon customs clearance. Payments for permitted imports may be made freely. Compa- nies with nonresident status normally finance their imports with their own foreign exchange. Payments for Invisibles Payments for current invisibles are not restricted. For most types of current invisibles remittances may be made freely through the authorized banks. Licenses are required, how- ever, for the purchase of travel exchange in excess of Ant. f. 180 a person for each day to be spent abroad and for certain personal remittances in excess of Ant. f. 2,500 each or in excess of Ant. f. 10,000 a person a year. Such licenses are freely granted when no illegal capital transfer seems to be involved. For payments representing interest on loans or net income from other investments, and for amortization of loans or depreciation of direct investments, licenses are granted on application, subject to verification of the facts. Nonresidents may take with them on departure any foreign currency which they brought in on arrival. The export of Netherlands Antilles banknotes is limited to Ant. f. 200 a person. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports require licenses, which are usually granted. Exchange proceeds must be surrendered to an authorized bank within six months of shipment, with the exception of export proceeds received by companies with nonresident sta- tus. Nonresidents may freely open nonresident accounts in any foreign currency. Nonresidents (including foreign investment funds, etc., with nonresident status) are permitted to hold nonresident accounts in Netherlands Antilles guilders only if the authorized bank concerned considers that they have cer- tain interests in the Netherlands Antilles which render such 1 In the islands of Saba, St. Eustatius, and St. Maarten, the Netherlands Antilles guilder and the U.S. dollar circulate concurrently. 2 Foreign exchange purchased by resident companies with nonresident status for exchange control purposes is exempt from the exchange tax. 3 All currencies other than the Netherlands Antilles guilder are considered foreign currencies. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange receipts from invisibles (except those of firms with nonresident status) must in principle be surren- dered to an authorized bank within eight days of receipt, but in practice the public is allowed to hold foreign banknotes and coins, since the domestic currency and the U.S. dollar circulate concurrently. Travelers may bring with them checks, travelers checks, or banknotes in foreign currency in unlimited amounts. Each traveler may also bring in Ant. f. 200 in Netherlands Antilles banknotes. 318 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Capital Foreign investment in the Netherlands Antilles requires a license, which is, in general, granted if the investment is in the economic and social interest of the islands; the Investment Incentives Program, as amended, provides for duty-free entry of many commodities as well as tax facilities. New industrial companies primarily engaged in exporting may be granted nonresident status by the central bank, which confers on the company concerned exemption from exchange control (ex- cept in its transactions with residents), including exemption from the requirement of surrendering their foreign currency receipts. Such exemption may also be granted to investment companies, patent holding companies, shipping companies, and insurance companies. Outward flows of resident-owned capital are subject to control, and certain capital transactions by or on behalf of residents are restricted. Life insurance contracts between resi- dents and foreign insurance companies for a minimum term of ten years are licensed freely up to an amount which is fixed annually, depending on the foreign exchange position. Invest- ment by residents in real estate situated abroad requires a license. Investment in foreign securities (i.e., securities issued outside the Netherlands Antilles or payable or optionally payable in the currency of a country other than the Nether- lands Antilles) requires a license only when exceeding Ant. f. 2,500 a transaction or Ant. f. 10,000 a person a year. Investments by residents in officially quoted foreign securities (other than shares in mutual funds, investment in which is not permitted) are licensed freely up to amounts fixed annually, depending on the foreign exchange position. In considering applications by such residents as pension funds and other institutional investors, the central bank takes into account the merits of each case and, in particular, the limited opportunity for domestic investment; the bank may exert moral suasion, however, to discourage excessive outflows of resident-owned capital. Authorized banks may freely borrow foreign currency abroad from nonresidents (including residents with nonresi- dent status), or accept foreign currency deposits from nonres- NETHERLANDS ANTILLES idents, for relending to nonresidents or redeposit abroad; their borrowing from nonresidents for relending to residents is restricted for monetary policy reasons and banks require central bank approval to incur a net foreign liability position. Nonresidents are not normally permitted to acquire balances in Netherlands Antilles guilders. Local borrowing in domes- tic currency by nonresidents (including resident companies regarded as nonresidents for exchange control purposes) is restricted. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in the Nether- lands Antilles for numismatic and investment purposes; au- thorized banks may freely negotiate gold coins among themselves and with other residents. Residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed without special permission to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry or coins, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the central bank; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports of coins by authorized banks, and for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. Changes during 1973 February 15. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the Netherlands Antilles commu- nicated to the Fund a central rate of Ant. f. 1.79000 = US$1 and continued to avail itself of wider margins. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar remained unchanged, since the central rate established on December 23, 1971 was Ant. f. 1.79 = US$1. The gold content of the currency was changed from 0.457270 gram to 0.411543 gram of fine gold. April 17. The central bank raised the ceiling on the com- mercial banks' net foreign assets. September 25. For price control purposes only, certain commodities were made subject in Aruba, Bonaire, and Cura- cao to an import licensing requirement applicable at the time of customs clearance. 319 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NEW ZEALAND Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.99531 gram of fine gold per New Zealand Dollar, corresponding to $NZ 0.892857 = SDR 1, and New Zealand avails itself of wider margins. However, since July 9, 1973 no announced margins have been observed. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand adjusts the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar daily so as to maintain a given effective relationship between the New Zealand dollar and the curren- cies of the main trading partners. Except for the Australian dollar and the Fiji dollar, the rates for spot transactions in other currencies quoted by the New Zealand trading (com- mercial) banks, including the pound sterling, are based on the closing buying and selling rates of the previous day in Lon- don. The banks' buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar on December 31, 1973 were US$1.4349 and US$1.4219 per $NZ 1. The trading banks are permitted to conclude with their customers forward exchange contracts in U.S. and Canadian dollars and sterling for up to 12 months to cover trade trans- actions. Forward transactions in sterling and Canadian dol- lars take place at rates of exchange based on the closing buying and selling rates of the previous day in London. For- ward exchange contracts written in U.S. dollars are con- cluded at the relative spot rates, adjusted with a loading of US$0.0020 a mon th on contracts covering exports. U.S. dol- lar forward contracts covering imports are concluded at a loading of US$0.0005 on the spot rate. The Reserve Bank provides a facility whereby trading banks may obtain day-to-day cover for their net positions in these currencies, spot and forward. Contracts in other currencies may be cov- ered through the London or New York foreign exchange markets, against sterling or U.S. dollars. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Reserve Bank under powers delegated to its Governor by the Minister of Finance. The Reserve Bank in turn has given discretionary au thor i ty to the trading banks in New Zealand to approve applications for certain remittances of funds overseas. The Bank also is in charge of the controls over foreign direct investment in New Zealand. Export and import licensing is the responsibility of the Customs Department and the De- partment of Trade and Indus try, respectively. Prescription of Currency New Zealand has ceased to be a Scheduled Territory in terms of the U.K. Exchange Control Act, 1947 but under current U.K. exchange control regulations continues to be regarded as a country of the Overseas Sterling Area. Pay- ments to and from residents of countries other than New Zealand may generally be made or received in any foreign currency. 1 Payment to and from the New Zealand currency accounts held with banks in New Zealand by banks not domiciled in New Zealand or Rhodesia generally also is an acceptable form of payment. Nonresident Accounts The Reserve Bank supervises certain specified accounts in New Zealand of residents of other countries ("controlled ac- counts"). The accounts in New Zealand dollars of overseas banks may be used for the settlement of transactions with other countries, but they may only be funded from overseas or by amounts which would otherwise be remittable from New Zealand. Imports and Import Payments Imports are controlled through an annual Import Licens- ing Schedule, which groups imports into different categories to which various import procedures are applied. On a value basis, about 75 per cent of all private imports are exempt from licensing. The import categories included in the Schedule for July 1, 1973-June 30, 1974, are as follows: Category "E" (exempt) includes petroleum, lubricating oils, certain other raw materials, green coffee, cocoa beans, jute, many textiles, and printed books which may be imported without license. In addition, certain imports of Australian origin are exempt from licensing, irrespective of the licensing category to which they belong. 2 A "Basic" category comprises items for which licenses are granted by reference to qualifying licenses issued or actual imports in a previous licensing period. Category "C" licenses are granted on an individual basis on such criteria as essentiality, availability, and price; for some "C" items, how- ever, an initial allocation based on a previous period is pro- vided, while applications for further licenses are considered individually. Category "D" includes items of a type also pro- duced in New Zealand, for which licenses are issued only in exceptional circumstances. In addition, licenses for small or "token" amounts are issued (to the extent of 110 per cent of 1972/73 licenses for the same goods on a value basis, and at 100 per cent where they are issued for a specific quantity of goods) for "D" items and for certain approved classes of goods, imports of which are generally not permitted under the Schedule. "Administrative basic licenses" are issued auto- matically to ensure continuity of importation for certain regu- larly required goods that correspond to only part of an item code. All licenses issued may be used for imports from any source at the applicant's discretion. Imports from Rhodesia, how- ever, are prohibited. A degree of flexibility in the application of the Licensing Schedule is achieved through the use of Group Schemes (for Industry and Interchangeability Groups) that enable importers to transfer individual entitle- ments to a composite license, instead of holding licenses for separate items, and to import, up to the total amount, any item or combination of items in the group. 1 Foreign currencies are defined as all currencies other than New Zealand currency. 2 Under the terms of the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement that came in to force on January 1, 1966. 320 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution "No-remittance licenses" for imports outside the Import Licensing Schedule may be issued in special circumstances, viz., for advertising material supplied free of charge; gifts, passengers' baggage, replacement of faulty or damaged goods; trade samples supplied free of charge; and temporary imports. The trading banks have authority to make foreign ex- change in an appropriate currency available for payments in respect of all licensed imports and all imports that do not require a license. Payments for Invisibles The trading banks are permitted to sell exchange for over- seas payments up to established limits for many categories of invisibles, subject in appropriate cases to the submission of justifying documents. Payments beyond the established limits, and for categories not included in the commercial banks' permitted list, require the specific approval of the Reserve Bank; applications must be supported, where appro- priate, by justifying documents. Banks are authorized to sell foreign exchange for genuine foreign travel purposes without prior reference to the Reserve Bank up to $NZ 1,000 a person a month or part thereof, with a maximum of $NZ 4,000 a person in any 12-month period. Requests for amounts in excess of $NZ 1,000 a month or for a total of more than $NZ 4,000 in any 12-month period must be referred to the Reserve Bank. Larger amounts of exchange for any type of travel are authorized at the discretion of the Reserve Bank, which meets all reasonable requests for genuine travel pur- poses. In addition to the above allocations, banks in New Zealand and their branches or agents in London and Austra- lia may sell foreign currencies, without limit as to amount, to New Zealand travelers against these persons' privately held foreign funds. The remittance abroad of dividends, interest, and profits due to nonresidents is approved, subject to formal authenti- cation; for dividends and interest, the approval authority has been delegated to the authorized banks. Most contractual obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business also are normally approved, but each remittance requires ap- proval and new commitments such as royalty agreements with overseas licensors or overseas borrowing require the prior consent of the Reserve Bank. Allocations for remittances on account of maintenance and /or gifts are made on a yearly basis without discrimina- tion. Remittances by recognized New Zealand religious and charitable organizations or individuals operating as members of such an organization are not subject to any limitation. Allocations to individuals for religious and charitable remit- tances, other than of the type specified above, are approved by the Reserve Bank up to $NZ 100 a remitter, and applica- tions for larger amounts are considered on their merits. Any resident may freely make personal remittances up to $NZ 20 a year to any destination overseas except Rhodesia. Travelers may take with them up to $NZ 50 in New Zealand currency, regardless of destination. Banknotes taken out may not be in denominations larger than $NZ 5. Up to $NZ 4 of the permitted total may be in coins. NEW ZEALAND Exports and Export Proceeds With minor exceptions, all exports require export licenses. These are issued by the Customs Department and carry the condition that the net export proceeds must be surrendered to a trading bank in accordance with the prescription of currency regulations. General export licenses valid until De- cember 31, 1974 are issued to regular exporters. Payments for exports must, unless prior consent is obtained, be received within six months from the date of shipment. Exports to Rhodesia are prohibited. Certain items classified as strategic goods may only be exported when particular requirements have been met and subsequent to the issue of a permit to export. Temporary restrictions have been imposed on exports of tallow and specified types of mutton. Exports of beef and veal to the United States and cheddar-type cheese to the United Kingdom are subject to restraint. Under an export bonus scheme, manufacturers submitting evidence of exportation may receive a replacement import license of the same value as the imported raw material or components still subject to import control that are incorpo- rated in the exported goods, as well as, subject to certain conditions being met, an additional bonus license; goods im- ported against the bonus license may be used for the manufac- ture of goods for the home market or for export. The bonus license must not exceed the difference between the f.o.b. value of the goods exported and the c.i.f. value of imported materi- als and /or components used in manufacture by the exporter. Proceeds from Invisibles When remuneration for services provided or to be provided in New Zealand for overseas residents by New Zealand resi- dents (including corporate bodies ordinarily resident in New Zealand) is paid in the form of foreign assets, 3 their foreign currency proceeds must be sold to the New Zealand banking system; interest and dividends earned overseas from portfolio investment are excluded from this surrender requirement. If the remuneration is in a form other than foreign currency or a balance with an overseas bank, it must be converted into foreign currency before the surrender takes place. The disposal overseas by New Zealand residents of foreign income from other invisibles such as interest and dividends is permitted, but such income is not eligible for sale in ex- change for New Zealand currency, except that the foreign currency proceeds may be sold to a New Zealand bank. Travelers may bring into the country unlimited amounts of foreign and domestic banknotes and coins, provided that any New Zealand banknotes brought in are in denominations not exceeding $NZ 5. 3 The kinds of remuneration that are involved are (1) the payment or provision of any money; (2) the crediting of any sum in any account at any bank or with any person; (3) the acquisition or provision of any securities, or any real or personal property, or of any right thereto or interest therein (whether actual or contingent); and (4) any benefit, whether by way of doing work or the performance of services, or otherwise, under any contract agreement, scheme, or transaction of any kind (whether or not it is enforceable or intended to be enforceable by legal proceedings). 321 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NEW ZEALAND Capital With the exception of certain capital issues outside New Zealand and certain overseas borrowings by corporate bo- dies, there is no restriction on capital receipts; applications to borrow abroad by companies operating in the finance and property sectors are not normally approved. To be eligible for repatriation, capital must have been initially transferred to New Zealand through normal banking channels or in some other way approved by the authorities, e.g., as imports of plant or machinery. Capital so transferred, including capital gains and capitalized profits, may be repatriated, after the formal approval of the Reserve Bank has been obtained. Overseas companies seeking to commence business in New Zealand require the approval of the Reserve Bank. Capital issues outside New Zealand by companies incorpo- rated in New Zealand require the approval of the Reserve Bank; overseas borrowing by such companies also requires prior approval. In order to encourage desirable types of in- flow of private foreign capital, forward exchange cover is provided for borrowings abroad by New Zealand companies and by foreign-owned companies that have received consent under the Capital Issues Regulations to borrow in New Zealand. Foreign borrowings under this scheme must be for a specific project which directly assists the development of New Zealand industry. Forward exchange cover is for the amount of the capital sum only and is normally limited to not less than $NZ 50,000 and not more than $NZ 1 million for each project. New Zealand subsidiaries and branches of overseas compa- nies must obtain the consent of the Reserve Bank if they wish to borrow in New Zealand, whether for long-term or short-term finance; the ratio between New Zealand and over- seas borrowing that is permitted is generally related to that between New Zealand and overseas equity holdings. 4 Non- resident persons or companies desiring to make a direct in- vestment in a New Zealand company through the purchase or exchange of shares are required to give notice of any offer made for such shares whenever the investment would result in the control by the offerer of 25 per cent or more of the New Zealand company's voting capital. Within two weeks of regis- tration the Minister of Finance must notify the offerer as to whether or not the offer is to be considered further. If further consideration is to be given, the Minister of Finance must give a final decision within six weeks of the date of registration. Emigrants to any destination other than Rhodesia may upon designation as nonresidents transfer the whole of their assets to their new country of residence. Applications for the remittance abroad of legacies from the estate of a New Zealand resident are normally approved in full. The authorities do not normally make exchange available to private persons or firms for the purchase of overseas securi- ties for portfolio investment. New Zealand Government bonds purchased overseas by New Zealand residents after September 5, 1969 may not be transferred from the United Kingdom to the New Zealand register. A New Zealand resi- 4 On March 15, 1974 the Reserve Bank reduced permitted local borrowing by wholly or partly overseas-owned nonfinance companies; the ceiling on borrowing for working capital purposes was set at the pre-June 1973 level, i.e., 10 per cent of annual turnover. 322 dent owning overseas securities is free to sell them to overseas residents for any foreign currency, which may be reinvested in other overseas securities, surrendered, or retained at the disposal of the New Zealand resident. With limited excep- tions, sales of overseas securities by one New Zealand resi- dent to another may be made only in exchange for other overseas securities or for any overseas currency. The only overseas securities that may be traded between New Zealand residents in exchange for New Zealand currency are those of any overseas country which were registered in the names of New Zealand residents on June 16, 1966 and for which scrip or other documents evidencing title were issued; the pur- chaser must lodge the share scrip with an approved deposi- tory (i.e., the Reserve Bank of New Zealand). These securities may also be sold for any overseas currency, in which case the proceeds must immediately be remitted to New Zealand through the banking system or reinvested in other overseas securities within three months and the resulting scrip depos- ited. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in New Zealand for numismatic purposes. Since the revocation in 1954 of the Gold Acquisition Notice, 1948, it is no longer necessary to offer gold to the Reserve Bank, and sales within New Zealand do not require Reserve Bank approval. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry constituting the per- sonal effects of a traveler require licenses issued by the Cus- toms Department; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the mone- tary authorities and industrial users. Commercial imports of gold jewelry are licensed restrictively. Changes during 1973 January 15. In a policy statement, the Minister of Finance set out the general approach of the Government to invest- ment in New Zealand by nonresidents, as well as the detailed criteria which would be applied to each proposal on a case-by-case basis. The degree and significance of participa- tion by New Zealand shareholders would be taken into ac- count. Overseas interests wishing to acquire control of an existing New Zealand firm would be required to demonstrate that their proposal would bring substantial new benefits to the New Zealand economy which would not be provided by continued local ownership. No approval would be granted where the interest of the applicant was merely to gain profits from property speculation or other forms of speculation, and where a proposal involved overseas ownership of land, deci- sions would be consistent with the Government's general land ownership policies. January 23. An order was gazetted which provided for the addition, in three stages, of a large number of automobile parts to those that assemblers had to obtain from local manu- facturers. February 1. The trade agreements with the United King- dom of 1959 and 1966 expired, as did the remaining provi- sions of the Ottawa Agreement of 1932 with that country. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution February 14. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, New Zealand maintained the par value of its currency in terms of gold. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously $NZ 1 = US$1.21600, became $NZ 1 = US$1.35111. February 15. The Reserve Bank quoted new telegraphic transfer buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar of US$1.3337 and US$1.3207 per $NZ 1, respectively. March 2. Exchange transactions were suspended. Trading banks were permitted to resume dealing in Australian dollars and U.S. dollars on March 6. March 8. The export of all grains was prohibited. March 9. The diversification scheme for exports of lamb was suspended for the remainder of the export season. March 13. The Reserve Bank permitted trading banks to resume dealing in sterling, spot and forward. They continued to be permitted to quote firm rates for U.S. dollars and Aus- tralian dollars; this permission was extended to other curren- cies on March 20. March 17. The Government introduced the Overseas In- vestment Bill, which would establish a separate Overseas In- vestment Commission to deal with proposals for foreign investment in New Zealand. The Act was to be administered by the Reserve Bank. The Act came into force on July 30. April 2. The responsibility for the administration of import licensing was transferred from the Customs Department to the Department of Trade and Industry. April 4. The 1973/74 Import Licensing Schedule was an- nounced, to become effective on July 1. Allocations (basic licenses) would generally be at 110 per cent of the 1972/73 level. Reduced allocations were set for specified textiles and a few other items. Token licenses issued on a value basis would be 110 per cent of 1972/73 licenses and those on a quantity basis would be 100 per cent of 1972/73 licenses. The "new importers" scheme was suspended. May 11. New Zealand ceased to invoke Article XII of the GATT. May 29. New Zealand acceded to the OECD Convention and to the OECD Codes of Liberalization of Current Invisi- ble Operations and of Capital Movements. June 1. A reserve assets ratio system of control over trading bank operations in New Zealand replaced the lending ceiling and guideline systems of control. The minimum liquidity re- quirement was expressed in terms of demand and time de- posit liabilities, without distinction between liabilities to residents and nonresidents. June 9. The fixed relationship between the New Zealand dollar and the U.S. dollar was discontinued; exchange rates would, until further notice, be determined daily, and the exist- ing margins around parity could be exceeded. The Reserve Bank approved, for quotation to the public by the trading banks, opening telegraphic transfer rates for the U.S. dollar of US$1.3768 buying, and US$1.3638 selling, per New Zealand dollar. June 14. It was announced that the export incentive scheme was to be narrowed to cover only processed products. The export market development incentive scheme was extended until March 31, 1977. An Export-Import Corporation would be set up. NEW ZEALAND June 14. The import license allocation for 1973/74 was increased from 110 per cent to 115 per cent of the 1972/73 issue, subject to some exceptions. In addition, licenses for a fu r ther 4,500 built-up cars were to be issued, doubling the allocation provided for in the original 1973/74 issue; the value of these additional licenses would be about $NZ 9 million. Further special licenses would be issued for goods for which a domestic shortage arose. June 15. The Reserve Bank provided details of the relax- ation of restrictions on borrowing in New Zealand by wholly or partly overseas-owned companies operating in New Zealand that had been announced in the budget statement. Under existing regulations, all wholly or partly over- seas-owned companies (25 per cent or more) had been permit- ted to raise a proportion of their working capital requirements in New Zealand. The permitted amount varied according to the nature of the business, but as a general rule a maximum of 10 per cent of annual turnover had applied. In fu tu re the Reserve Bank would take a slightly more liberal attitude on borrowing for this purpose. The rules which broadly related the amount of further funds which companies could raise to the proportion of their equity capital held by New Zealand residents had also been relaxed. Companies which were predominantly owned and also controlled by New Zealand residents (where more than 50 per cent of the voting shares were in New Zealand hands) would normally be permitted to borrow all of their require- ments in New Zealand. Companies with some New Zealand equity, but less than a majority interest, would be permitted to raise additional funds in New Zealand provided they had raised or were about to raise loan funds overseas. In future, a company which was 50 per cent New Zealand-owned would be permitted to raise funds in New Zealand, in addition to the working capital entitlement, equal to three times of the amount borrowed overseas, and a 25 per cent New Zea- land-owned company an amount equal to 60 per cent of the total overseas loans. Companies which were 100 per cent foreign owned would not be given additional access to New Zealand loan funds other than the slightly more liberal alloca- tion to assist them with their working capital requirements. The Capital Issues (Overseas) Regulations, 1965 would not be amended. It remained necessary for all companies which had 25 per cent or more of their voting shares held by "over- seas persons" to apply to the Reserve Bank for the necessary consent to borrow in New Zealand. The Reserve Bank would also treat in terms of the Government's new policy applica- tions submitted through the trading banks for increases in overdraft limits. June 15. The Reserve Bank announced that the Govern- ment had decided to discourage inflows of capital in the form of loan funds. Previously, the Bank had been agreeing freely to all applications to borrow overseas by companies operat- ing in New Zealand, provided the terms were reasonable and the maturity exceeded 12 months. In future, applications by companies operating in the finance and property sectors would be approved in exceptional circumstances only, whether they were New Zealand or foreign owned. Arrange- ments would be made to give foreign-owned firms already 323 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NEW ZEALAND operating in these sectors greater access to New Zealand loan funds. June 20. The trading banks* authority to sell foreign ex- change for overseas travel was increased from $NZ 600 to $NZ 1,000 a person a month, and the maximum they were authorized to make available to any one person in any 12-month period was raised from $NZ 1,800 to $NZ 4,000. June 27. It was announced that additional import licenses for building supplies were being issued. July 1. The preferential tariff margins for goods of U.K. origin listed in Part II of the New Zealand customs tariff were eliminated. This action began the phasing out of tariff prefer- ences for goods of U.K. origin, which was to be completed by June 30, 1977. September 9. Temporary export restrictions were imposed on fish, meat meal, tallow, and specified types of mutton. September 9. It was announced that during 1973/74 addi- tional import licenses amounting to $NZ 70 million would be issued. In addition, traditional importers of built-up cars would receive a 50 per cent increase in their basic allocations and car assemblers could apply for extra licenses to import built-up automobiles. September JO. The New Zealand dollar was revalued by 10 per cent as a result of a decision to move the market rate for the New Zealand dollar up by 10 per cent. The Reserve Bank would continue to adjust the exchange rate daily so as to maintain the new relationship with the currencies of New Zealand's major trading partners. The Reserve Bank ap- proved the following telegraphic transfer rates for quotation to the public on September 10 by trading banks: US$1.4845 buying, and US$1.4715 selling, per New Zealand dollar. October 3. Further restrictions were imposed on exports of fish. They were removed on December 15. November 6. The diversification target for sales of lamb to countries other than the United Kingdom was increased from 22 per cent to 23 per cent. 324 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NICARAGUA Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.105237 gram of fine gold per Nicaraguan Cordoba, corresponding to C$8.44447 = SDR 1 or C$7.00 = US$1. The Central Bank of Nicaragua deals with the commercial banks in U.S. dollars, the intervention currency, at C$7.00 per US$1, buying and selling, and sells exchange to the Government at C$7.0525 per US$1. All exchange transactions between commercial banks and the public take place at the official rates of C$7.00 buying, and C$7.0525 selling, per US$1. The sale of foreign exchange by commercial banks to the public is subject to a stamp tax of V2 of 1 per cent, which results in an effective selling rate of C$7.0875 per US$1. No tax or commission is charged on the buying rate. Nicaragua accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sec- tions 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from July 20, 1964. Administration of Control The control system is administered by the Central Bank, which by law has the sole authority to buy and sell foreign exchange. This authority has been delegated to the commer- cial banks, and the Central Bank deals with the public only to the extent that it accepts deposits in foreign currency, and for purposes of monetary control. Certain agencies are also authorized to buy and sell foreign exchange, but they may sell exchange only for payments for invisibles. The Central Bank is responsible for classifying imports and determining any advance deposits required; no advance deposit requirements are in force at present. Prescription of Currency There is no prescription of currency, but the customs au- thorities have the power to prohibit an export if the currency stipulated for payment is not readily convertible into U.S. dollars in international markets. Payments to Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras in respect of trade and invisibles may be settled in Nicaraguan cordobas through the Camara de Compensation Centroamericana, a clearinghouse established by the central banks of Central America to foster the process of economic integration of their countries. Pay- ments to Mexico may also be settled in Nicaraguan cordobas through the clearinghouse. The Central Bank does not accept banknotes of Costa Rica or El Salvador for compensation through the clearinghouse in excess of the following amounts a month: 66,250 Costa Rican colones and 400,000 Salva- doran colones. Imports and Import Payments All importers are required to be registered. There are two categories of registered importers: those who are permitted to import any kind of merchandise and those who may import only for their own industrial needs. Imports from all countries, except the other Central American countries, must be consigned to persons or firms holding a commercial license from the Ministry of Economy. Import licenses are not re- quired, but import transactions must be registered with the Central Bank by means of import declarations. All imports on credit and all prepayments for imports require approval by the Central Bank, which is normally granted only for capital goods, industrial materials, and other essential goods; when payment is not being made on sight of documents, an application for registration of the order must be submitted to the Central Bank. Imports of certain types of footwear and some pharmaceutical and veterinary supplies are prohibited, except when produced in countries signatory to the General Treaty for Central American Economic Integration. Payments for imports must be made with exchange pur- chased from banks.1 Payments are usually made by sight drafts. Letters of credit are mostly confined to imports from Japan. Central Bank approval is not required to open an import letter of credit. The banks are not permitted to sell exchange for import payments in advance of the arrival of the documents. The Central Bank may authorize deferred pay- ment or payment with funds derived from properly authenti- cated credits obtained abroad, provided that the imports are capital goods intended for development or production or for basic works complementary to production; such permission is at present limited mainly to industrial and agricultural machinery and, for certain industries, raw materials. Imports are not released from customs unless evidence is submitted either that payment has been made through a bank (con- stancia depago) or that acceptance has been made through a bank (constancia de aceptaciori). In the latter case, the Central Bank must also approve the importation on credit terms; this requirement does not apply to duty-free imports from mem- ber countries of the Central American Common Market. Most imports originating outside the Central American Common Market are subject to an import surcharge of 30 per cent of the applicable import duty. Certain commodities are subject to a compensatory consumption tax irrespective of their origin. Furthermore, most commodities are subject to a 5 per cent general sales tax, whether they are imported or domestically produced. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles are not subject to license and may be made freely. Persons purchasing foreign currency to make payments for invisibles are required, for statistical purposes, to complete a declaration specifying the purpose for which the foreign currency obtained will be used. Domestic and foreign currency notes may be exported freely. Exports and Export Proceeds Export licenses are not required, but a declaration to the customs authorities must be completed for statistical pur- poses. The exchange proceeds of exports do not have to be 1 However, by virtue of Decree No.l-L (effective March 1, 1963) the exchange proceeds from bananas, coconuts, copra, and coconut by-products exported through the ports of the region of El Cabo and the department of Zelaya may be used by the exporters to pay for commodities not produced in Nicaragua which they themselves import for the exclusive use of or consump- tion by the inhabitants of those areas. 325 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NICARAGUA surrendered; however, they may not be used to pay for im- ports (exchange for which must be purchased from a bank, with the exception noted in footnote 1). For certain agricul- tural exports (live cattle, beans, rice, com, and cottonseed), the Ministry of Economy can fix minimum export prices or temporarily prohibit their export in order to avoid domestic shortages. Exports of 17 commodities to countries outside the Central American Common Market are subject to a tax of 10 per cent of the f.o.b. value or of the reference value (aford). Proceeds from Invisibles The surrender of foreign exchange derived from invisibles is not required. Domestic and foreign currency notes may be imported freely. Capital Remittances on account of foreign capital and capital transfers by residents and nonresidents may be made freely under the general provisions of the Exchange Law of March 1, 1963 or under the Law on Foreign Investments of February 26,1955 (effective March 11,1955). Under the 1955 law, foreign investments approved by the Central Bank and registered are guaranteed the following privileges: repatria- tion of the registered capital; transfer of earnings, profits, or interest on the capital; and re-exportation of goods imported for investment. Commercial banks and private investment companies require the prior approval of the Central Bank for all borrowing abroad. Gold Residents may freely and without license purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form in Nicaragua. Producers of gold sell their newly mined gold at free market prices to buyers abroad. The Central Bank purchases gold abroad for resale to domestic industrial and other users. Nonmonetary imports and exports of gold do not require import or export licenses but must be registered with the Central Bank and require prior government authorization. Commemorative gold coins were issued in 1967. Changes during 1973 During the year, various essential commodities were added to the list of those that may be imported on credit terms. Certain nonluxury goods, required to rebuild inventories, were also added. All these additions were revoked for 1974. January 6. An ad valorem levy of 10 per cent of the f.o.b. value was imposed on the principal exports. The levy was not applicable to exports to countries of the Central American Common Market. Subsequently, reference prices were estab- lished for some of these commodities. January 16. The amount of Salvadoran banknotes accepted for compensation through the Central American clearing- house was increased from 200,000 Salvadoran colones to 400,000 Salvadoran colones a month. On February 1, the limit on Guatemalan banknotes (Q 125,000 a month) was removed. February 13. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the exchange rate of C$7.00 = US$1 was maintained unchanged. October 18. The par value of the cordoba was changed from 0.116930 gram to 0.105237 gram of fine gold per cordoba, corresponding to C$8.44447 = SDR 1. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar remained unchanged at C$7.00 = US$1. 326 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NIGER Exchange System No par value for the currency of Niger has been established with the Fund. The unit of currency is the CFA Franc 1 which is officially maintained at the rate of CFAF 1 = 0.02 French franc. Exchange transactions in French francs, the interven- tion currency, between the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de POuest (BCEAO) and commercial banks take place at the rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02, free of commission. Exchange transactions relating to foreign countries, i.e., countries other than France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories except the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries of the French Franc Area, take place in a dual exchange market at rates based on the fixed rate for the French franc and the Paris exchange rate for the foreign currency concerned in either the official exchange market or the financial franc mar- ket. Settlements eligible for the official exchange market are payments and receipts in respect of imports, exports, and most other current transactions, as well as all current pay- ments by or in favor of domestic and foreign public authori- ties and public bodies. All other settlements with foreign countries, as well as transactions in banknotes of foreign countries and banknotes issued by the BCEAO, take place through the financial franc market at freely fluctuating rates. The principal current payments and receipts channeled through the financial franc market are those relating to travel expenses, capital earnings, and workers' remittances. Ex- change rates for certain European currencies in the official market are based on par values and central rates; the effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar in this market is not confined within any announced margins. With the exception of those relating to gold, Niger's ex- change control measures do not apply to (1) France (as de- fined above) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Opera- tions Account (Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the People's Republic of the Congo, Dahomey, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mali, Senegal, Togo, and Upper Volta). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries, except Niger itself, are considered foreign countries, and in principle financial relations only with for- eign countries are subject to exchange control. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the External Finance Division in the Ministry of Finance and Sahara and Nomad Affairs which also supervises borrowing abroad, the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Niger, and inward and outward investment. The BCEAO is autho- rized to collect, either direct or through the intermediary of banks, financial institutions, the Postal Administration, and notaries public, any information necessary to compile the balance of payments statistics. All exchange transactions re- 1 The CFA franc is issued by the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de POuest (BCEAO) and is the common currency in Dahomey, Ivory Coast, Niger, Senegal, Togo, and Upper Volta. lating to foreign countries must be effected through the BCEAO or authorized banks. Import and export licenses are issued by the Directorate of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Commerce, and Industry, subject to the visa of the External Finance Division, except those for gold, which are granted by the Ministry of Finance and Sahara and Nomad Affairs. Import certificates for liberalized commodi- ties are made out by the importer himself and, when imports are payable prior to importation, are first approved by the External Finance Division. Prescription of Currency Niger is an Operations Account country of the French Franc Area, since the BCEAO maintains an Operations Ac- count with the French Treasury; settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the other Operations Account countries of the French Franc Area are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other Operations Ac- count country. Settlements with all other countries are usu- ally made through correspondent banks in France in foreign currencies or in French francs through Foreign or Financial Accounts in Francs. Certain settlements with Nigeria, how- ever, are made through special accounts. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. BCEAO banknotes may be credited to Financial Accounts in Francs when they have been mailed direct to the BCEAO agency in Niamey by au- thorized banks' foreign correspondents. Otherwise, the cred- iting to nonresident accounts of BCEAO banknotes, French banknotes, or banknotes issued by any other institute of issue that maintains an Operations Account with the French Trea- sury is prohibited. Imports and Import Payments All imports of commodities originating in Portugal or its overseas provinces, Rhodesia, or South Africa are prohibited. The import from any source of rice, paddy, hulled rice, wheat flour, butane gas, many types of fabrics, and certain footwear and plastic goods requires prior authorization, irrespective of whether an import license or import certificate is also re- quired. A similar regime applies to imports of sugar, except from member countries of the Common Organization of Afri- can, Malagasy and Mauritian States, and to imports of matches, except from countries of the West African Customs Union. Imports from France and the Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area of all goods other than those mentioned may be made freely without a license or certificate. Imports from other countries require either a li- cense or an import certificate. Imports of virtually all goods from Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and EEC countries, many goods, from other former OEEC countries and their past or present dependent territories, and a smaller number of items from the United States and Canada are liberalized and require 327 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NIGER only an import certificate. Imports of nonliberalized goods from non-EEC countries outside the French Franc Area are made under global quotas in accordance with an annual pro- gram that is determined each year by the Ministry of Eco- nomic Affairs, Commerce, and Industry; the program generally reflects the requirements indicated by importers and is established in mutual agreement within a joint French-Nigerien Committee. Licenses for printed or im- printed cotton fabrics and for jute bags, however, are issued in proportion to duly substantiated imports from France of a specified quan t i ty of these goods. Goods not subject to quantitative restriction may be imported on an import certifi- cate, i.e., a declaration made out by the importer. The Societe Nationale de Commerce et de Production du Niger (COPRONIGER) has a monopoly over the import of specified commodities. These include wheat, wheat flour, green tea, and certain textiles. All import transactions with foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank when valued at more than CFAF 25,000 c.i.f. Niger border. The import licenses or import certificates entitle importers to purchase the necessary exchange, provided that the autho- rized bank is satisfied that the import transaction is genuine and in accordance with the import title. Import certificates require the visa of the External Finance Division if the goods are payable before importation. Payments for In visibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Mo- naco, and the other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to the approval of the External Finance Division. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permit- ted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accru- ing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted freely when the basic transaction has been approved. Residents traveling on tourist trips to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the other Operations Account countries of the French Franc Area may obtain an exchange allocation of an amount equiva- lent to CFAF 100,000 a person a trip (CFAF 50,000 for children under ten), which may be taken up twice a year; any foreign exchange in excess of CFAF 5,000 remaining after return to Niger must be surrendered by sale to an authorized bank. The transfer of the full salary of a foreigner working in Niger is permitted upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher, provided that the transfer takes place within three months of the pay period. Resident travelers going to foreign countries may take out up to a maximum of CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO banknotes, French banknotes, and banknotes issued by other Operations Account countries, in addition to their travel allocation. Resi- dent travelers to other countries of the French Franc Area may take out any amount in BCEAO banknotes but, when traveling to a French Franc Area country outside the West African Monetary Union, must declare these if they exceed CFAF 150,000. Nonresident travelers may freely take out up to CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO banknotes, French banknotes, 328 and banknotes issued by other Operations Account countries, and foreign notes up to the amount declared upon en t ry ,2 or, if no declaration was made, up to CFAF 25,000; they may also take out freely any amount of travelers checks, etc., issued abroad in their name. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Rhodesia are prohibited. All exports of rice and paddy require the prior authorization of the Directorate of Economic Affairs. Exports of millet and sorghum are pro- hibited unless covered by a shipping document in the name of the OPVN. Gum arabic may be exported only by CO- PRONIGER. With the exception of peanuts, peanut oil, peanut cakes, sisal, cotton, cottonseed, and certain imported com- modities, all of which require a license, all other exports to France (as defined above) and the Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area may be made freely. Exports to all other countries of domestic products and im- ported commodities require a license and an exchange com- mitment. Export proceeds received in currencies other than those of France or another Operations Account country must be collected and surrendered within two months of the date on which payment falls due; this date must not, in principle, be later than 180 days after arrival of the goods at their destination. All export transactions with foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their total value exceeds CFAF 100,000. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services, and all income earned in those countries from for- eign assets, must be collected and surrendered within two months of the due date or the date of receipt. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of banknotes and coins issued by the BCEAO, the Bank of France, or a bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign banknotes and coins (except gold coins). Residents must surrender within eight days of entry any foreign currency in excess of CFAF 5,000. Capital Capital movements between Niger and France (as defined above), Monaco, and other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require exchange control ap- proval and are restricted, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted freely. Special controls (additional to any exchange control re- quirements that may be applicable) are maintained over bor- 2 This amount is reduced, when appropriate, by the amount sold for CFA francs and increased by the amount of foreign notes acquired in Niger by debit to a Financial Account in Francs or a foreign currency account, by exchange for other foreign means of payment brought in, or by repurchase with CFA francs (such repurchase being limited to the equivalent of CFAF 25,000). ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution rowing abroad, over inward and outward investment, and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Niger; these controls relate to the transactions themselves, not to payments or receipts. With the exception of those over foreign securities in Niger, these control mea- sures do not apply to relations with France (as defined above), Monaco, the other member countries of the West African Monetary Union, and those other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Opera- tions Account. Special controls are maintained also over the soliciting of funds for deposit with foreign private persons and foreign firms and institutions, and over all publicity aimed at placing funds abroad or at subscribing to real estate building operations abroad; these special controls do apply also to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Opera- tions Account countries. All investments abroad by residents of Niger require prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. 3 Foreign direct investments in Niger 4 must be declared to the Minister of Finance before they are made. The Minister has a period of two months from receipt of the declaration during which he may request the postponement of the projects submitted to him. The full or partial liquidation of investments, whether direct or not, also requires prior declaration. Both the making and the liquidation of investments, whether these are Nigerien investments abroad or foreign investments in Niger, must be reported to the Minister of Finance and the BCEAO within 20 days following each operation. Direct investments are defined as investments implying control of a company or enterprise. Mere participation is not considered as direct in- vestment, provided that it does not exceed 20 per cent in the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign secu- rities in Niger requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. Exempt from authorization, however, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Nigerien Government, and (2) shares that are similar to or may be substituted for securities whose issuing or offering for sale in Niger has previously been authorized. Borrowing by residents from nonresidents requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans constitut- ing a direct investment, which are subject to prior declara- tion, as indicated above; (2) loans contracted by authorized banks; and (3) loans other than those mentioned above, when the total amount outstanding of these loans, including the new borrowing, does not exceed CFAF 2 million for any one borrower, provided that the annual interest rate does not exceed the "normal" market rate and that the proceeds of the loan are immediately sold on the exchange market or debited to a Foreign Account in Francs. The repayment of any for- eign borrowing, whether authorized or exempt from authori- zation, requires the prior authorization of the Minister; 3 Including those made through the intermediary of foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in Niger and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Niger. 4 Including those made by companies in Niger that are directly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in Niger of foreign companies. NIGER exempt from this requirement are loans constituting a direct investment, loans taken up by authorized banks, and any loans exempted by the Minister. Lending abroad is subject to prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. Foreign investments in Niger may be granted certain guar- antees and facilities under the Investment Code of July 31, 1968 (Law No. 68-24/PRN), as amended by Law No. 71-2 of January 29, 1971. Existing benefits accorded under the previous Investment Code (Law No. 61-21 of July 12, 1961) have been maintained. The new Investment Code provides for privileged or regu- lar treatment. The latter provides, for both new and existing enterprises, assurances, with respect to indemnities in the event of nationalization, and concerning nondiscrimination between Nigerien nationals and foreign nationals; tax exemp- tions will be granted to new investments. Privileged treatment is reserved for enterprises deemed to be of special importance to national economic development and falling within speci- fied categories of industrial activities. Such treatment may be accorded under two different regimes, the approval regime and the agreement regime. Gold Residents are free to hold gold in any form in Niger. They are also free to acquire and dispose of gold in any form in Niger. Imports and exports of gold from or to any other country require prior authorization by the Minister of Fi- nance, which is seldom granted. Exempt from this require- ment are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the Treasury or the BCEAO; (2) imports and exports of manufac- tured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles); and (3) articles of gold up to a combined weight of 500 grams when carried by a traveler. Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Changes during 1973 January 26.

The commissions levied by the BCEAO on transfers to France and other countries of the French Franc Area (except those of the West African Monetary Union) were made identical with those on transfers to countries out- side the French Franc Area. The unified commission was increased on July 2. February 13. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the exchange rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02 was maintained; the effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously CFAF 255.785 = US$1, became CFAF 230.207 = US$1. March 19. With the entry into effect of new margins ar- rangements between the French franc and certain other Euro- pean currencies, and the maintenance of the exchange rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02, the CFA franc began to appreciate in terms of the U.S. dollar. 329 ©International Monetary Fund.

The par value is 2.48828 grams of fine gold per Nigerian pound, but a central rate has been established of 1.11973 grams of fine gold per naira, corresponding to N 0.793648 = SDR 1 or H 0.657893 = US$1. Nigeria avails itself of wider margins. The interven- tion currency is the U.S. dollar. The Central Bank of Nigeria twice weekly quotes rates at which it is prepared to deal in U.S. dollars and sterling with authorized dealers and the public; such dealings are for approved transactions and are on a spot basis only. The Central Bank's rates for the U.S. dollar are set at NIGERIA Imports and Import Payments Importers must be registered if they wish to obtain individ- ual import licenses. All imports from Namibia (South West Africa), Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited, as is the import from all countries of certain specified commodities for health, safety, moral, or religious reasons; the import of cer- tain other commodities is also prohibited unless specific con- ditions have been complied with and these conditions are specified in the license authorizing such imports. Individual import licenses are required for certain goods from all sources, including rice, corn, and wheat, as well as products the export of which is subject to Marketing Board control (see section on Exports and Export Proceeds, below). Im- ports which are neither prohibited nor subject to specific licensing may be imported under open general license. A mandatory deferred payment period of 90 days after shipment has been established for most commodities; for these imports, payment may be made either 90 days after the date of the bill of lading or upon customs clearance, which- ever is later. 2 Certain official imports and other specified imports, however, may be settled at sight of shipping docu- ments. Capital equipment with a value in excess of N 100,000 must be imported on specified deferred payment terms. Au- thorized dealers may otherwise grant foreign exchange for authorized imports in accordance with these prescribed pay- ment terms, but not prior to customs clearance. Payment in advance of shipment requires the approval of the Central Bank and is not normally allowed. A "national reconstruction surcharge" of 5 per cent of the applicable import du ty is levied on virtually all imports. 3 Payments for Invisibles Most payments to Rhodesia are prohibited. Payments for invisibles to residents of other countries are subject to indi- vidual approval; for some categories of invisibles this is granted by authorized dealers, either up to specified limits or up to the amount of the bill or invoice. Applications for payments that cannot be approved by authorized dealers and are not among those (such as profits and dividends) 4 that require approval by the Ministry of Finance are forwarded to the Central Bank, which gives approval for some types of payment, provided that tax and other requirements have been satisfied. However, certain delays may occur in the granting of the exchange. All insurance other than that for which facilities do not exist in Nigeria must be taken out with a company in Nigeria and all insurance companies operating in the country must reinsure with the National Insurance Cor- poration. Sixty per cent of ship charter payments must be 2 The 90-day requirement was abolished on April 1, 1974. At the same time, the prescribed minimum payments terms for imports of capital goods were made less stringent. 3 This surcharge was abolished on April 1, 1974. 4 Investment income exceeding 25 per cent of the amount accrued to nonresidents in 1972, and all such income accrued or accruing to nonresidents after 1972 are not transferable. On April 1, 1974 it was announced that the arrears from 1972 would be cleared in the new financial year and that new profits and dividends would be considered for remittance as they were desired. It was also stated that remittances of technical fees, management fees, and royalties would be permitted where it could be shown that these related to the import of modern technology. 332 settled in local currency, except when government-sponsored shipping companies are involved. Residents are entitled to a basic tourist travel allowance of fci 200 a person a year for travel outside Africa (N 100 a year a child, subject to a limit of fct 600 for any one family unit). Foreign exchange for this purpose may be sold to residents by authorized dealers. In addition, travel agents and shipping and airline companies in Nigeria may sell transportation tick- ets for any destination, except Rhodesia, against payment in Nigerian currency. The cost of services rendered by travel agents in respect of hotel accommodation, meals en route, etc., must be covered from the basic travel allowance. There is a separate basic allowance for travel within Africa. This allowance is N 50 a person a year (half of that for a child) where the return ticket is valued at less than £ 50, or up to the value of the ticket (subject to a maximum of N 200 for an adult a year or & 100 for a child) where the return ticket is valued at N 50 or more; in either case, the maximum for each family unit is N 600 in any calendar year. There is a separate basic travel allowance of N 300 an adult a year for pilgrimages, which may not be combined with the tourist allocation. Applications for nontourist travel must be submit- ted to the Central Bank. Foreign nationals residing in Nigeria may purchase annually foreign currency up to 50 per cent of their gross taxable earnings in Nigeria for all personal remit- tances (including insurance, education, and medical expenses, but excluding the basic travel allowance), up to a maximum of N 9,000 a person in any financial year. Applications in excess of this limit are examined on their merits by the Cen- tral Bank. Residents are permitted to take out the equivalent of their basic travel allowance in foreign currency notes and travelers checks; nonresident visitors may take out any foreign cur- rency notes and travelers checks that were declared upon entry, minus the amount converted locally into Nigerian cur- rency. The export of Nigerian currency notes and coins is prohibited. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Rhodesia are prohibited. Most locally produced goods may be exported freely, under open general license, to any country except South Africa and Namibia (South West Africa), exports to which require individual licenses. Individ- ual export licenses are required for exports of cigarettes and tobacco, columbite, tin and by-products of tin, tantalite, un- refined gold, petroleum products, goods made wholly or partly of imported components, and products subject to con- trol by Marketing Boards (e.g., cocoa, cotton, cottonseed, benniseed, groundnuts, groundnut oil, palm oil, and palm kernels). The selling abroad of all export crops purchased by the Marketing Boards is the responsibility of the Nigerian Produce Marketing Company. The export of certain goods (African antiquities or works of art produced before 1918, objects that are being used or have been used in African ceremonies) is prohibited, except under prescribed condi- tions. The export of explosives, other than industrial explo- sives, and of certain foodstuffs is prohibited. Exports of ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution petroleum and petroleum products are subject to special ar- rangements. 5 Export proceeds must be surrendered, through a commer- cial bank, to the Central Bank within three months of ship- ment. Exports of petroleum and petroleum products, however, are exempt from the surrender requirements. For all exports, the exporter is required to submit an exchange con- trol declaration at the time of shipment. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in foreign currencies must be of- fered for sale to an authorized dealer, who is required to surrender them to the Central Bank. Persons entering Nigeria may freely bring in foreign banknotes. The import of Nigerian currency notes and coins is prohibited. Capital Except for the purpose of financing imports 6 or exports, permission from the Ministry of Finance is required for any individual, firm, company, or branch resident in Nigeria to borrow in any country outside Nigeria. Official agencies and state-controlled corporations require the prior approval of the Ministry of Finance for any foreign borrowing. The per- mission of the Ministry of Finance is also required for bor- rowing in Nigeria (1) by any nonresident individual or company, and (2) by any company registered in Nigeria (other than a bank) which is controlled directly or indirectly from outside Nigeria. However, to enable entities mentioned under (2) to meet temporary shortages of funds, licensed banks in Nigeria may grant loans or overdrafts for periods not exceeding 14 days, or may increase the amount of any advance or overdraft by the amount of loan interest or bank charges payable thereon. General permission is also given for any loan, bank overdraft, or other credit facility to be ar- ranged to finance Nigerian imports or exports of goods. Banks have been directed to allocate 40 per cent of their total loans and advances to Nigerians. Residents of Nigeria may not deal in foreign currency secu- rities nor may they buy from or sell to nonresidents of Nigeria any security payable in Nigerian pounds or naira without the permission of the Ministry of Finance. The capital proceeds of securities registered in Nigeria and owned by nonresidents may be collected and negotiated through authorized dealers, provided that the prior permission of the Ministry of Finance is obtained. Remittances of cash gifts to nonresidents normally are restricted to the equivalent of & 100 for each transferor a calendar year in favor of charitable organizations outside Nigeria. Exchange for the transfer of certain assets by emi- grants or repatriates is granted on final departure from the country, but the transfer of the proceeds of assets realized to comply with the Nigerian Enterprises Promotion Decree, 1972 is subject to special rules. 5 On January 16, 1974 exports of groundnuts were suspended. 6 However, the taking up of suppliers' credit abroad (as distinguished from the mandatory deferred payments for imports) is subject to approval by the Ministry of Finance. NIGERIA Nonresidents intending to make direct investments in Ni- geria are invited to apply to the Ministry of Finance for "approved status," the granting of which means that sympa- thetic consideration will be given to future requests to repatri- ate the capital. The granting of "approved status" is not applicable to the purchase of shares on the stock exchange in Nigeria unless this forms an integral part of the approved investment project. Furthermore, this status is not normally granted when internally generated funds from profits, divi- dends, rents, or locally raised loans or bank credit are in- vested in local enterprises. With minor exceptions, foreign-owned companies and commercial banks operating in Nigeria must be incorporated in Nigeria. The repatriation of foreign capital requires approval from the Ministry of Fi- nance. Gold With the express permission of the Commissioner for Fi- nance, residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Nigeria for numismatic purposes. Residents other than the monetary authorities, producers of gold, and authorized industrial users are not allowed without special permission to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry or coins, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require specific licenses issued by the Ministry of Finance; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authori- ties, producers of gold, and industrial users. Furthermore, the import of gold coins current in the United Kingdom requires a license from the Commissioner of Customs and Excise. Imports of gold coins and of gold and silver bullion are duty free when made by the Central Bank for monetary purposes; otherwise, such imports are subject to customs duty at 100 per cent ad valorem. Changes during 1973 January 1. A new currency unit, the naira, was introduced to replace the Nigerian pound at a ratio of 2 naira = 1 Nigerian pound. No appreciation or depreciation of the cur- rency was involved. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar became & 1 = US$1.52, based on the previous relationship of £N 1 = US$3.04. January 1. The Government acquired equity participation in the three foreign-owned commercial banks, raising total Nigerian participation in each to 40 per cent. January. The Nigerian Produce Marketing Company was taken over by the Federal Government. February 14. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Nigeria established a central rate of 1.11973 grams of fine gold per naira, corresponding to N 0.793648 = SDR 1.

Export duties on produce subject to control by Marketing Boards were abolished and were replaced by a produce tax with a maximum rate of 10 per cent ad valorem. April 1. It was announced that the Central Bank was taking steps to diversify its external reserves. April 2. The mandatory 180-day deferred payment require- ment, which had been applicable to most imports, was abol- ished. With the exception of certain official imports and other specified imports that could be settled at sight of shipping documents (to which cement and other building materials were now added), and imports of capital equipment with a value in excess of fct 100,000, imports became subject to a mandatory deferred payment period of 90 days from the date of shipment; import payments could be made either 90 days after the date of the bill of lading or after arrival of the goods in Nigeria (i.e., upon customs clearance), whichever was later. April 3. Guidelines were issued for the repatriation of for- eign-owned capital that was disinvested as a result of the promulgation of the Nigerian Enterprises Promotion Decree, 1972. Repatriation of capital would not be allowed where the assets, especially real property, were sold to non-Nigerians (in such cases the buyer should pay in foreign exchange from his non-Nigerian income) or where the sales proceeds were in- volved of real estate developed from capital generated locally (except, in the case of private property, on the final emigra- tion of the owner). In the case of sales arising from Schedule I of the Decree (sales of 21 categories of enterprises reserved wholly for Nigerians), or where the seller was emigrating from Nigeria, repatriation of capital would be permitted on the following conditions: up to & 10,000 on approval; for amounts over & 10,000 but under fci 150,000, in six-monthly installments of & 30,000 each; for amounts over & 150,000 the rate of repatriation would be negotiable in order to en- courage the reinvestment of a proportion of the capital sum; where the owner of an enterprise was leaving Nigeria perma- nently, requests for the repatriation of capital would be treated sympathetically, particularly when capital proceeds were required for the re-establishment of a business abroad. For Schedule II enterprises (35 categories of small to me- dium-scale enterprises which have been restricted to Nigerian ownership or, for the large enterprises in this category, where Nigerian participation is to be 40 per cent), the seller must reinvest at least 50 per cent of the sale proceeds in the expan- sion of the business and related activities; the balance could be repatriated according to the regulations applied to cases under Schedule I. Nigerian citizens, including naturalized aliens, would not be granted the above-mentioned facilities for external transactions of a capital nature except in the case of personal savings of a marginal nature for indigenous Nige- rians temporarily resident abroad. April 13. Decree No. 14 set up a Capital Issue Commission. It was to determine (1) the price at which the shares or debentures of foreign-owned companies in Nigeria were to be sold to the public, either through offer for sale or by direct issue; and (2) the timing and amount of any subsequent public issues of shares or debentures by the companies concerned. April 13. The Companies (Special Provisions) Decree, 1973 amended, with retroactive effect to 1968, the Companies De- cree, 1968, which required all foreign companies operating in Nigeria to incorporate locally. Certain companies could be exempted from local incorporation; they would then have the status of an unregistered company. June 11. An agreement was signed whereby Nigeria ac- quired a 35 per cent equity participation in a major foreign-owned petroleum company, with retroactive effect from April 1. July 5.

Margins of 2% per cent are maintained for spot rates in the official exchange market between the Norwegian krone and the Belgian franc, the Danish krone, the deutsche mark, the French franc, the Luxembourg franc, the Netherlands guilder, and the Swedish krona. No announced margins are maintained for other currencies. On December 31, 1973 the buying and selling rates of the authorized banks for the U.S. dollar were NKr 5.715 and NKr 5.74, respectively. Forward premiums and discounts are left to the interplay of market forces. Authorized banks' forward transactions with non- bank residents must have a commercial basis. Norway formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from May 11, 1967. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Ministry of Com- merce and Shipping in cooperation with the Bank of Norway. The authority to approve most current payments has been delegated to authorized banks. Import and export licenses, when required, are issued by the Ministry of Commerce and Shipping and, in certain cases, by the Ministry of Agriculture or the Ministry of Fisheries. Imports and exports of precious metals, and of semimanufactured articles thereof, are licensed by the Bank of Norway. Prescription of Currency Payments between Norway and Rhodesia are prohibited when they relate to imports, exports, or transit trade, and in all other cases are subject to special license issued by the Bank of Norway.

Nonresident Accounts The main type of nonresident account is the Convertible Krone Account. Such accounts may be held by residents of all countries. They may be credited with authorized payments to any country, with transfers from other Convertible Krone Accounts, and with proceeds from the sale in Norway of convertible currencies. They may be debited for authorized payments from any country to residents of Norway, for trans- fers to other Convertible Krone Accounts, and for purchases in Norway of any foreign currency. 1 In view of certain changes that took place on January 1, 1974 (see note at the end of this survey), this survey presents the position on that date. Most commodities do not require an import license. Indus- trial goods may be imported freely from the import free list area 2 upon presentation of the original invoice. Imports of certain agricultural products are restricted, irrespective of origin. There are two restricted lists for industrial goods for specified countries—one applicable to imports from Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Hungary, Poland, Roma- nia, and the U.S.S.R., and the other applicable to imports from Japan and the Republic of Korea; many of the goods on these lists are licensed automatically. Imports from Rho- desia are prohibited. A global quota list contains 9 quotas for agricultural prod- ucts for which imports are permitted up to fixed limits; these quotas apply to all countries. New and secondhand ships built abroad, other than ships that are 20 years old or older and certain categories of fishing vessels, may be imported freely, 3 but special permission is required in order to super- vise compliance with certain regulations regarding payments in advance of delivery. The import of a small number of commodities is prohibited for health and similar reasons, and certain goods (some grains, alcoholic beverages, equipment and materials for the fishing industry, pharmaceutical prod- ucts, and drugs) are imported by government monopolies. If no license is required or when an import license has been obtained, payment may be made without delay, provided that the method of payment is in conformity with the general rules (see section on Prescription of Currency, above). Payments for Invisibles Payments to any country except Rhodesia for all current invisibles, including income from capital and contractual am- ortization, may be made freely. Payments for any purpose to any country other than Rhodesia do not require verification by authorized banks, provided that these payments do not exceed the equivalent of NKr 500. The granting of exchange for travel purposes is not re- stricted. The basic exchange allowance for tourist travel abroad is equivalent to NKr 5,000 a trip for each person. For business travel, the banks may sell reasonable amounts. Each person leaving Norway may take with him up to NKr 800 in Norwegian banknotes, in denominations not exceeding NKr 100. Nonresidents leaving Norway may, in addition, export any foreign banknotes brought into the country by them. Exports and Export Proceeds Most goods may be exported freely to countries in the 2 All countries except Albania, Bulgaria, People's Republic of China, Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Hungary, Japan, North Korea, Republic of Korea, Macao, Mongolia, Poland, Rhodesia, Romania, U.S.S.R., and North Viet-Nam. 3 Automatic authorization is not granted for imports from Albania, Peo- ple's Republic of China, Republic of China, Eastern Germany, Macao, Mongolia, North Korea, North Viet-Nam, and Rhodesia. 335 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution NORWAY export free list area, 4 against a declaration or a license, which is granted automatically. Exports subject to regulation are listed and require export licenses. All exports to countries outside the export free list area require an export license. Exports valued at not more than NKr 500 to any country are exempt from export license. Exports to Rhodesia are prohib- ited, with the exception of shipments for medical, humanitar- ian, or educational purposes. Payments must be received within 12 months of shipment and in conformity with the regulations (see section on Pre- scription of Currency, above). In principle, all exchange from exports must be surrendered. (The surrender requirement, which had been suspended in August 1971, was restored on February 11, 1972.) Proceeds from Invisibles In principle, receipts from invisibles must be surrendered. Each person entering Norway may bring in any amount in Norwegian currency, in denominations not exceeding NKr 100, and in other means of payment. Capital Inward transfers of capital and investments in Norway by nonresidents must be approved by the Bank of Norway. Out- ward transfers of capital require individual licenses; the granting of these licenses depends on the merits of the case. Licenses for outward transfers of proceeds from the sale or liquidation of investments made in Norway by nonresidents are granted freely, and nonresident capital may be repatriated automatically. Payments for contractual amortization are also permitted freely. Most transactions in securities involv- ing nonresident interests are subject to approval. Norwegian securities denominated in Norwegian kroner and purchased by nonresidents from Norwegian residents by special permis- sion may be resold to Norwegian residents who will be granted licenses for the transfer of the proceeds from the sale; the purchase of shares of Norwegian banking and industrial firms by nonresidents is licensed restrictively on a case- by-case basis. Personal capital transfers, such as transfers relating to fam- ily loans, gifts, inheritances, legacies, dowries, emigrants' as- sets, savings of nonresident workers, and amounts in settlement of immigrants' debts, may be made freely. In general, resident-owned capital assets abroad, other than securities, real estate, and other authorized investments, have to be surrendered. Applications for capital transfers to make direct investments abroad are considered on their indi- vidual merits, and portfolio investment abroad is approved only exceptionally. Resident-owned foreign securities quoted on a recognized stock exchange, with the exception of securi- ties issued by foreign investment companies or mutual funds, are freely negotiable between residents, provided that the securities originally were acquired by a resident before Octo- ber 1, 1966, or that they were bought with the proceeds of foreign securities acquired before that date. Transactions in 4 All countries except Albania, Bulgaria, People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Hungary, North Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Rhodesia, Romania, U.S.S.R., and North Viet-Nam. 336 foreign securities between residents against settlement in kro- ner require a license from the Bank of Norway if the securities were not included in an authorized broker's safe deposit for customers on May 31, 1969. Residents may upon application transfer capital abroad to purchase, for recreational purposes, real estate valued at up to NKr 60,000 a family; 5 such pur- chases by business firms, staff associations, etc., are approved liberally, also for higher amounts. In accordance with guidelines of December 13, 1971, the aggregate net foreign liability position of the banks may not deviate by more than NKr 260 million from the position at the end of October 1971, i.e., it must not be less than NKr 555 million or more than NKr 1,075 million. On May 23, 1972, however, these guidelines were modified slightly to allow the banks some additional flexibility in de- termining their net liability position. There are limits on the commercial banks' borrowing abroad. Thus, they may bor- row funds or accept deposits in foreign currency from foreign banks within a ceiling fixed at 20 per cent above their total foreign borrowing at the end of December 1970. Residents other than banks require the prior approval of the Bank of Norway before raising loans, accepting other forms of capital, or incurring or providing guarantee obliga- tions abroad. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form in Norway. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Bank of Norway; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authori- ties and industrial users. No customs duties or other charges or fees are payable on imports or exports of gold bullion and gold coins not contained in jewelry. Domestic sales of gold coins are subject to sales tax at a rate of 20 per cent. Changes during 1973 January 12. The amount of domestic banknotes that travel- ers could take out was increased from NKr 350 to NKr 800. The limit of NKr 1,000 on imports of domestic banknotes by travelers was abolished. February 12. The exchange market was closed. It reopened on February 15. February 15. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Norway maintained the value of its currency in terms of SDRs. The central rate was changed from NKr 6.64539 = US$1 to NKr 5.98086 = US$1, and the intervention points were changed to NKr 5.845 buying, and NKr 6.115 selling, per US$1. March 2. The exchange market was closed. It reopened on March 19. March 19.

An industrial free-trade agreement with the EEC was signed. It came into effect on July 1. May 22. Restrictions were imposed on imports of specified textile products originating in Malaysia. June 20. The de facto prohibition on purchases of Norwe- gian banking and industrial shares by nonresidents was eased administratively, on an experimental basis. Such purchases henceforth could be licensed in minor amounts by the Bank of Norway, on a case-by-case basis. November 2. The National Budget estimated capital in- flows during 1974 at about NKr 1,400 million for the ship- ping sector and about NKr 3,400 million for the petroleum sector, and set a ceiling of NKr 700 million on regulated NORWAY inflows to the rest of the private sector and the municipalities. November 16. The central rate was changed to NKr 1 = SDR 0.145530. December 4. Restrictions were imposed on exports of sawn timber. NOTE.—The following changes took place at the beginning of 1974: January 1. Following the expiration on December 31, 1973 of the bilateral payments agreement, settlements with Eastern Germany took place in convertible currencies. Payments for all current invisibles to Eastern Germany could henceforth be made freely. 337 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution OMAN Exchange Rate System Oman's currency is the Rial Omani which is defined as equivalent to 2.13281 grams of fine gold, corresponding to RO 0.416667 = SDR 1 or RO 1 = US$2.89524. No par value has yet been established. On December 31, 1973, the buying rate for the U.S. dollar was RO 0.342 per US$1 and the selling rate was RO 0.349 per US$1. On the same date, the buying and selling rates for sterling were RO 0.790 and RO 0.910 per £ stg. 1, respectively. Administration of Control There is neither exchange control legislation nor an ex- change control authority in Oman. ports or re-exports of live animals and foodstuffs may be prohibited in times of shortage in Oman. Exports of crude petroleum to the Netherlands and the United States have been suspended. All other commodities may be exported freely. There are no requirements attached to receipts from exports or re-exports; the proceeds need not be repatriated or surrendered, and they may be disposed of freely, regardless of the currency involved. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles Payments for and proceeds from invisibles are not re- stricted. Payments must not, however, be made to or received from Israel or Rhodesia. Travelers may bring in or take out any amount in domestic or foreign banknotes. Prescription of Currency Capital All settlements with Israel and Rhodesia are prohibited. The use of the currencies of Israel and Rhodesia also is pro- hibited. No other prescription of currency requirements are in force. 1 Nonresident Accounts No distinction is made between accounts held by residents and those held by nonresidents. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Israel and Rhodesia are prohibited. Im- ports of a few commodities are prohibited from all sources for reasons of health, morals, or security. Imports of Maria The- resa dollars also are prohibited. Import licenses are not re- quired and exchange for payments abroad may be obtained freely. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Israel and Rhodesia are prohibited and ex- 1 Prior to June 23, 1972 Oman was administratively treated as a Scheduled Territory for purposes of the U.K. Exchange Control Act, 1947. Under current U.K. exchange control regulations, Oman is regarded as a country of the Overseas Sterling Area. No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or payments by residents or nonresidents, except that no payments must be made to or received from Israel or Rhodesia. Investment in business firms in Oman by foreign physical or juridical persons requires prior approval. Gold The monetary authorities and all other residents and non- residents, including private persons, may freely and without license purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form at home or abroad. They may also, without a license and without pay- ment of any customs duties or tax, import and export gold in any form. Transactions involving Israel and Rhodesia, however, are prohibited. Changes during 1973 February. The 'free" rate and the "official" rate for the U.S. dollar were unified. February 20. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the gold parity of the rial omani was maintained unchanged. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously RO 1 = US$2.60571, became RO 1 = US$2.89524. October 17. Exports of crude petroleum to the Netherlands and the United States were suspended. 338 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PAKISTAN Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.0744103 gram of f ine gold per Pakistan Rupee, corresponding to PRs 11.9428 = SDR 1, and Paki- stan avails itself of wider margins. The U.S. dollar is the intervention currency, and the State Bank of Pakistan (the central bank) maintains official rates of PRs 9.90 buying, and PRs 9.9156 selling, per US$1. All transactions in foreign exchange must be conducted through authorized dealers, whose transactions with the general public must be effected at rates authorized by the State Bank. Authorized dealers in Pakistan are permitted to cover their requirements of speci- fied currencies in foreign exchange markets abroad. They may also cover their permitted transactions in specified currencies against U.S. dollars or Pakistan rupees, either spot or forward for a limited period, with their agents in the countries con- cerned. Administration of Control The State Bank has delegated to 21 banks and financial institutions authority to deal in all foreign currencies, to su- pervise surrender requirements, and to sell exchange for spec- ified purposes w i th in limits prescribed by the State Bank. The Chief Controller of Imports and Exports is responsible for the issue of licenses and the implementation of import and export policies. Certain foreign trade transactions are conducted through the Trading Corporation of Pakistan, Ltd., a state trading agency. Prescription of Currency Exchange receipts and payments abroad must be effected through an authorized foreign exchange dealer, in any con- vertible currency or in Pakistan rupees from or to nonresident rupee bank accounts. No exchange control is exercised over transactions w i th Afghanistan, and settlements are made in Pakistan rupees or afghanis. Trade transactions under "barter" agreements are settled through special accounts in inconvertible currencies. Trade in specified commodities w i th Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, North Korea, Poland, Sweden, and the U.S.S.R. is settled through clearing accounts maintained in inconvertible Pakistan rupees. Pay- ments to and from Iran and Turkey relating to visible trade (excluding border trade, Iranian oil, and defense materials) are settled through clearing accounts maintained by the re- spective central banks in U.S. dollars. There is a special trade and payments arrangement with the A.B. Sukab Company of Sweden. Payments between Pakistan and the Republic of China, India, Israel, Rhodesia, and South Africa are suspended. Nonresident Accounts The accounts of individuals, firms, or companies resident in countries outside Pakistan are designated as nonresident accounts. * Authorized banks are permitted to open nonresi- 1 Different rules apply to nonresident rupee accounts of individuals, firms, or companies, on the one hand, and to nonresident rupee accounts of banks, on the other hand. dent accounts for nonbank nonresidents w i thout the prior approval of the State Bank where the accounts are to be opened with funds received from abroad through banking channels or with rupee funds which have been accepted for remittance abroad. Debits and credits to nonresident ac- counts for specified purposes can be made by authorized banks w i thout the prior approval of the State Bank. Accounts of residents of India, other than the accounts of the Indian High Commission and its personnel, are blocked. Pakistan nationals residing abroad and foreign nationals, whether resident abroad or in Pakistan, may open foreign currency accounts with banks in Pakistan without prior ap- proval of the exchange control authorities. There are no re- strictions on the currencies in which the accounts may be denominated and credit balances may be freely transferred abroad. However, a deposit holder wishing to make payments in Pakistan must first convert the foreign exchange drawn from his account into Pakistan rupees. If a Pakistan national holding such an account returns to Pakistan, he may retain the account unless his stay exceeds six months; thereafter the account must be closed and the exchange surrendered. Banks in Pakistan receiving such deposits must sell the foreign ex- change to the State Bank. Imports and Import Payments Permitted imports are classified in two lists: a free list and a tied list. Items on the free list may, in principle, be procured w i thout restriction while items on the tied list may be pro- cured only from tied aid and barter trade sources. Items not on the two lists are effectively prohibited for import except under certain circumstances by export industries, as men- tioned below. Largely for statistical reasons, all imports re- quire licenses, except goods imported by the Central Government for defense or other purposes, goods in transit, personal baggage, certain imports over the land routes from Afghanistan and Iran, and certain other items permitted un- der a M in is t ry of Commerce Notification (No. 335/260/24 of June 12, 1951). Licenses for imports of a value up to PRs 500 incur no fee, but licenses above that amount up to PRs 100,000 are subject to a fee of 1 per cent of the value of the license and licenses above PRs 100,000 are subject to a fee of 2 per cent payable at the time of the issue of the license. The basic two-list import regime is subject to certain sup- plementary qualifications, the most important of which are as follows: (1) Imports from the Republic of China, India, Is- rael, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited, as are im- ports of goods originating in these countries but shipped from third countries. (2) In order to facilitate barter trading and aid utilization and to secure economies through bulk imports, the import of specified items, including seven categories of iron, steel, and metals, is restricted to the Trading Corpora- tion of Pakistan, Ltd., 2 unless the items are procured with 2 With effect from January 10, 1974 the import of su lphur and wood pu lp ceased to be channeled through the Trading Corporation. 339 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PAKISTAN U.S. aid. (3) The import of certain other items, including fertilizers and specified electrical and rail equipment (all from tied sources only) is restricted to the public sector. (4) In conformity with Regional Cooperation for Development ar- rangements between Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey governing procurements from joint industrial ventures, the import of some ten items, including six chemical items, is restricted to procurement from Turkey. (5) Special provisions exist for the import for export industries of tied list items from nontied sources and items not on the two import lists. (6) Private sector importers, other than those importing goods for per- sonal use, who apply for import licenses for goods valued at PRs 20,000 or more must be members of approved trade organizations. (7) Licenses for permissible imports of indus- trial plant and equipment are restricted to a c. & f. value of PRs 500,000 for imports against cash, PRs 1 million for imports under tied credit, and PRs 2 million for imports under bilateral payments arrangements (larger plant and equipment are to be procured under the auspices of the fi- nancing institutions and with the approval of the Ministry of Industries). Except for imports of books, periodicals, and newspapers, irrevocable letters of credit must be opened for all commercial imports. Remittances are not normally permitted before ship- ping documents are received, but in special cases, e.g., ma- chinery and other capital goods for which deposits have to be made with foreign manufacturers, the State Bank may autho- rize advance payments for a part of the value of the goods. No import payments are permitted to be made for goods originating in or consigned from the Republic of China, In- dia, Israel, Rhodesia, or South Africa. Except for specified items, including items on the tied import list, the State Bank requires banks to take a m in imum margin of 25 per cent against import letters of credit. Imports of all commodities, except machinery, tractors and tractor parts, spices, and betel nu ts and leaves, are subject to a "flood relief surcharge" of 25 per cent of the applicable rate of customs du ty. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles are controlled by the State Bank and in many cases require its prior approval. No remittances are permitted to be made to the Republic of China, India, Israel, or Rhodesia. Under authority delegated to them, au- thorized dealers may sell exchange or make remittances in accordance with detailed regulations. Certain remittances of a personal nature are subject to annual quotas, but most are approved at the discretion of the State Bank. Remittances by Pakistan nationals to their families abroad require special authorization. Payments for invisibles connected with imports are gener- ally given the same treatment as that accorded the underlying trade transaction. Transport insurance must, except with re- spect to certain aid shipments, be taken out with insurance companies in Pakistan. The remittance of dividends declared out of current profits is allowed freely to foreign shareholders where the investment was made with the Government's approval. Profits of 340 branches of foreign companies may be remitted freely to their head offices. The same applies to head office expenses charged to a branch's profit and loss account and accepted for tax purposes by the Pakistan income tax authorities. On an ad- ministrative basis, the State Bank approves an exchange allo- cation of US$500 to each applicant for each journey abroad, irrespective of the purpose. Additional exchange for business travel, medical treatment, education, and sponsored cultural trips may be granted on an individual basis. There are also specific allowances for pilgrims' travel to Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries. Nonresident travelers may take out foreign currency not exceeding the amounts they brought in and PRs 20 a person in Pakistan currency notes. Residents leaving for Afghanistan may take out PRs 50 in Pakistan currency notes and coins and any amount of Afghan currency. Persons traveling on Category "A" visas (to India) may not take out any Pakistan currency notes or coins. Residents traveling to other foreign destinations may take out PRs 20 a person in Pakistan cur- rency and any amount in foreign currency notes and travelers checks granted by authorized banks under permissions issued by the State Bank. Pakistan currency notes in denominations of PRs 50 or higher may not be taken out. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of specified commodities to any destination, and all exports to the Republic of China, India, Israel, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. 3 Exports of most other commodities are allowed freely. However, export licenses are required for some 24 listed items, as well as for certain types of sports goods and a few other items subject to minimum export prices, and for mill-made cotton piece goods and ready-made garments intended for export to the United Kingdom. Exports of raw cotton are channeled through the Cotton Export Corporation. The Trading Corporation of Pa- kistan, Ltd., has a monopoly over exports of other specified products. The State Bank exercises control over exchange receipts and requires a declaration by the exporter that, when pay- ment in accordance with the prescribed method is received, he will surrender the exchange within a certain period of time. After making certain that the exporter's declaration meets all conditions, the authorized dealer certifies the export form for shipment. Exporters are obliged to collect and surrender ex- port proceeds within four months; the State Bank may, on the merits of each case, allow an extension of this period. The surrender of Afghan currency accruing from exports to Af- ghanistan is not required. Under a Pay-As-You-Earn Scheme, certain industrial units are permitted to utilize up to 20 per cent of the f.o.b. value of exports for the servicing of suppliers' credit on imports of plant and machinery. 4 Export duties are levied on a range of export items includ- ing raw cotton, cotton yarn, rice, wool, hides and skins, fish meal, and leather shoes. 3 Prohibited exports include beef, mu t ton, grains, flour, dairy products, vegetables, poultry, blood meal, meat meal, corn gluten meal, sesame oil cake, certain citrus fru i ts (unless graded), and certain hides and skins. 4 This scheme was revised early in 1974. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Proceeds from Invisibles With the exception of Afghan currency, which may be retained, incoming foreign exchange derived from invisibles must be surrendered within one month. Persons traveling on Category "A" visas (from India) may not bring in any Pakistan currency notes or coins. Other travelers may bring in PRs 20 in Pakistan currency notes a person and Rs 5 in coins that are legal tender in India; Paki- stan currency notes in denominations of PRs 50 and above may not be brought in. There is no limitation on the import of other currency notes and coins. Capital Investments in Pakistan by nonresidents are subject to approval. In order to encourage industrial development in Pakistan, the Government follows a liberal policy toward foreign entrepreneurs, who can, with the approval of the Government, start any industry in the private sector without any conditions being laid down regarding the participation of local capital. It is, however, expected that local rupee expen- diture will ordinarily be met from local equity capital. 5 Repatriation facilities are as follows: (1) Foreign capital invested in approved industries established after September 1, 1954 may be repatriated at any time thereafter to the extent of the original investment, and current profits may be trans- ferred without restriction, to the country of origin of the capital. (2) Profits that are reinvested in approved industrial projects with the approval of the Government may be treated as investment for the purpose of subsequent repatriation. (3) Appreciation of any capital investment under (1) and (2) may also be treated as investment for the purpose of subsequent repatriation. These repatriation facilities do not apply to the purchase of shares on the stock exchange unless the purchase is an integral part of an approved investment project, or to capital invested in Pakistan before September 1, 1954. Guarantees provide for just and fair compensation in the currency of the country of origin of the investment in the event of nationalization of any project. Foreign nationals in Pakistan or abroad may register their investments in National Prize Bonds issued by the Govern- ment of Pakistan, and thus facilitate repatriation at any time of the principal and the prize winnings. Transfers of capital abroad by resident nationals are, in general, not permitted; the purchase of foreign securities by resident Pakistanis requires approval by the State Bank and is seldom permitted. Detailed rules govern the transfer of capital by persons emigrating or retiring from Pakistan, de- pending upon the nationality of the person concerned and the country or monetary area to which the transfer is to be made. Foreign nationals temporarily residing in Pakistan are treated as nonresidents for purposes of transfer of securities. General 5 The Government announced that, with effect from January 1, 1974, it was acquiring the ownership, management, and control of, and all shares held by private persons in Pakistan in the capital of, domestically owned banks, companies marketing petroleum products, and maritime shipping companies. Foreign-owned shares in these enterprises, and foreign-owned banks and petroleum marketing companies operating in Pakistan were not affected by these measures. However, foreign banks would not be permitted to establish new branches in Pakistan. PAKISTAN permission has been given in connection with the issue, sale, or transfer of securities issued in Pakistan in favor of nonresi- dents, provided the securities are registered in Pakistan and investment is made on the basis of nonrepatriation of capital and return. Pakistan securities held by nonresidents may be transferred to other nonresidents against payment abroad with the same facilities in respect of remittance of capital and earnings as those obtained by the transferor. A general license has also been issued allowing foreign nationals temporarily resident in Pakistan to make investments in units of the Na- tional Investment Trust, subject to certain stipulations. Exports of securities are subject to approval. Proceeds ac- cruing from the liquidation of nonresident capital assets that are not covered by repatriation arrangements may be credited to blocked accounts. Subject to approval by the State Bank, balances on blocked accounts may be invested in approved government securities payable in Pakistan rupees or placed on time deposit with banks. A general permission allows Pakistan nationals resident abroad to acquire securities in Pakistan by remittance of foreign exchange or to the debit of their nonresident accounts in Pakistan; dividends or interest thereon, as well as the pro- ceeds upon sale, must be credited to nonresident accounts and cannot normally be transferred abroad. Pakistan nation- als require the prior approval of the State Bank to sell mov- able or immovable assets held abroad, and the liquidation proceeds must be repatriated to Pakistan through normal banking channels. Gold The export and import of gold is prohibited unless autho- rized by the State Bank. No such permission is granted, but there are no restrictions on the internal sale and purchase of nonmonetary gold. Changes during 1973 During the year a number of items previously prohibited or on the list of tied imports were added to the free list. Several items on the free list were transferred to the tied list. February 5. Authorized banks were permitted to approve remittances of royalty and technical fees without prior ap- proval by the State Bank in amounts consistent with guide- lines established by the State Bank. February 9. Private traders were permitted to import tea under the commodity exchange agreement with Sri Lanka; previously, such imports could be effected only through the Trading Corporation of Pakistan, Ltd. February 12. The limit on foreign banks' underwriting of share issues of companies incorporated in Pakistan was raised from 5 per cent to 10 per cent of the capital offered to the public for subscription. February 16. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Pakistan maintained its par value in terms of gold. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously PRs 11.00 = US$1, became PRs 9.90 = US$1. The State Bank set new official buying and selling rates of PRs 9.90 and PRs 9.9156 per US$1. The State Bank ceased to provide forward exchange cover in respect of imports un- 341 ©International Monetary Fund.

Life insurance policies held abroad in excess of PRs 350,000 were permitted to be renewed for death risks only. June 7. Exports of blood meal, meat meal, corn gluten meal, and sesame oil cake were prohibited. June 28. The Import Policy Order 1973 was issued, which contained the import policy to be effective from July 1, 1973 to June 30, 1974. The Order, which continued the practice of two permitted import lists (the free list and the tied list), provided for some additional import liberalization sh if t ing 35 prohibited items to the free list, and 11 prohibited items to the tied list. The free list contained 356 items, and the tied list 43 items, all other imports being prohibited. Four items were reserved for import by industries under state control, 6 items for import by the public sector, 29 items for import by indus- trial consumers, 15 items for import by the Trading Corpora- tion of Pakistan, Ltd., 10 items for import from Turkey, and 1 item for import from Iraq. The import license ceiling for imports of machinery and capital goods was raised to PRs 500,000 for imports against cash, PRs 1 million for imports under tied loans and credits, and PRs 2 million for imports under bilateral payments agreements.

August 1. The verification of bills of entry or certified in- voices was made the responsibility of the bank through which remittance was made from Pakistan. August 9. Exports of beef, mutton, grains, flour, dairy products, sugar, vegetables, and poultry were prohibited. August 28. Exports of raw cotton were prohibited; the prohibition was lifted on October 11, from which date all exports had to be effected through the intermediary of the Cotton Export Corporation. September 6. Exports of hides and skins, other than lamb- skins, were prohibited. September 15. A flood relief surcharge at a flat rate of 25 per cent of the existing rate of du ty payable was levied on all dutiable import items, except machinery, tractors and tractor parts, spices, and betel nu ts and leaves.

Not for Redistribution PANAMA coconuts, copra, and beef cattle. Merchandise on which ex- port taxes are imposed is also subject to licensing. Export taxes are imposed on gold, silver, platinum, manganese, other minerals, bananas, coconuts, scrap metals, pearls, animal wax, nispero gum, ipecac root, and rubber. Exports of wheat flour, firearms, and ammunition are prohibited. The proceeds of exports are not subject to exchange control. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles These are not restricted, except for most payments to Rho- desia. A travel tax of 4 per cent is levied on air and sea tickets bought in Panama or on such tickets purchased for travelers commencing their journey in Panama. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or payments by residents or nonresidents, except for most payments to Rhodesia. Several foreign-supervised banks are authorized to conduct business only with nonresi- dents. Gold Residents may freely hold gold in any form at home and abroad and may freely negotiate gold in any form with resi- dents or nonresidents at home and abroad. Imports and ex- ports of gold in any form other than jewelry carried as personal effects by travelers are subject to license if made by residents other than the monetary authorities; import licenses are issued freely by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and export licenses by the Ministry of Finance and Treasury. Exports of unworked gold produced in Panama are subject to an export duty of 1 per cent ad valorem, and exports of gold coins (other than U.S. coins, which are exempt) to a duty of Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.736662 gram of fine gold per Panama- nian Balboa, corresponding to B 1.20635 = SDR 1 or B 1.00 = US$1. Panama does not avail itself of wider margins. U.S. currency notes and coins circulate freely in Panama, and local currency is represented only by limited amounts of silver balboas and subsidiary coins and a commemorative 20- balboa silver coin. Exchange transactions by commercial banks are based mainly on New York market quotations. Panama has no exchange restrictions on foreign payments, with the exception of a prohibition on payments to Rhodesia other than those for pensions or for humanitarian, educa- tional, medical, or informational purposes. On November 26, 1946, Panama notified the Fund that it accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control Most import and export licenses are issued by the Price Regulation Office, a semiautonomous institution of the Pana- manian Government. The Price Regulation Office is responsi- ble for the implementation of restrictions on imports of commodities that compete with national production and on certain exports. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry determines the import quotas for commodities listed in trade agreements, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, jointly with the Price Regulation Office, those for agricultural commodities temporarily in short supply. Prescription of Currency No prescription of currency requirements are in force. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Rhodesia are prohibited. Quotas are imposed on imports of commodities competing with present or pro- spective domestic production; some of these are not being licensed. Import licensing also applies to imports of various foods. Other imports are free. Payments abroad may be made freely. A tax of 6 per cent on the f.o.b. value is levied, in addition to import duty, on imports of all dutiable goods other than specified pharmaceutical products and foodstuffs, for which the rate is 2% per cent and 3% per cent, respectively. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Rhodesia are prohibited, except those for hu- manitarian, educational, medical, or informational purposes. Authorization is required for exports of coffee in any form, PARAGUAY Exchange Rate System On March 1, 1956, a new par value for the Paraguayan Guarani was established by Paraguay w i th the Fund. How- ever, exchange transactions no longer take place at rates based on that par value. Exchange transactions take place in a dual exchange market. Transactions in the official exchange market (mercado libre de cambio) must be carried out through the Central Bank (for all government transactions) or an authorized commercial bank; these transactions take place at a rate of 0 126 per US$1, subject to taxes and commissions. Transactions in the fluctuating free market (mercado libre fluctuante de cambio) are conducted through licensed foreign exchange houses at a f luc tua t ing rate which on December 31, 1973 was about 0 131 per US$1 buying, and 0 134 per US$1 selling. All purchases and sales of exchange by banks are subject to a tax of 1V2 per cent, except transactions w i th foreign embassies and diplomats; transactions w i th meat packing plants; and transactions relating to investments in Paraguay that are covered by Law No. 216 of November 9, 1970. In addition, banks charge a commission of 2 per cent on all sales of foreign exchange. There are no forward ex- change facilities. The transactions settled in the official exchange market are exports and imports (except unrecorded border trade), trade-connected current invisibles, all government transac- tions, registered private capital transactions, and related profit remittances. All other transactions are channeled through the fluctuating free market, unless settlements are effected under reciprocal credit agreements w i th LAFTA countries. The authorized banks, but not the exchange houses, are required to sell 30 per cent of their gross foreign exchange receipts in specified currencies * to the Central Bank. Administration of Control The Central Bank of Paraguay determines foreign ex- change policy and supervises the foreign exchange transac- tions carried out by commercial banks and authorized foreign exchange houses. Prescription of Currency There are no prescription of currency requirements. Pay- ments between Paraguay and Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Co- lombia, Mexico, and Peru may be made th rough accounts which the Central Bank of Paraguay and the other central banks concerned ma in ta in w i th each other, within the frame- work of the LAFTA multilateral clearing system. Imports and Import Payments Imports of a few commodities are prohibited. 2 Certain 1 Argen t ine pesos, Belgian francs, Brazilian cruzeiros, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. 2 These include sugar, rice, f lour, and certain other agricultural products and foodstuffs, certain petroleum products, cement, certain textiles, and certain wire and wire products. 344 other items require an import license; these are ma in ly narcot- ics and arms and ammun i t ion. All other imports are free of quan t i ta t ive restriction and licensing. Imports of most com- modities are subject to an advance deposit of 100 per cent of the f.o.b. value, which is retained for 120 days, or if the deposit is made after the date of shipment, 180 days, or for nonexempt commodities imported through the Spanish free zone in Paraguay, 90 days. Advance deposits are not required for, inter alia, public sector imports, imports by foreign diplo- mats and by foreign staff of certain international organiza- tions, fuel and petroleum derivatives, certain machinery, agricultural equipment, wheat, and newsprint from any source, imports from neighboring countries (including Uru- guay), and imports from other LAFTA countries of items included in the Paraguayan concession list (the National List). The Central Bank has authority to grant exemptions on a case-by-case basis. Surcharges, calculated on the c.i.f. value, are payable on most imports even if no foreign exchange payment takes place. An import surcharge of 36 per cent applies to most general imports from any source; however, for goods origi- nating in LAFTA countries and included in the Paraguayan National List the rate ranges from 3 per cent to 30 per cent, and for certain other LAFTA goods (mainly pharmaceuti- cals) in a special list the rate is 8 per cent. Fuel derived from petroleum is subject to a surcharge of 15 per cent (10 per cent for neighboring countries, including Uruguay). There is an additional surcharge of 5 per cent on imports from all sources of telephone and telegraph equipment, television receivers, and radios and record players and their parts and accessories. Commodities that are exempt from surcharge generally are also exempt from advance deposit. These surcharges are collected by the banks at the time of delivery of the documents for customs clearance or when the import payment is made, whichever is earlier. The following are the principal exemptions from surcharge: wheat; crude petroleum; equipment for petroleum exploration and exploi- tation; agricultural tractors; imports for the Government; imports for religious, charitable, cultural, or educational pur- poses; imports by foreign diplomats and certain international organizations; Spanish agricultural and industrial machinery and implements imported through the Spanish free zone in Paraguay; agricultural machinery and equipment for the Na- tional Wheat Program; books and periodicals; and imports for investments under the new Capital Investment Law No. 216. Imports of investment goods and of raw materials for export industries receive exemption on a case-by-case basis. In addition to the above surcharges, a tariff surcharge is levied on certain imports by virtue of Law No. 1334/67, which implemented Decree-Law No. 451 of March 31, 1967, and Law No. 10 of August 29, 1968. On goods that are not exempt, it is 12-24 per cent (8-16 per cent for certain goods subject to LAFTA concessions) and is levied on the c.i.f. value, which is calculated as follows: the f.o.b. value plus 10 per cent for imports from neighboring countries and the f.o.b. value plus 20 per cent for imports from other countries. Ex- ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PARAGUAY empt from th is complementary import du ty are public sector and diplomatic imports; raw materials and equipment for the production of goods that are subject to internal consumption taxes; imports under Capital Inves tment Law No. 216; and all imported goods taxed under the Internal Consumption Tax Law. Furthermore, some goods are subject to the com- plementary import du ty at a reduced rate. Imports that are considered to be of a luxu ry or nonessential character are subject to sales tax at 5 per cent or 10 per cent by v i r tue of Law No. 69/68. In addition to those mentioned above, the following charges are levied on the c.i.f. value of imports: a consular fee of 5 per cent, an import clearance fee of 1 per cent, and a customs surcharge of PARAGUAY nonbank residents and industrial users are eligible; payments for gold imports by industrial users must be made through authorized banks at the official exchange rate, and payments for imports by private persons must be made through ex- change houses at the f luc tua t ing free market rate. Changes during 1973 February 13. Decree No. 30936 reduced import duties on a wide range of goods originating in neighboring countries and exempted such imports from the import surcharge. February 13. Decree No. 30937 reduced the import sur- charge on specified manufactured goods by 50 per cent. February 27. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the Central Bank maintained its spot buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar unchanged, based on 0 126 = US$1. March 16. The introduction of a dual exchange market was authorized by Central Bank Resolution No. 2, Minutes No. 49. The dual market did not come into operation until July 23 (see below). March 31. Decree-Law No. 63 increased the exchange tax on transactions in the official exchange market from 1 per cent to 11/2 per cent and exempted transactions in the secon- dary exchange market from this tax. June 26. Imports of specified agricultural implements were exempted from the import surcharge and from advance im- port deposit requirements. July 13. The Central Bank authorized four foreign ex- change houses to operate in the fluctuating free market (see July 23, below). These exchange houses were permitted to make and receive telegraphic, mail, and telephone transfers; to purchase and sell foreign banknotes and coins, travelers checks, gold coins, gold bars, and gold leaf; and to purchase and issue checks denominated in foreign currency. July 16. The Central Bank authorized commercial banks to accept demand, time, and savings deposits in foreign curren- cies. July 23. A dual exchange market came into operation as foreign exchange houses began to purchase and sell foreign exchange. In the official exchange market, transactions con- tinued to be based on the rate of 0 126 = US$1; in the other market, transactions took place at a fluctuating rate, deter- mined in principle by supply and demand. The transactions settled in the official market were exports (export proceeds corresponding to official surrender prices), imports (other than imports in unrecorded border trade), trade-connected current invisibles, all government transactions, registered pri- vate capital transactions, and related profit remittances. All other permitted transactions took place in the fluctuating free market, unless settlements were effected under a reciprocal credit agreement. Operations in the official market were con- ducted by the Central Bank and the commercial banks, and those in the f luc tua t ing market by licensed exchange houses. The opening rates for the U.S. dollar in the latter market were about 0 132 per US$1. August 1. A reciprocal credit agreement with Bolivia came in to effect. November 13. A General Law for Banks and Other Finan- cial Institutions, Law No. 417, was signed into law. Remit- tances abroad of profits distributed by commercial banks and financial institutions were limited to 30 per cent and those of profits distributed by investment, development, or mortgage banks to 60 per cent. December 14. With effect from January 1, 1974, Decree No. 2373 introduced a customs tariff based on the Brussels Tariff Nomenclature and imposed a tax of 1.5 per cent on most exports. 346 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PERU Exchange Rate System On December 18, 1946, a par value for the Peruvian Sol was established by Peru with the Fund. However, exchange transactions no longer take place at rates based on that par value. There is a dual exchange market with two fixed ex- change rates, an exchange certificate market rate applying to all trade transactions and specified nontrade transactions, including the principal capital movements, and a draft market rate for services and most other nontrade transactions. The foreign exchange requirements of the public sector are met entirely through the certificate market. Export proceeds must be converted into exchange certifi- cates, which are valid for three days and are issued by the Central Reserve Bank of Peru in U.S. dollars only. These exchange certificates may be used, only through the interme- diary of commercial banks, to pay for imports (f.o.b.) and for certain nontrade transactions. Generally, no exchange certifi- cates are issued against export proceeds surrendered by the public sector, nor are certificates used to cover foreign pay- ments of the public sector, since normally the Central Reserve Bank buys and sells foreign exchange direct from and to government agencies at the certificate rate. When approved applications for certificates exceed the supply, the Central Reserve Bank sells foreign exchange at the certificate market rate without any delay. All foreign exchange receipts that are not required to be surrendered at the certificate rate must be sold in the draft market, in which only the government- owned Banco de la Nation and its authorized agents operate. Access to the draft market is controlled and purchases of foreign exchange are permitted only for specified payments not eligible for exchange at the certificate rate. The banks are required to quote a single rate for buying and selling certificates, but they may charge a commission of y4 of 1 per cent, buying and selling, on transactions in the draft market. On December 31, 1973 the certificate market rate was S/. 38.70 per US$1 (buying and selling) and the draft market rate was S /. 43.38 buying and S /. 43.50 selling, per US$1. A stamp tax of 1 per cent is payable on most outward remittances. Peru formally accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from Febru- ary 15, 1961. Administration of Control Export licenses are issued by the Directorate of Foreign Trade in the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. * The Cen- tral Reserve Bank controls the use of certificates for import payments. It also authorizes the use of certificates for non- trade transactions; for profit remittances by branches of for- eign companies, prior approval by the Ministry of Economy and Finance must be obtained in addition. All imports of, and most payments for services by, the public sector require the 1 On January 1, 1974 the Government established the Ministry of Com- merce, to be responsible for activities formerly supervised by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce; the latter was renamed the M in is try of Indu s t ry and Tourism. approval of the Board for Foreign Transactions of the Public Sector and a resolution of the Ministry of Economy and Finance; a similar Board for Foreign Transactions of the Private Sector approves import payments by the private sec- tor on the basis of import authorizations issued by the compe- tent sectoral ministries. Borrowing abroad by the public sector as well as borrowing abroad by the private sector with a government guarantee are subject to prior approval by the High Committee of the External Debt, upon favorable recom- mendation by the National Planning Institute and by the Permanent Commission on External Credits in the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Prescription of Currency In principle, all export proceeds must be received in con- vertible currencies; 2 exchange certificates at present are only issued in U.S. dollars, but the Central Reserve Bank is em- powered to issue certificates denominated in any convertible currency. Settlements in respect of trade transactions with Hungary and Poland must be made through special accounts denominated in U.S. dollars, which have been established under bilateral payments agreements. No other prescription of currency requirements are in force. Payments between Peru and Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela may be made through accounts maintained with each other by the Central Reserve Bank of Peru and the other central banks concerned, within the framework of the LAFTA multilateral clearing system. Imports and Import Payments The import of a number of consumer goods that are consid- ered nonessential is prohibited from any source other than LAFTA countries. Moreover, the import of a large number of manufactures included in the National Register of Manu- factured Products requires the approval of the customs au- thorities, which is granted only in exceptional circumstances. Private sector imports require the prior authorization of the competent sectoral ministry on the basis of an annual import application submitted by the importer. The Board for Foreign Transactions of the Private Sector allocates exchange in ac- cordance with the import applications approved by the sec- toral ministries. Public sector agencies may not place import orders without the prior approval of the Commission on External Transactions and the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Certain agricultural commodities, such as rice and wheat, may be imported only by, or within quotas set by, the Public Company for Agricultural Services (EPSA), and crude petroleum and petroleum derivatives only by PETROPERU, a government agency. Certain industrial raw materials may be imported only by the National Enterprise for Industrial Mar- keting (ENCI), and the National Fertilizer Service (FER- 2 The proceeds must be received in the currency in which the contract is expressed if it is one of the following currencies: Belgian francs, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, or U.S. dollars. Otherwise, export proceeds must be received in U.S. dollars. 347 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PERU TIPERU) has the exclusive right to import and market agricul- tural fertilizers. Payments for the f.o.b. value of private sector imports, whether under documentary letters of credit or on a documentary collection basis, and for interest charges on foreign import credits, may be made at the certificate ex- change rate; however, payments for freight and import-re- lated banking charges other than interest must be made at the draft market rate. Transport insurance contracts for imported goods must be placed with national insurance companies unless a specific exemption from this requirement is obtained from the Banco de la Nacion, in which case premium pay- ments are made at the draft market rate. The full c.i.f. value of public sector imports may be paid with certificates. The use of certificates for import payments requires the prior authorization of the Central Reserve Bank, which pro- vides the foreign exchange to the commercial banks against delivery of the certificates. The commercial banks must pre- sent evidence that the entire amount represented by the certif- icates will be used for the importation of merchandise. The relevant shipping documents and the bill of lading must be forwarded to a commercial bank and presented to the Central Reserve Bank for registration and validation. Submission of import contracts or other evidence support- ing the transaction is required for advance import payments when the shipping documents are not available; in addition, the intermediary bank must provide a guarantee equal to the sol value of the advance payment. If the shipping documents are not presented within 30 days after the utilization of the foreign exchange, the Central Reserve Bank will collect the guarantee and refund this sum only when the required docu- ments have been presented. Minimum credit terms have been prescribed for imports of capital goods valued at over US$10,000 f.o.b. At least 80 per cent of the value of such imports must be financed through loans from suppliers or other foreign creditors or from the Peruvian state develop- ment banks, to be repaid in accordance with minimum credit terms set by the Board for Foreign Transactions of the Pri- vate Sector. The state development banks may only provide such financing for national enterprises and these loans, al- though repayable in soles, must carry an exchange rate guar- antee. The Central Reserve Bank may authorize the sale of exchange certificates only for partial advance payments of up to 20 per cent of the f.o.b. value of private sector capital goods imports (20 per cent of the c.i.f. value for public sector im- ports). These capital goods imports must be covered by irrev- ocable documentary credits and the intermediary bank must guarantee refunding of the foreign currency if the import is not effected by the time the relevant documentary credit ex- pires. A maritime freight tax of 4 per cent of the ocean freight charges is levied on goods imported by sea other than certain agricultural and medical products, books, and coins. Public sector imports must, in principle, be shipped in Peruvian vessels. Payments for Invisibles Authorization is required in order to pay for invisibles w i th certificates or at the certificate rate. The transactions in invisi- 348 bles that are eligible for the certificate market include govern- ment payments, profit remittances by branches of foreign companies operating in Peru, dividend remittances to foreign shareholders (provided that the original investment took place after May 15, 1970 at the certificate rate), and interest payments on those loans for which amortization may be transferred through the certificate market. Remittances of net profits, including depletion and depreciation allowances, re- quire a resolution of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, a prior tax clearance, and the visa of the Central Reserve Bank. Moreover, new foreign investments must be registered with the Ministry of Indus try and Commerce (but see foot- note 1) in order to have access to the certificate market for profit remittances and to enjoy tax incentives under Peru's incentive laws. Remittances of profits on foreign capital in- vested in Peru are limited to 14 per cent a year; foreign-owned enterprises may not pay royalties under new contracts to a foreign parent company or its affiliates; and the effective interest rate on a new loan from a foreign parent company or its foreign affiliate may not exceed by more than 3 per cent the prevailing interest rate for first-class assets in the money market of the country in whose currency the transaction is denominated. Exchange for payments that are not eligible for exchange certificates must be obtained in the draft market, subject to the prior authorization of the Banco de la Nacion. For payments in respect of a large number of current invisi- bles the sale of foreign exchange is authorized freely, either by the Banco de la Nacion or its agents, provided evidence is presented that genuine current payments are involved. These categories include import freight charges, the remuneration of technicians hired abroad, interest on loans for which amorti- zation payments are permitted to be transferred through the draft market, and payments for royalties, patents, trade- marks, insurance premiums, rental income, pensions, and commissions. For certain other payments basic allocations have been established up to which foreign exchange is sold freely. These categories include expenses abroad connected with tourist and business travel, study, and family mainte- nance. The basic limit up to which foreign exchange for tourist travel may be sold is the equivalent of S/. 1,000 a person a day for a maximum of 30 days in any one calendar year for travel to a Latin American country, and of S /. 1,200 a person a day for the same maximum period to other countries. The Banco de la Nacion fixes basic maximum amounts of foreign exchange which may be purchased annually by each eligible company for business travel abroad by its officials. There is a travel tax, which takes the form of a tax on a traveler's acquisition of goods and services abroad (including the cost of passages and fares) of 10 per cent on amounts up to the daily limits specified above, and of 50 per cent on any amounts in excess of these limits; the minimum amount pay- able is S /. 50 a day for each day spent abroad. Exempt are residents traveling on official business and foreign diplomats. The tax is paid prior to departure on the basis of a sworn declaration specifying separately the amount of the fare, the value of anticipated services to be received, and daily ex- penses. Air and sea passages are in addition subject to a 7 per cent ad valorem tax (3 per cent for economy class fares). ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Foreign nationals resident in Peru must obtain a special travel permit for business travel abroad (permiso especial de salida y reingreso). Such permits cost S /. 1,000 and are valid for six months. The export of domestic currency in excess of S/. 1,000 by travelers is prohibited, but the Central Reserve Bank grants exemptions in special circumstances. Exports and Export Proceeds The Banco Minero del Peru has a monopoly over the ex- port of precious metals, uncut precious stones, and pearls, and the Empresa Minera del Peru (MINEROPERU) has a mo- nopoly over all other mineral exports. The Empresa Publica de Comercializacion de Aceite y Harina de Pescado (EPCHAP) has a monopoly over exports of fish meal, fish oil, and fish for human consumption. Coffee exports are controlled by EPSA. Exports of fish meal and fish oil are suspended. 3 All exports are subject to license to assure the necessary supply of export proceeds to the certificate market. Traditional ex- ports must be sold against an irrevocable letter of credit confirmed by a bank established in Peru; the latter must surrender the foreign exchange proceeds within ten working days of payment. In special cases, and with the authorization of the Central Reserve Bank and the Directorate of Foreign Trade, exports may be sold against sight drafts, provided that payment is received w i th in 180 days of shipment. Exporters of nontraditional exports or local handicraft ar- ticles are granted transferable tax credit certificates (CATs) equivalent to 15-30 per cent of the c.i.f. value (of the f.o.b. value when the goods are shipped in foreign vessels). These certificates may be used by the exporter in payment of his tax obligations or may be sold to other taxpayers, who may use them for the same purpose. The Banco de la Nacion adminis- ters an export credit guarantee program and the Industrial Bank provides or arranges export finance for nontraditional exports. Proceeds from Invisibles Most public sector entities other than the state banks must surrender their full receipts at the certificate rate; the excep- tions are earnings from services provided by the Peruvian Shipping Company (Compania Peruana de Vapores or CPV) and the Peruvian Airline Company (AEROPERU), which are eligible for the draft market rate. All other receipts from invisibles must be sold in the draft market. Travelers may not bring in more than S /. 1,000 in Peruvian currency, but the Central Reserve Bank grants exemptions in special circum- stances. Capital All outward capital transfers require prior approval. In addition to government payments, certain capital payments on private account may be effected through the certificate market. The use of exchange certificates may be authorized for the amortization of foreign loans contracted by the private sector, provided that the foreign exchange proceeds of the loan have been surrendered to the Central Reserve Bank. 'These exports were resumed in March 1974. PERU Where such debt was contracted before October 9, 1967, certificate exchange may be allotted by the Central Reserve Bank only to public utility enterprises, to earners of foreign exchange, for payment of debts to international organiza- tions, and for payments of debts guaranteed by the State. Payments in connection with all loans received before June 17, 1971 and not channeled through the certificate mar- ket must be transferred through the draft market. The pro- ceeds of all foreign loans received after June 17, 1971 must be converted in the certificate market; amortization and ser- vice payments in respect of these loans are also settled through the certificate market. All exchange receipts that are not required to be sold in the certificate market must be sold in the draft market. Only the Banco de la Nacion may receive funds originating abroad for deposit to foreign currency accounts maintained in the name of nonresidents; these funds and the accrued interest thereon may be freely disposed of by the depositor and are exempt from income and inheritance taxes until De- cember 31, 1978. Foreign investment in Peru is governed by Decree-Law No. 18900 of June 30, 1971, which ratified the Andean Common Market's policy on the treatment of foreign capital, by De- cree-Law No. 18999 of October 19, 1971, and by Decree-Law No. 19232, Decree-Law No. 19307, Decree-Law No. 19971, and the legislation ruling the Peruvian exchange system. All foreign investments in Peru require the prior approval of the competent authorities with a view to channeling such invest- ments to projects considered essential for the country's devel- opment. If they wish to enjoy for their products the advantages deriving from the duty-free program of the Carta- gena Agreement, foreign companies incorporated in Peru as at July 1, 1971 have to agree, within a period of 3 years, to the gradual acquisition by national investors of shares in such companies so as to transfer them to mixed or national compa- nies during a maximum period of 15 years following the entering into effect of this regime. For this purpose, mixed companies are defined as those in which national investors hold between 51 per cent and 80 per cent of the capital, while national companies are those in which at least 80 per cent of the capital is owned by national investors. Upon expiration of the 3-year period, the participation of national investors in the capital of an enterprise has to amount to not less than 15 per cent; this participation must increase to at least 45 per cent after 10 years and to at least 51 per cent at the end of the 15-year period. In the case of foreign companies estab- lished in Peru after June 30, 1971, the 15 per cent participa- tion by national investors must be secured at the time of the initiation of production. Foreign investments in firms en- gaged in basic industries and in those which export at least 80 per cent of their production to countries outside the An- dean Common Market are exempt from the gradual transfer requirement to mixed companies; however, these enterprises do not benefit from the duty-free program of the Cartagena Agreement. All insurance and reinsurance companies that are not branches of foreign firms must become national enterprises by June 30, 1974, and all insurance and reinsurance compa- 349 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PERU nies established in Peru after July 17, 1973, must be com- pletely owned by national investors. Investment in the mining sector is governed by the General Mining Law (Decree-Law No. 18880) of June 8, 1971, which replaced the Mining Code of May 12, 1950. Companies hold- ing mining concessions may enter into mining contracts with the Government providing for special incentives and guaran- tees or may constitute mixed enterprises with government participation of at least 25 per cent. Under the regime of mining contracts, the Government may grant to m in ing con- cessionaires initiating large-scale investment programs tax incentives and guaranteed availability of foreign exchange for transfers of (1) recovery of investment; (2) interest payments if the rate does not exceed the prevailing rate for similar loans in the financial market from which the loans originate; (3) payments for justified services; and (4) reasonable profit re- mittances, together with guaranteed access to the most favor- able exchange rate. Mixed mining enterprises may receive all the benefits and incentives which may be granted by special contract and, in addition, special tax reductions. Gold The marketing of precious metals and their import and export are governed by Decree-Law No. 18882 of June 15, 1971 and Supreme Decree No. 065-71-EF of the same date. The import and export of gold and certain other precious metals and of precious stones are the monopoly of the Banco Minero del Peru. All imports and exports of gold are settled in the certificate market. The authorities do not make foreign exchange available for imports of gold other than by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and authorized industrial and professional users. Domestic sales and purchases of gold may be carried out by industrial and professional users, pro- vided that they hold licenses issued by the Banco Minero del Peru, but only M INEROPERU is authorized to make the initial purchase of newly mined gold and other precious metals. Residents traveling abroad may not take out jewelry valued at over S/. 50,000 unless it has been registered with the customs (S/. 15,000 for trips to bordering countries). Changes during 1973 During 1973, the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar in both exchange markets remained unchanged. A number of commodities were added to the National Register of Manufactured Products. January 1. Decree-Law No. 19620 of November 28, 1972 came into effect. It replaced the stamp taxes on goods and services with a single ad valorem tax, levied at various rates, on production, imports, exports, wholesaling, and services. The standard rate on exports was 3 per cent, with a reduced rate of 2 per cent for refined and unrefined minerals and a full exemption for nontraditional exports. The standard rate on imports was 15 per cent, with a reduced rate of 1 per cent for some essentials, a rate of 25 per cent for some luxu ry goods, and a full exemption for certain food and livestock items. The rate applicable to international air fares was 7 per cent for first class or 3 per cent for economy class. 350 January 1. Decree-Law No. 19852 of December 26, 1972 came into effect. It introduced a new customs tariff using the customs nomenclature of the Andean Group. The ad valorem import tax of 2 per cent and the 10 per cent import surcharge were consolidated with the existing ad valorem rates. January 23. Decree-Law No. 19897 introduced the require- ment of a special travel permit for business travel abroad by foreign nationals resident in Peru. March 9. Ministerial Resolution No. 257-73-EF/74 ex- empted those mining companies whose taxes were fixed under contracts w i th the Government of Peru, from the import and export taxes imposed by Decree-Law No. 19620 of Novem- ber 28, 1972. March 21. Supreme Resolution No. 0033-73-PE lifted the suspension of exports of fish meal and fish oil that had been imposed on October 1, 1972, and required that 30 per cent of the quan t i ty exported must be reserved for the fu lf i l lment of contracts signed prior to October 1, 1972. March 23. Central Reserve Bank Circular No. 08-73- EF/90 required tha t, when loans and other external financial obligations fa l l ing under the certificate market regime were contracted in Belgian francs, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, or Swiss francs, or when export proceeds were received in one of these currencies, the currency in which the transaction was effected must be turned over to the Central Reserve Bank for conver- sion at the certificate market rate. April 3. Decree-Law No. 19971 authorized the state devel- opment banks to utilize foreign lines of credit previously approved by the Central Reserve Bank, in order to finance capital goods imports by national enterprises, i.e., companies in which at least 80 per cent of the capital is owned by national investors. These loans to national enterprises had to conform to the m in imum credit terms for capital goods im- ports established by the Board for Foreign Transactions of the Private Sector and, although repayable in soles, had to carry an exchange rate guarantee. April 13. Decree-Law No. 19988 provided that the opera- tions of decentralized public bodies engaged in foreign busi- ness in the fields of trade, finance, and industry could be governed by the practices of international commerce and by the rules of in terna t ional law, without prejudice to the current system of approval in Peru. Thus Peruvian national law now recognized expressly that the decentralized public bodies (the Central Reserve Bank, the Banco de la Nacion, the state development banks, and other public organizations that con- clude external financial agreements) could accept the laws and courts of a foreign country, whether the country with which the contract was concluded or any th ird countries chosen by the contracting parties. A basic condition was that these contracts were concluded outside Peru. State contracts concluded in Peru w i th foreign untertakings continued to be affected by Article 17 of the Constitution, which requires foreign companies and persons who contract w i th the state to acknowledge the laws and tribunals of Peru. The decree-law did not affect contracts made by the Cen- tral Government or by the local governments (municipal- ities), even if these were represented by their financial agent, the Banco de la Nacion. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution April 17. Supreme Decree No. 008-73-IC/DC gave the Na- tional Fertilizer Service (SENAFER) the exclusive right to im- port and market agricultural fertilizers. May 8. Decree-Laws Nos. 19999 and 20000 were published which nationalized all firms engaged in anchovy f ish ing or in the production of fish meal and fish oil. A state agency, PESCAPERU, was established with certain monopoly func- tions in the fisheries sector. May 15. Decree-Law No. 20019 stipulated that transport insurance contracts for private sector imports must be ob- tained from national insurance companies, unless a specific exemption from this requirement was obtained from the Banco de la Nacion. Public sector imports had to be insured through the Banco de la Nacion. When private sector import insurance policies were written in a foreign currency by na- tional companies, the premiums had to be paid at the draft market rate but any foreign exchange received in payment of claims had to be turned over to the Central Reserve Bank and converted at the certificate rate. All foreign exchange transac- tions resulting from public sector import insurance were ef- fected at the certificate rate. The Banco de la Nacion could authorize national insurance and reinsurance firms to open foreign exchange accounts with it and these accounts would be governed by the regulations of the draft market. May 22. Decree-Law No. 20030 shifted the foreign cur- rency earnings of the national airline AEROPERU from the certificate market to the draft market. (Similar action had been taken for the CPV by Decree-Law No. 19586 of October 24, 1972.) May 22. Decree-Law No. 20031 (which amended Article 9 of Decree-Law No. 17710) and Supreme Decree No. 092-73-EF (which amended Articles 18 and 20 of the regula- tions of Decree-Law No. 17710) stipulated that payments for the f.o.b. value of private sector imports and for interest charges on foreign import credits could be made at the certifi- cate exchange rate, while payments for freight and im- port-related banking charges other than interest had to be made at the draft market rate. The full c.i.f. value of public sector imports, however, could be paid with exchange certifi- cates. (Before May 15, 1973, the full c.i.f. value of private sector imports was also eligible for transfer at the certificate rate.) In the case of advance payments for imports without the relevant shipping documents and bill of lading, the import contracts and other documents supporting the transaction had to be presented to the Central Reserve Bank and the intermediary bank had to grant a guarantee equal to the sol value of the advance payment. If the shipping documents were not presented within 30 days after the utilization of the foreign exchange, the Central Reserve Bank would collect the guarantee and refund this sum only after the required docu- ments had been presented. In the case of capital goods im- ports, the Central Reserve Bank could only authorize partial advance payments of up to 20 per cent of the f.o.b. value (20 per cent of the c.i.f. value for public sector imports). The capital goods imports must be covered by an irrevocable documentary credit and the pertinent sales contract; the bank filing the application had to guarantee the refunding of the PERU foreign currency if the goods had not been imported by the time the relevant documentary credit expired. Salaries and other payments for services contracted abroad were to be transferred at the draft market rate, unless the services were contracted by or for a public sector entity. (Previously, technicians' salaries and other such payments were transferred at the certificate rate.) Exchange certificates could be used for the payment of interest on foreign borrow- ing by exporting firms (provided the proceeds of the loan were submitted to the Central Reserve Bank on account of fu tu re exports) and for the local office administrative expen- ditures of international credit institutions (provided prior documentation of mon th ly expenses had been submitted to the Central Reserve Bank). May 29. Supreme Decree No. 095-73-EF provided that insurance firms established in Peru could issue policies in foreign currencies for transport insurance on imports and exports, for insurance contracted by nonresidents when the premiums were paid in foreign currency, for insuring capital goods financed by suppliers' credits when the supplier so required, and for other justified cases authorized by the Banco de la Nacion. This supreme decree also set for th the conditions governing the operation of foreign currency ac- counts held by insurance and reinsurance firms with the Banco de la Nacion. May 29. Decree-Law No. 20036, containing a new organic law for PETROPERU, was published. May 30. Decree-Law No. 20035, containing a new organic law for M INEROPERU, was published. July 17. Decree-Law No. 20088 provided that insurance and reinsurance companies that were not branches of foreign companies must reduce foreign shareholdings to 20 per cent or less of their total share capital by June 30, 1974. All insurance and reinsurance companies established in Peru after July 17, 1973, had to be 100 per cent owned by national investors. Investment and reinvestment by insurance compa- nies were subject to Article 42 of Decree-Law No. 18900 of June 30, 1971, which ratified the Andean Common Mar- ket's policy on the treatment of foreign capital. Insurance and reinsurance companies with foreign shareholdings greater than 20 per cent of their subscribed capital could only effect their foreign exchange operations through accounts main- tained with the Banco de la Nacion. July 31. Decree-Law No. 20104 allowed businesses provid- ing tourist services to pay only part of the customs du ty on imported equipment. Such businesses in the Lima-Callao area would pay 30 per cent of the normal du ty, and those outside this area 15 per cent. August 7. Decree-Law No. 20107 empowered the Central Reserve Bank to regulate any commissions charged by banks for the purchase and sale of exchange certificates in their role as agents for the Central Reserve Bank. August 28. Decree-Law No. 20125 appointed the Banco de la Nacion as the only banking institution authorized to re- ceive funds originating abroad for deposit to foreign currency accounts maintained in the name of nonresidents. These funds and the accrued interest thereon could be freely dis- posed of by the depositor and would be exempt from income and inheritance taxes until December 31, 1978. 351 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PERU September 11. Decree-Law No. 20138 guaranteed that firms which, by virtue of contracts w i th the Government of Peru, have access to the certificate market for the payment of principal and interest on foreign loans used to finance invest- ment in Peru, could continue to effect these payments through the certificate market if their contract w i th the Gov- ernment expired before the loan matured. These payments would be governed by the certificate market regulations in effect on the date the contract was signed. October 2. Decree-Law No. 20165 introduced a new gen- eral customs law to become effective July 1, 1974. October 30. Decree-Law No. 20194 established an agency responsible for the production, marketing, export, and import of fertilizer (FERTIPERU). This agency took over the functions of SENAFER, which was merged into it. October 30. Decree-Law No. 20203 authorized COFIDE (the development finance corporation), subject to the prior approval of the Central Reserve Bank, to lend foreign cur- rency, against funds taken up abroad, to public enterprises and to national private enterprises for import payments, as well as to use external credits to make payments abroad for services required by public enterprises. November 7. Supreme Resolution No. 0213-73-PE sus- pended exports of fish meal and fish oil and canceled all outstanding export contracts for fish meal and fish oil. December 11. Decree-Law No. 20317 defined the functions of the Empresa Nacional de Turismo (ENTURPERU). December 18. Decree-Law No. 20488 created a new Minis- try of Commerce. December 26. Supreme Decree No. 346-73-EF was issued, containing new rules for the customs valuation of imports and exports. 352 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PHILIPPINES Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.227864 gram of fine gold per Philippine Peso, corresponding to P 1 = SDR 0.256410. All exchange transactions take place in a free market. The Bankers' Associ- ation establishes daily a "guiding rate"; during 1973 this rate appreciated from P 6.78 to about P 6.74 per U.S. dollar. In spot transactions with their customers, commercial banks are required by the Association to observe certain margins. The maximum and minimum spot buying rates are l/2 of 1 per cent and 1 per cent below the guiding rate, respectively. The mini- mum and maximum spot selling rates are % of 1 per cent and 1 PHILIPPINES Payments for Invisibles Virtually all payments to Rhodesia are prohibited. In prin- ciple, all other payments are permitted, without prior ap- proval of the Central Bank, provided that amounts of more than US$100 are substantiated by documentary evidence re- garding the purpose and the amount applied for. However, there are certain limits and regulations established by the Central Bank for purchases of foreign exchange for travel abroad by residents, remittances for educational expenses, maintenance and expenses of dependents abroad of residents, remittances of profits, dividends, and interest, royalties, and film and other rentals (see below). Exchange for travel abroad is made available as follows: (1) US$25 a day, up to a maxi- mum of US$750 a trip (for exporters an additional represen- tation allowance of US$500) for each person for business or professional travel; (2) US$500 a year for each adu lt resident for nonbusiness travel to Africa, North and South America, Australia, Europe, Japan, the Middle East, and New Zealand; and (3) US$200 a year for each adult resident for nonbusiness travel to Guam, Hong Kong, Okinawa, the Re- public of China, or any other neighboring country. Foreign travel by Philippine citizens, however, is not normally permit- ted. The following limits apply to exchange for educational expenses abroad: for studies in the United States, US$250 a month for living and other out-of-school expenses, plus the cost of tu i t ion, books, laboratory fees, and other school charges; for studies in Australia, Europe, Japan, and New Zealand, US$200 a month; and for studies in other areas, US$150 a mon th. Any scholarship allowances are deducted from these amounts. Remittances for educational expenses and student maintenance abroad are allowed only to students working for a degree at duly accredited colleges or universi- ties. The following limits apply for remittances to dependents of residents: US$250 a month for each dependent living in the United States; US$200 a month for each dependent living in Australia, Europe, Japan, and New Zealand; and US$100 a month for each dependent living in other areas. The mainte- nance allowances for dependents are allowed only for close relatives under certain conditions prescribed by the Central Bank. Remittances of profits and dividends (net of taxes) accru- ing to nonresidents out of net profits realized beginning Janu- ary 1, 1973, are permitted in full, provided that remittances are not financed from domestic credit resources. Remittances of royalties or rentals on patents, trademarks, and copyrights are freely permitted (net of taxes) for contracts registered with the Central Bank, provided that (1) the royalties do not ex- ceed 5 per cent of the wholesale price of the commodity which is manufactured locally under the royalty contract (2 per cent in the case of marketing service contracts), and (2) contracts do not exceed five-year terms and do not include restrictions on the export of the product. Remittances of the producer's shares of earnings made on motion-picture films and rentals on television films are freely permitted, provided generally that the shares or rentals do not exceed 60 per cent of net proceeds from films. 354 Foreign exchange within the above limits may be pur- chased, without prior approval of the Central Bank, for cur- rent payments for invisibles administratively withheld prior to November 26, 1969. Applications for certain invisibles for which no basic allowance has been set are considered on their merits by the Central Bank. No person may take out or export from the Philippines foreign currency or any other foreign exchange except as authorized by the Central Bank. Residents may take out, as part of their travel allowance, up to US$100 in foreign bank- notes. Nonresident travelers may take out any amount of foreign currency that they had previously brought in and declared, m inus any amounts converted into pesos. Resident and nonresident travelers require prior authorization from the Central Bank to take out more than P 500 in domestic notes and coins or checks, money orders, and other bills of exchange drawn in pesos. Citizens of the Philippines and permanent resident aliens, when traveling abroad, must pay a travel tax of P 400 for first-class ship or plane tickets or P 300 for any other ticket. Exempt are, among others, foreign diplomatic staff and Filipino Muslims making their first pil- grimage to Mecca. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Rhodesia of petroleum products and military equipment and supplies are prohibited. Exports of certain strategic materials and items deemed essential for industrial- ization and economic development are also prohibited. Oth- erwise, exports are generally not restricted, but they are regulated to ensure that the foreign exchange proceeds are surrendered to an authorized agent of the Central Bank. Au- thorized agent banks issue the necessary export permits upon registration of the exporter's report of foreign sales (except export permits for gold, which are issued by the Central Bank); reports of foreign sales for copra and coconut oil, however, are approved for registration only by the Central Bank. Authorized agent banks must sell to the Central Bank 10 per cent of their exchange receipts from export bills. As a general rule, no commodity may be exported unless it is covered by a draft drawn in one of the prescribed curren- cies and unless collection of the proceeds will be undertaken by an authorized agent bank; however, payment by means of telegraphic transfer, check, or mail transfer may be allowed. Payments for exports on a cash, collection, or consignment basis must be arranged through an authorized agent bank, which must specifically contract with the exporter to buy the exchange proceeds. No shipment of exports will be allowed by the customs unless a certificate is issued by a bank stating that payment has been received or arranged by the bank. Proceeds from exports must be received in the prescribed currencies within 30 days from the date of shipment (or within such period as may be established in special cases) and surrendered to the agent bank within 3 business days of re- ceipt. An irrevocable letter of credit is required for exports of scrap metals, copra, and coconut oil, and for all exports to Guam, Hong Kong, the Republic of China, Indonesia, and Japan. Exports of perishable commodities to Hong Kong require prepayment. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Under an "export deduction" scheme, export-oriented in- dustries are allowed, subject to the prior approval of the Central Bank, to use a part of their export proceeds for the repayment of the loans obtained for their imports of machin- ery, equipment, raw materials, and other requirements. An export tax is levied on the f.o.b. value of major exports. The rate is 10 per cent for logs, 6 per cent for copra, centrifu- gal sugar, and copper ore and concentrates, and 4 per cent for gold, molasses, coconut oil, dessicated coconut, iron ore and concentrates, chromite ore and concentrates, copra meal or cake, unmanufactured abaca, unmanufactured tobacco, ve- neer core and sheets, plywood, lumber, canned pineapples, shrimps and prawns, bunker fuel oil, bananas, cement clinker, Portland cement, and petroleum pitch and residues. Export trade with socialist and communist countries au- thorized under Executive Order No. 384 is handled through NETRACOR. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles must be sold within three business days by the recipient to an authorized agent bank. Philippine nationals employed abroad are permitted to open U.S. dollar deposit accounts with the Central Bank or authorized agent banks, in which they may retain any U.S. dollars they remit to the Philippines. To be eligible for credit to such accounts at the Central Bank, earnings must be transferred through Philippine diplomatic or consular establishments. Under a foreign currency deposit scheme, inward remittances by resi- dents or nonresidents of foreign currencies for deposit in numbered foreign currency accounts are exempt from surren- der requirements, provided that the remittances do not repre- sent current earnings or income of residents nor payments by nonresidents pursuant to contractual obligations. Balances in such accounts are freely transferable abroad. Travelers may freely bring in any amount of foreign currency and up to P 500 in domestic notes and coins and checks, money orders, and other bills of exchange drawn in pesos, of which not more than P 50 may consist of Philippine coins. Capital All inward and outward capital movements, w i th the ex- ception of certain transactions related to financing of interna- tional trade (see below), are subject to the prior and specific approval of the Central Bank. Virtually all payments and transfers to Rhodesia are prohibited. For the purpose of the approval of new inward foreign investments (in kind or in cash) as well as new foreign borrowings, preference is given to projects approved by the BOI, export-oriented industries, and other (nonexport-oriented) industries not utilizing do- mestic credit resources. Foreign direct cash investments made after March 15,1973 and registered with the Central Bank are freely repatriable, except investments in domestic commercial banks, which if made after March 31, 1973, are freely repatri- able and if made before that date are repatriable according to the schedule in (4) below. There are certain restrictions on sales of foreign exchange for the repatriation of foreign direct cash investments made before March 16, 1973 and non-cash investments made after March 15, 1973, depending on the PHILIPPINES category of industry where the investment is made, as follows: (1) export-oriented industries certified by the Central Bank— repatriable in fu ll but no annual installment to exceed the applicant's share in the net foreign exchange earnings of the firm in the preceding year; (2) enterprises registered with the BOI, producing import substitutes or exports but not in- cluded in (1) above —repatriable in three equal annual install- ments starting one year after the liquidation of investment, but no annual installment to be more than total net foreign exchange earnings in the preceding year; (3) enterprises regis- tered with the BOI, not included in (2) above and not utilizing domestic credit resources—in four equal annual installments starting one year after liquidation of investments; (4) remain- ing industries —repatriation according to the following sched- ule: US$0.25 million or less, five equal annual installments after liquidation; USSO.25-0.5 million, seven equal annual installments after liquidation; and over US$0.5 million, nine equal annual installments after liquidation. During the period between the date of investments and repatriation, liquidation proceeds may be reinvested, subject to approval by the Cen- tral Bank, in foreign currency deposits under Circular No. 343, government securities, or shares of stock in export-ori- ented industries registered with the BOI or certified by the Central Bank. Commercial banks may not receive credit from abroad other than credit arising from normal international trade transactions. Residents may obtain suppliers* credits from abroad provided that repayment terms are w i th in the limits prescribed by the Central Bank. The ma tur i ty may not be less than 5 years for amounts up to $250,000 (with certain excep- tions) not less than 8 years for amounts between $250,000 and $500,000 and not less than 12 years for amounts greater than $500,000. For export industries, amounts exceeding $500,000 are approved if the credit has a maturity of at least 8 years, inclusive of a 3-year grace period on repayment of principal; and for amounts less than US$ 150,000, 3 or 4 year maturities may be permitted depending on the amount of credit and the type of export indus try. Interest rates may not be more than 2 per cent above the prime rate of the lending country. Appli- cations are not approved if the proposed project expands capacity in an indus try deemed to be overcrowded, or for firms which are in arrears with government financial institu- tions. Sales of foreign exchange for amortization of loans are permitted in accordance with the terms of loan contracts approved by the Central Bank. The same applies for loan contracts registered with the Central Bank prior to Novem- ber 26, 1969. For those not falling under these two categories, prior approval by the Central Bank is required for sales of foreign exchange for repayment of loans. Emigrants may repatriate up to US$5,000, subject to verifi- cation by the Central Bank. The remaining liquid assets may be w i thdrawn in five years beginning one year from emigra- tion. Except as otherwise specifically authorized, resident per- sons, firms, or corporations may not enter into any contract or transaction which may involve settlement in foreign ex- change, or involving any assets belonging to them expressed in foreign currencies or payable or deliverable abroad. This restriction also applies to contracts or transactions involving 355 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PHILIPPINES assets w i th in the Philippines belonging to a nonresident per- son, firm, or corporation, and to their exportation or importa- tion. Detailed regulations are in force concerning transactions in securities between residents and nonresidents. Under the Investment Incentives Act of 1967, all investors in enterprises registered with the BOI are guaranteed the right to repatriate their investments, and to remit earnings thereon and sums needed to meet payments of principal and interest on foreign loans; they are also guaranteed freedom from ex- propriation and requisition. There are different arrangements for "pioneer investments" and "preferred investments"; the former are granted certain incentives over and above those given to preferred investments. Normally, enterprises owned or controlled by foreigners are permitted to operate only in "pioneer areas of invest- ment," and normally at least 60 per cent of the voting capital stock of registered enterprises in "preferred areas of invest- ment" (mainly investments related to the exploitation of ex- port-oriented natural resources and the manufac tur ing of import substitutes) must be owned by Philippine nationals. By virtue of the Laurel-Langley Agreement, U.S. citizens, corporations, and associations are given the same status for this purpose as Philippine citizens until July 1974. Under the Foreign Investment Law of 1968, new enter- prises in which investment by non-Filipinos exceeds 30 per cent and which are not covered by the Investment Incentives Act must obtain au thor i ty from the BOI in order to engage in any economic activity in the Philippines. If purchases of shares of common stock by foreign nationals would reduce Philippine ownership in a firm to less than 30 per cent, per- mission from the BOI must first be obtained. Gold Producers of gold must sell their entire ou tput to the Cen- tral Bank at the equivalent of US$42.22 an ounce (calculated at P 3.90 per U.S. dollar) to be eligible for assistance under the Gold Indus t ry Assistance Act (Republic Act No. 3089, as amended by Republic Act No. 6364 of August 5, 1971), irrespective of whether this gold is a by-product or the princi- pal or only product of their operations. However, gold pro- ducers who wish to take advantage of the floating exchange rate (the "guiding rate") in lieu of the subsidy must export their gold production, subject to prior licensing by the Cen- tral Bank. Exports of gold (as principal product) are subject to an export tax at a rate of 4 per cent. Residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to purchase gold abroad in any form other than jewelry. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Central Bank; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and in- dustrial users. Changes during 1973 January 1. A revised customs tariff based on the Brussels Tariff Nomenclature went into effect. The basic rates of du ty were 10, 20, 30, 50, 70, and 100 per cent. The President was empowered, acting on the advice of the newly created Na- 356 tional Economic Development Authority, to adjust the rates of import du ty, and to introduce protective duties, import quotas, and import prohibitions. January 1. Export proceeds from shrimps and prawns and from gold became subject to the stabilization tax at the rate of 4 per cent. January 17. Authorized agent banks no longer were per- mitted to reconvert in to U.S. dollars any portion of the peso proceeds of U.S. Treasury dollar checks encashed by Philip- pine residents holding "privilege and ration cards." February 14. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the "guiding rate" was maintained unchanged at about P 6.78 = US$1. February 16. Payments for the import of completely knocked-down new as well as used motorcycles for assembly and of spare or replacement parts for motorcycles were made subject to prior approval by the Central Bank. February 19. Presidential Decree No. 131 reduced the with- holding tax on interest on foreign loans from 35 per cent to 15 per cent for interest earned beginning from January 1, 1973. February 26. Central Bank Circular No. 364 required resi- dent persons and corporations to remit to the Philippines in foreign currencies acceptable to the Central Bank all foreign exchange earnings from invisibles, whether receivable in the Philippines or through representatives abroad, within 15 days from the date of establishing ownership. Only amounts eligi- ble for deposit under the foreign currency deposit scheme were exempt from this requirement. Regulations were issued for the reporting to the Central Bank by resident persons or corporations of all foreign exchange earnings from invisibles. March 16. Central Bank Circular No. 365 provided that foreign investments made after March 15, 1973 and registered with the Central Bank were freely repatriable. The Central Bank issued revised regulations governing repatriation of for- eign investments existing as of March 15, 1973 in different categories of industries as follows: (1) export-oriented indus- tries certified by the Central Bank —repatriable in full but no annual installment to exceed the applicant's share in the net foreign exchange earnings of the firm in the preceding year; (2) enterprises registered with the BOI, producing import substitutes or exports but not included in (1) above—repatri- able in three equal annual installments starting one year after the liquidation of investment, but no annual installment to be more than the total net foreign exchange earnings in the preceding year; (3) enterprises registered with the BOI, not included in (2) above and not utilizing domestic credit re- sources—in four equal annual installments starting one year after liquidation of investments; (4) remaining industries — repatriation according to the following schedule: US$0.25 million or less, five equal annual installments after liquida- tion; US$0.25-0.5 million, seven equal annual installments after liquidation; and over US$0.5 million, nine equal annual installments after liquidation. During the period between the liquidation of investments and repatriation, liquidation proceeds could be reinvested, subject to approval by the Central Bank, in foreign currency deposits under Circular No. 343, government securities, or ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution shares of stock in export-oriented industries registered w i th the BOI or certified by the Central Bank. March 16. Central Bank Circular No. 365 removed the limit of 25 per cent of the equity participation (net of taxes) on the remittance of profits and dividends earned in certain industries. Profits and dividends accruing to nonresidents out of net profits realized beginning January 1, 1973 and thereafter could, net of taxes, be remitted in fu ll at the prevailing ex- change rate. The backlog of profits and dividends resulting from the 25 per cent restriction was remittable subject to two conditions: (1) the remittance should not be financed by do- mestic borrowing, and (2) depending on the amount, the Central Bank might stagger the remittance over a period of two years. March 16. Resolution No. 470 of the Monetary Board permitted local banks to swap certain foreign cash invest- ments w i th the Central Bank for pesos, but w i thout forward cover, for a m in imum period of three months and a maximum period of three years. Included in this were foreign cash in- vestments made after March 15, 1973 in (1) export-oriented industries certified by the Central Bank, (2) enterprises regis- tered with the BOI, or (3) Philippine securities approved by and registered with the Central Bank and listed on the local stock exchange. Such cash investments were repatriable in full, minus any losses, at any time, subject to the terms and conditions of the swap arrangement between the handling bank and the Central Bank. April 4. All exports of grains and their by-products were banned, except for scientific and experimental purposes as approved by the National Grain Authority. Exports of ipil- ipil, feather meal, and yeast were also banned, except as au- thorized by the Secretary of Agriculture. May 28. Central Bank regulations governing the required m in imum repayment periods for suppliers' credits from abroad were relaxed for (1) export-oriented industries certi- fied by the Central Bank and industries registered with the BOI under the Export Incentives Act, and (2) pioneer indus- tries approved by the BOI and enterprises engaged primarily in producing for exports, as follows: In category (1)— amounts up to US$50,000, three years; over US$50,000 to US$150,000, four years; and over US$150,000 to US$250,000, f ive years. In category (2) —up to US$25,000, three years; over US$25,000 to US$100,000, four years; and over US$100,000 to US$250,000, five years. Formerly, mini- mum five-year repayment terms were required for all credits up to US$250,000. June 16. Presidential Decree No. 218 introduced incentive guidelines for the establishment in the Philippines of regional headquarters by multinational corporations. July 1. The stabilization tax of 6 per cent or 4 per cent on proceeds from certain major exports was replaced by an ex- port tax at the same rates, with the exception that the tax rate for logs was raised from 6 per cent to 10 per cent. Since the stabilization tax involved multiple currency practices, this action implied the unification of the exchange rate structure. August 7. The Central Bank issued guidelines regarding the implementation of quantitative restrictions being imposed on PHILIPPINES the export of cement, plywood, lumber, copra, and coconut oil. August 8. Circular No. 375 of the Central Bank established regulations governing the repatriation of foreign investments (including investments in foreign exchange by nonresident Philippine citizens) in domestic commercial banks, as follows: (1) Investments existing as of May 31, 1973 as approved by and registered with the Central Bank would be repatriable according to the following schedule: US$0.25 million or less, five equal annual installments after liquidation; over US$0.25 to US$0.5 million, seven equal annual installments after liqui- dation; and over US$0.5 million, nine equal annual install- ments after liquidation. (2) Cash investments made after May 31, 1973 and after approval by and registration with the Central Bank would be repatriable in full, minus any losses, at any time at the prevailing exchange rate. August 9. The Philippines acceded provisionally to the GATT. August 21. All payments for freight charges for imports loaded on board Philippine flag vessels and /or alien flag vessels operated or chartered by Philippine residents were permitted to be made in the Philippines in pesos or U.S. dollars. Philippine resident operators or charterers were re- quired to accept pesos offered as payment in the Philippines for such freight. October 15. Central Bank Circular No. 265, as amended, permitted resident individuals and firms to export and im- port, and permitted travelers to take out or bring in, up to P 500 in Philippine notes and coins or checks, money orders, and other bills of exchange drawn in pesos. For larger amounts, prior authorization from the Central Bank was re- quired. October 26. The Central Bank took steps to ensure advance scrutiny of all foreign borrowing by official financial institu- tions. November 8. Exports of all petroleum products, with the exception of limited sale of fuel to foreign ships and airlines, required prior authorization by the Oil Industry Commission. November 20. The stipulation that remittance of the back- log of profits and dividends from 1972 and preceding years might be staggered by the Central Bank over a two-year period was withdrawn. Immediate lump sum remittance was to be permitted for all applications made before January 31, 1974, provided that actual remittance was made before April 1, 1974. However, the condition prohibiting the use of domestic credit to finance the remittance was retained. December 7. The 50 per cent limitation on the remittance of royalties or rentals on patents, trademarks, and copyrights was removed for contracts registered with the Central Bank and the full amount, net of taxes, became freely remittable provided that (1) the contracts did not exceed five-year terms and did not include restrictive terms regarding export of the product, and (2) the "manufacturing" royalty rate did not exceed 5 per cent (2 per cent in case of "marketing" services such as brand names or trademarks) of the wholesale price of product. A similar 50 per cent limit on the remittance of the producer's shares of earnings made on motion-picture films and rentals on television films was also removed, provided generally that the shares or rentals did not exceed 60 per cent 357 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PHILIPPINES of net proceeds from films. However, the Monetary Board, in consultation with the BOI, could waive these conditions. Any existing contracts would be given full remittance rights, in- eluding unremitted amounts under former regulations. 358 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PORTUGAL Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.0309103 gram of fine gold per Portu- guese Escudo. A central rate of Esc 25.50 per US$1 has been established, corresponding to Esc 30.7619 = SDR 1, and Portugal avails itself of wider margins. Since March 19, 1973, however, no announced margins have been observed and all spot transactions between the escudo and other currencies (except those of the overseas provinces) have taken place at fluctuating rates. On December 31, 1973, the authorized banks' buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were Esc 25.728 and Esc 25.956, respectively, per US$1. Neither the Bank of Portugal nor the commercial banks charge buy- ing and selling commissions but there is a tax of 0.15 per cent on all sales of foreign exchange. l For settlements w i th countries with which Portugal has bilateral payments agree- ments, 2 the U.S. dollar rate applies to transactions in "agree- ment dollars," while fixed exchange rates apply to other agreement currencies. Authorized banks may deal in foreign exchange with the Bank of Portugal. They are also normally allowed to deal in foreign exchange with banks abroad at the rates prevailing in the Portuguese foreign exchange market, but they are not expected to solicit such transactions in foreign markets and may be required to jus t ify the amounts of their sales of escu- dos to nonresidents. They are not allowed to buy and sell foreign exchange among themselves, or to enter into arbitrage operations in foreign markets. In dealing with their custom- ers, the authorized banks buy and sell foreign exchange in convertible currencies for their own account; their purchases and sales of bilateral agreement currencies are made for the account of the Bank of Portugal. Purchases and sales of un- quoted currencies can only be made through an authorized bank acting on a commission basis. Banks are required to obtain the prior approval of the Bank of Portugal to accept deposits in foreign currencies from residents or nonresidents and to obtain short-term credits abroad. The banks may use their foreign exchange holdings for all authorized purposes, but the Ministry of Finance may set limits on their foreign exchange resources and in certain circumstances may require that foreign exchange assets be sold to the Bank of Portugal; since December 31,1971, the net foreign asset positions of the authorized banks have been subject to ceilings and since May 31, 1972 their gross foreign exchange holdings have been subject to ceilings. Capital held abroad by residents in the form of foreign exchange that is not subject to surrender requirements may be transferred to other residents through authorized commer- cial banks at official rates of exchange. Decree-Law No. 44699 of 1963 forbids direct transactions in foreign exchange between residents who are private persons. 1 The currencies dealt with in the official exchange market and quoted by the Bank of Portugal are Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, South African rand, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. 2 Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Hungary, and Israel. Settlements with Greece and Turkey are also channeled through special accounts. There is no forward exchange market, but authorized banks may enter into forward transactions with individual customers; the exchange rates may not be higher than the spot buying rate or lower than the spot selling rate of the same date, but the size of the commission is not prescribed. The commercial banks may cover open positions by entering in to swap transactions with the Bank of Portugal. The escudos issued in the overseas territories are at par with the metropolitan escudo. The parity for the Macao pa- taca is Esc 5.015 = pataca 1. Interterritorial payments are subject to transfer charges collected by the credit institutions concerned which may not exceed 0.6 per cent; this limit is 0.3 per cent for payments resulting from transactions in foreign currencies and settled through another overseas territory or through metropolitan Portugal. Interterritorial payments are also subject to a service charge. In addition, interterritorial payments which require the direct intervention of the Bank of Portugal as agent of either the interterritorial clearing sys- tem or the interterritorial payments system are subject to a service charge of 0.15 per cent payable to the Bank of Portu- gal. Exchange Control Territory Portugal and the Portuguese overseas territories (Angola, Cape Verde Islands, Macao, Mozambique, Portuguese Guinea, Sao Tome e Principe Islands, and Timor) constitute a single exchange control territory, the Portuguese Monetary Area or Escudo Area. W i th in the Escudo Area, interter- ritorial payments are subject to exchange control (except in Macao); they may be made directly through commercial banks or channeled through special accounts maintained by the Bank of Portugal (which is reserve bank of the Escudo Area, agent of the clearing system, and agent of the Monetary Fund of the Area) and the Exchange Funds of the individual overseas territories (either under the interterritorial payments system or the interterritorial clearing system). Decree-Law No. 41,403 of November 1957 and Decree-Law No. 44,016 of November 1961 provide that the foreign exchange regula- tions of metropolitan Portugal shall be applied in the overseas territories, subject to any local adjustments that may be nec- essary. Current payments from metropolitan Portugal to the overseas territories are in principle unrestricted, as are current payments to metropolitan Portugal from most of the overseas territories. In Angola and Mozambique, however, transac- tions involving payments to metropolitan Portugal as well as to foreign countries are subject at present to a system of priorities. Administration of Control Exchange controls are administered by the Bank of Portu- gal on behalf of the Ministry of Finance, with the assistance of the commercial banks authorized for this purpose. Trade control policy is formulated by the Commission of Economic Coordination in the Ministry of Economy. A Di- rectorate-General of Commerce in the Ministry of Economy administers the trade controls; import and export licenses 359 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PORTUGAL ("bulletins") are issued by the Foreign Trade Division, oper- ating within the office of the Directorate-General, or by other executive departments duly authorized. Licenses for imports of certain goods included in the negative list are issued by the economic coordination departments within the Ministry of Economy. Practically all foreign trade transactions are sub- ject to registration with the Ministry of Economy. Prescription of Currency Transactions with countries with which Portugal does not have bilateral payments agreements may be settled in any of the currencies quoted by the Bank of Portugal (see footnote 1), or, for Portuguese exports, in escudos to the debit of a Demand Foreign Account in Escudos (see section on Nonres- ident Accounts, below). Transactions with countries w i th which Portugal has bilateral payments agreements (see foot- note 2) are settled through clearing accounts maintained in U.S. dollars (for Greece, Israel, and Turkey), or in escudos or the currency of the partner country (for Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, and Hungary). In exceptional cases, pay- ments to nonresidents may be made by crediting escudos to a nonresident account, subject to prior approval by the Bank of Portugal. Payments between the overseas territories and foreign countries may be made either direct through the au- thorized banks of the territories concerned, or by means of the interterritorial clearing system, through metropolitan Portu- gal or another overseas territory. W i th in the Escudo Area, payments to metropolitan Portugal must be made in metro- politan escudos, while payments to the overseas territories may be made either in metropolitan escudos or in the cur- rency of the creditor country. Nonresident Accounts The main categories of nonresident accounts are described below. "Foreign Accounts in Escudos" in the name of persons resident or domiciled in countries with which Portugal does not have bilateral payments agreements or arrangements: These accounts are divided into (1) "Time Foreign Accounts in Escudos," for which the opening, debiting, and crediting are subject to special advance authorization of the Bank of Portugal, and (2) "Demand Foreign Accounts in Escudos," which may be opened, debited, and credited w i thout prior authorization of the Bank of Portugal for (a) payments for transactions expressed in escudos and duly authorized in that currency, for imports and exports of goods, services, and capital between metropolitan Portugal and foreign countries, 3 (b) purchases or sales of escudos against the for- eign currencies quoted by the Bank of Portugal, 4 (c) pur- chases or sales of foreign currencies quoted by the Bank of Portugal against escudos, and (d) transfers between these accounts. For all other debit and credit operations, authoriza- tion of the Bank of Portugal is required. 3 However, the in tent of the monetary directives in force is to exclude the escudo from payments to nonresidents, and the Bank of Portugal authorizes such payments in escudos on ly in exceptional cases. 4 Sales of escudos are subject to the proviso that the commercial bank concerned may be required to inform the Bank of Portugal of the na tu re of the transaction for which escudos are required. 360 The granting of credit in the form of overdrafts on the above accounts requires the authorization of the Bank of Portugal and for amounts exceeding Esc 50 million with a ma tu r i ty exceeding one year the approval of the Ministry of Finance is also required. "Foreign Accounts in Escudos" in the name of persons resident or domiciled in countries with which Portugal has bilateral payments agreements or arrangements: These ac- counts are opened, debited, and credited according to instruc- tions issued by the Bank of Portugal. There are also provisions for resident and nonresident ac- counts in foreign currencies, but these accounts are of limited importance. Imports and Import Payments Imports of certain products are prohibited, mainly for rea- sons of health, public order, and the prevention of commer- cial fraud. Any physical or juridical entity may be an importer; importers must be certified by the Corporation of Commerce and must pay income taxes regularly. Most imports consigned from and originating in the Portu- guese overseas territories are free of restriction. A registration procedure is applied, however, for payment control purposes, and certificates of origin are required to ensure that goods originating in foreign countries do not enter Portugal via overseas territories. Certain products, such as cotton and some oilseed products, may be imported freely from the Por- tuguese overseas territories after local industrial demand has been satisfied, but are subject to quantitative restrictions when imported from third countries. Special regulations are applied to sugar; imports from foreign countries take place only if supplies from overseas territories are insufficient. Almost all imports from outside the Portuguese Monetary Area are effected on the basis of "bulletins." For imports free of quan t i ta t ive restriction, the bulletin serves a statistical pur- pose and enables the importer to obtain the necessary foreign exchange as specified in the bulletin. For imports subject to restriction, the bulletin is equivalent to an import license. The validity of the bulletin is normally 180 days, but extensions are often granted. Baggage and imports of merchandise whose value does not exceed Esc 25,000 do not require a bulletin, provided they are not expressly excluded from this exemption. Payments for imports already cleared through customs require the approval of the Bank of Portugal when made after the validity of the bulletin. Payments beyond one year af ter customs clearance always require the approval of the Bank of Portugal. GoodB-not on the so-called negative list may be imported freely from most countries that are members of the GATT. The negative list includes certain foodstuffs, other agricultural products, certain natural or manufactured raw materials, some textile fibers, and a small number of finished products, including motor vehicles; the items on the negative list are subject to quantitative restrictions for protec- tive reasons or under special regimes. A somewhat more ex- tensive negative list applies to Japan. The GATT liberalization does not apply to Ghana, India, and Nigeria; imports from these GATT members of goods liberalized if imported from other GATT countries are subject to individ- ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ual authorization, which is granted on the merits of the case. Nonliberalized imports from countries that are GATT mem- bers are admitted either under global or bilateral quotas or under individual authorization. All imports from countries that are not members of the GATT are based on individual authorizations; imports from Eastern European countries are generally licensed restrictively or in accordance w i th bilateral agreements. There are bilateral quotas for specified agricultural imports from certain EFTA countries. Imports of nonliberalized in- dustrial products, except for certain protected steel products and automobiles, are free of quan t i ta t ive restriction when originating in EFTA or EEC countries. Special legislation provides that automobiles must be assembled in Portugal. Imports of passenger automobiles of EFTA origin are al- lowed up to 150 units a year for each producer, while those of non-EFTA origin are allowed up to 15 un i ts a producer a year for those makes not assembled in Portugal and, for other makes, up to 2 per cent of the number of passenger automo- biles of the same make that were assembled in Portugal in the preceding year. Imports of commercial vehicles for special purposes are free of restrictions. Imports of completely knocked-down vehicles from EFTA and EEC countries are free of restrictions, and allocations for imports from other GATT countries are available under special open licenses, subject to the use of certain m in imum percentages of domes- tic components. Payments for Invisibles Payments to the Portuguese overseas territories for current invisibles may be made freely through authorized banks. Such payments to foreign countries are also generally free of quan- titative restrictions, but for most transactions ceilings are specified for amounts of foreign exchange that authorized banks may grant freely. For payments to countries with which Portugal does not have bilateral payments agreements, the authorized banks may grant any amount of foreign exchange for expenditures incidental to trade; up to the equivalent of Esc 50,000 a person a year for tourism; 5 and up to the equivalent of Esc 100,000 for most transactions in invisibles not mentioned above, including income on imported capital. For payments to countries with which Portugal has bilateral payments agreements, the authorized banks may effect freely payments for invisibles listed in the respective payments agreements. Application must be made to the Bank of Portugal for ex- change for payments of items not referred to above and for payments in excess of the above-mentioned limits. Travelers may take out freely domestic and foreign bank- notes and foreign coins for their travel expenses; exports of notes and coins for other purposes require authorization from the Bank of Portugal. 5 Upon verification of the genuineness of the transaction, the Bank of Portugal authorizes additional exchange for persons wishing to travel abroad who have already used up their annual allocation. PORTUGAL Exports and Export Proceeds Exports and re-exports are effected on the basis of "bulle- tins" (similar to the import bulletins). Export bulletins for exports to Angola and Mozambique are issued only on evi- dence that the importer has already obtained an import bulle- t in. 6 For exports to other overseas provinces and to foreign countries, export bulletins are issued freely, with few excep- tions; the primary purpose of this procedure is to enforce the prescription of currency and surrender regulations. The ex- port of a few domestically produced goods is restricted, ma in ly to assure adequate supplies to domestic industries and to avoid depletion of local resources. Baggage and exports and re-exports of merchandise whose value does not exceed Esc 25,000 do not require a bulletin, provided they are not expressly excluded from this exemption. Exporters are required to sell to an authorized bank, within the period stipulated in the export bulletin, the total amount of the export proceeds, in the foreign currency indicated in the bulletin, if payment is not received from a Demand Foreign Account in Escudos. The Bank of Portugal may, however, authorize the deduction of commission expenses abroad, and freight, insurance, or other charges pertaining to exports, from the total amount of the export proceeds subject to sur- render. Proceeds from Invisibles Portuguese residents may receive freely payments up to Esc 500,000 for invisibles from residents of countries with which Portugal does not have bilateral payments agreements. Also, payments from residents of countries with which Portu- gal does have payments agreements may be received freely for invisibles listed in the payments agreements. Receipts on ac- count of all other invisibles require authorization by the Bank of Portugal, which is granted without restriction once the proposed operation proves to be real and licit. Receipts from invisibles must be surrendered. Travelers may bring in freely domestic and foreign bank- notes and coins for their travel expenses; imports of notes and coins for other purposes require authorization from the Bank of Portugal. Authorized banks are not permitted to receive or to pay domestic or foreign banknotes or coins for the settle- ment of external transactions. Capital With the exception of personal capital exports up to Esc 100,000 for each transfer from Portugal (inheritances, settlements, dowries, and gifts to relatives), capital transfers between Portugal and its overseas territories are subject to prior authorization by the Bank of Portugal; approval is also required from the authorities of the territory concerned. When the amount exceeds Esc 50 million, the approval of the Minister of Finance and of the Minister of Overseas Territo- 8 This provision was based on Decree No. 551 /71 of December 15, 1971, which was revoked by Decree-Law No. 187/74 of May 6, 1974. However, prior registration continued to be required for exports to Angola and Mozambique. As regards merchandise transactions w i th the other overseas territories, Article 7 of Decree-Law No. 44698 of November 17, 1962 remained in force. 361 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PORTUGAL ries 7 is required. For most types of transactions, however, authorization to export from Portugal (and to import into the overseas territory) is granted freely whenever the transaction is found to be a bona fide one. With the exception of the personal imports and exports of capital mentioned in the previous paragraph (up to Esc 500,000 for imports and up to Esc 100,000 for exports), all capital movements between Portugal and other countries require prior approval by the Bank of Portugal; for transac- tions in excess of Esc 50 million whose maturity exceeds one year, the approval of the Minister of Finance is also required. Foreign investments in Portugal by residents of countries that are members of or associated with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), EFTA, IMF, or the International Bank for Reconstruction and De- velopment (IBRD) are authorized freely if they involve activi- ties that are of recognized interest for Portugal's development and provided that no speculative operation in real estate is involved. Certain activities, however, are reserved for enter- prises having a majority of Portuguese capital; these include defense, public utilities, oil refining, and fishing. Further- more, Decree No. 393/70 specifies certain industries in which any domestic or foreign investment is subject to prior autho- rization. The transfer abroad of the full proceeds from the liquidation of foreign investment which originated in a bona fide inward capital movement from OECD, EFTA, IMF, or IBRD countries is authorized without restriction. Foreign credits from OECD countries with a ma tur i ty of up to five years are liberalized when a Portuguese resident participates in the underlying commercial or service transac- tion. The acceptance of other foreign credits is normally per- mitted. The repayment of foreign credits and loans that originated in a bona fide inward capital movement is always authorized. Investments outside the Portuguese Monetary Area by res- idents of Portugal are authorized only when the capital in- volved is not considered indispensable for the national economic development. In practice, authorization is granted only for small investments and for the improvement or en- largement of existing Portuguese investments. Residents of Portugal may reinvest in securities, within time limits fixed by the authorities, the proceeds of the sale of other securities in an OECD country. They may also trans- fer such proceeds to other residents, provided that the pro- ceeds do not belong to a Portuguese credit institution and that their owner is not under an obligation to surrender them to such an institution. Arbitrage operations in foreign securi- ties carried out by residents of Portugal involving two other OECD countries or between Portugal and an OECD country are authorized freely; but if a transfer of foreign exchange to or from Portugal is involved, a prior authorization is re- quired. Transfers by Portuguese nationals or by foreigners resident in Portugal who emigrate to any other OECD country are authorized automatically up to Esc 100,000 annually for a family and larger amounts may be granted on the merits of the case. Transfers by foreign nationals who have been resi- 7 W i th effect from May 15, 1974 the Minister for Interterritorial Coordina- tion. 362 dent in Portugal are authorized up to Esc 500,000 a year for a family when they return to their country of origin. Transfers on account of family loans, bequests, inheritances, and dow- ries to other OECD countries are usually authorized auto- matically up to Esc 500,000; for higher amounts, annual transfers up to Esc 500,000 are authorized. For bequests and inheritances, the legator or the deceased person must have been a resident of Portugal and the legatee or heir a resident of an OECD country at the time of death. Transfers to OECD countries in respect of life insurance policies due from Portuguese insurers are authorized in favor of the beneficiary when their value does not exceed Esc 500,000 for a capital sum, a reduced value, or an annuity certain, and Esc 50,000 for a surrender value. Capital movements and transfers of assets in excess of the limits mentioned, or not enumerated in the preceding para- graphs, or involving countries other than those mentioned above, are authorized on the merits of each case. The net foreign asset positions of authorized banks must not exceed 5 per cent of their current liabilities in domestic currency. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold in any form in Por- tugual, and there is a free gold market. The purchase or sale of coined or uncoined gold, when carried out between metro- politan Portugal and foreign countries, is subject to special advance authorization from the Bank of Portugal whenever a resident of metropolitan Portugal takes part in the transac- tion or has an interest in it. The import, export, or re-export of coined or uncoined gold is also subject to special advance authorization from the Bank of Portugal. Licensing of im- ports is relatively liberal but import authorizations for indus- trial gold are granted only to commercial banks and the Association of Industrial Users of Gold. Domestic sales of gold and of gold coins that are not legal tender are subject to a transaction tax of 20 per cent. There is a free market for gold in Macao, in which both residents of Macao and nonresidents who are not resident in the Portuguese Monetary Area may freely trade among them- selves in bars, leaves, and coins; settlement must take place in patacas or U.S. dollars. In Macao, the Government sets overall limits for imports of gold in any form other than jewelry; authority to carry out such imports is delegated to a concessionary enterprise for a two-year period. Imports and exports of gold, unless made by or on behalf of the Macao monetary authorities, require licenses issued by the Commis- sioner for Economy. Changes during 1973 January 1. The industrial free trade agreement signed with the EEC on July 22, 1972 came into effect. Quantitative restrictions on imports of certain products from EEC countries were eliminated. January 1. The regime for imports of passenger automo- biles from non-EFTA countries was modified.

Private individu- als were exempt up to Esc 500 a year. (In Mozambique the scope of exemptions from prior import registration had been similarly reduced on November 1, 1972.) February 14. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the central rate for the escudo was changed from Esc 27.25 = US$1 to Esc 25.50 = US$1. Portugal continued to avail itself of wider margins. March 19. Portugal ceased to ensure, for the time being, that the rates for the escudo would be kept within the margins previously observed in spot exchange transactions. As a re- sult, the escudo began to appreciate in terms of the U.S. dollar. March 26. The rate of exchange for the Macao pataca was changed from Esc 4.75 = pataca 1 to Esc 5.015 = pataca 1. April 10. The maximum amount of imports or exports which could be effected without a "bulletin" was raised from Esc 2,500 to Esc 25,000; the validity of import and export bulletins was extended from 90 to 180 days.

The Qatar Monetary Agency buys and sells sterling at no more than Exchange Rate System Nonresident Accounts ROMANIA No par value for the Romanian Leu has been established with the Fund. The leu is officially defined as equivalent to 0.148112 gram of f ine gold, yielding official rates as at De- cember 31, 1973 of lei 4.97 per U.S. dollar (lei 6 per SDR) and lei 6.67 per ruble. There is no exchange market. The National Bank of the Socialist Republic of Romania quotes official rates also for certain other currencies. Quotations for 14 of the 16 currencies defined as "freely convertible" l are based on their rates against the U.S. dollar in international centers; for other currencies, quotations are based on the gold definition for the leu and the par values or official rates of the currencies concerned. For exchange rate purposes, payments for insurance and transportation connected with trade are considered as trade transactions. Nontrade transactions with countries other than the socialist countries listed in footnote 2 are carried out at the official rate plus a premium of 189.33 per cent, resulting in a rate of lei 14.38 per US$1. Trade transactions are gener- ally subject to a price equalization system. The system is designed to eliminate the effect on the earnings of exporters and importers of the differences between domestic prices and foreign prices converted into lei at a uniform settlement coef- ficient. For nontrade transactions with some socialist countries 2 exchange rates are established by special agree- ments; for transactions with the U.S.S.R. this rate is lei 8.30 per ruble. Administration of Control Foreign trade is a state monopoly. Import and export transactions are effected by authorized industrial centrals, producing enterprises, and foreign trade enterprises, and are subject to import and export licenses granted by the Ministry of Foreign Trade. In the issuing of licenses, the provisions of the foreign trade plan and of existing trade agreements are taken into account. Foreign currency proceeds from exports are sold to the Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade; foreign currency required for import payments is purchased from that Bank. Exchange control is administered by the National Bank and the Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade. Prescription of Currency Payments to and from countries with which Romania has bilateral payments agreements are made in currencies and in accordance with the procedures set for th in those agree- ments. 3 If no agreement exists, settlement is usually made in a convertible currency. Permitted foreign payments may not be made in lei, and the import and export in any form of Romanian notes and coins are prohibited. 1 Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche ma rk, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Luxembourg francs, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. 2 Listed as: Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, D.R. of Germany, Hungary, P.R. of China, Mongolia, D.P.R. of Korea, D.R. of Viet-Nam, Poland, and U.S.S.R. 3 The countries with which bilateral payments arrangements were in force as of December 31, 1973 were listed as: Albania, Algeria, Bangladesh, Brazil, Foreign juridical and physical persons may maintain ac- counts with the Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade or with the National Bank. Neither justification nor authorization is required to open such accounts, except for foreign economic organizations and agencies, which have to show evidence of permission to operate in Romania. These accounts are of three kinds: A-Accounts are maintained in convertible cur- rency or in lei obtained for convertible currencies, gold, or other precious metals (except silver); B-Accounts are main- tained in nonconvertible currencies quoted by the National Bank or lei received from the conversion of such currencies. Transactions in any individual B-Account may be effected in only one such currency. C-Accounts are maintained in lei received from legal sources. A-Accounts may be debited for payments abroad in any currency, for payments within the country, and for transfers to any other A, B, or C-Account. B-Accounts may be debited for all payments abroad in the currencies from which the funds were derived and for payments within Romania. C-Accounts may be debited only for domestic transactions. The transactions permitted for the different accounts do not require any further authorization. No interest is paid on these accounts. 4 The deposits are considered as working balances. Nonresidents may also keep accounts with the Savings and Consignment Bank. Romanian citizens, including Romanians working abroad who transfer their savings to Romania, may open foreign currency accounts with the Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade or the National Bank. The deposits may be used for payments at home or abroad, or for exchange into lei at the official rate plus premium. In the case of certain foreign ex- change receipts from abroad, such as charitable donations or family maintenance, a proportion may be deposited in a for- eign currency account and the rest must be converted at the official rate plus premium. Imports and Exports Import and export plans are drawn up by the producing enterprises. On the basis of these plans, the foreign trade plan for the national economy as a whole specifies the main import and export products individually and establishes global quo- tas for other groups of products and for unspecified items. The foreign trade plan is not divided by countries but, accord- ing to the manner of settlement of exchange payments and People's Republic of China, Colombia, Cuba, Cyprus, Ecuador, Egyp t, Finland, Ghana, Greece, Guinea, India, Iran, D.P.R. of Korea, Lebanon, Libyan A rab Republic, Mali, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Syrian A rab Republic, Tunisia, D.R. of Viet-Nam, and Yugoslavia. Settlements w i th Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, D.R. of Germany, Hungary, Mongolia, Poland, and the U.S.S.R. took place th rough the multilateral payments system within the International Bank for Economic Cooperation. Furthermore, certain settle- ments w i th Singapore also took place through special accounts. The bilateral payments arrangement w i th the Libyan Arab Republic was terminated on February 14, 1974. 4 A decree of March 1, 1974 provided for interest of 2 per cent or 3 per cent to be payable on accounts in convertible currencies, depending on the kind of account and the amount and term of the deposit. Moreover, banks were authorized, at the request of customers, to accept foreign exchange deposits on which interest was paid at rates prevailing in international markets. 365 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ROMANIA receipts, it distinguishes between the clearing area and the convertible currency area. Within the context of the foreign trade plan, imports are subject to licenses which are given automatically as long as the requested foreign exchange is available. As a rule, annual import licenses expressed in value terms are issued to individ- ual importing enterprises as a lump sum, or for a single kind of product. The license stipulates whether import payments are to be made in convertible currency or under bilateral payments agreements, and in the latter case the country is also specified. Export proceeds must be sold to the Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade. However, there is an incentive system for enterprises which receive more foreign exchange than antici- pated. In such cases the exporting enterprises may either retain part of the surplus foreign exchange in excess of the quota due or convert the full amount of the actual foreign exchange receipts in to lei and receive a premium in lei. In the former case, the enterprise has the right either to utilize the surplus foreign exchange to make additional imports w i thout fu r ther approval, or to keep the amount concerned w i th the Bank in an interest-bearing account. Both the conversion and the reconversion are carried out at the official rate. The for- eign exchange surplus may be used only for imports. If the surplus foreign exchange earnings are in a convertible cur- rency, the exporting enterprise may convert the amount con- cerned in to any convertible currency. Invisibles All transactions in invisibles not connected w i th foreign trade transactions require general or individual authorization given either by the Ministry of Finance or the competent m in is try. For most categories of payments in respect of invisi- bles, foreign exchange is made available automatically once the transaction has been authorized. For travel outside social- ist countries an exchange allocation is provided up to the equivalent of US$70 a trip for each adult person for one tr ip a year. In addition, tourist agencies may organize group or individual trips payable in lei in amounts the equivalent of which may exceed the maximum allocations of foreign ex- change. Receipts from transactions in invisibles must be sold to the Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade, and the foreign currency required for payments in respect of such transac- tions is bought from the same bank. Receipts in foreign cur- rencies from travelers are converted at lei 14.38 per US$1. The import and export of Romanian notes and coins by travelers is prohibited. Capital All inward and outward transfers of foreign exchange must be authorized by the Ministry of Finance. Outward transfers of funds belonging to resident physical persons are not nor- mally permitted. For certain established categories, such as 366 inheritances, reciprocal agreements have been concluded with a number of countries providing for automatic authorization of transfers of specified amounts to and from Romania. A Foreign Trade Law (Law No. 1 of March 1971) provides for the possibility of the establishment of joint ventures in Romania and abroad by Romanian economic organizations; under this law and enabling Decrees Nos. 424 and 425 of 1972, foreigners are also allowed to invest capital in joint ventures in Romania, up to 49 per cent of the total capital of the company concerned. The law and the decrees guarantee the repatriation in foreign currency of the capital and the transfer in foreign currency of profits after taxes. By agree- ment the accounts of jo int ventures may be kept in an agreed currency. Foreign physical and juridical persons may keep in bank accounts in Romania their legally owned foreign currency or lei funds; balances in foreign exchange accounts are transfer- able abroad. Romanian nationals working abroad may hold their foreign currency savings in accounts opened with Ro- manian banks and use these funds for payments in Romania or abroad (see section on Nonresident Accounts, above). Gold Only the National Bank has authority to purchase or sell gold in any manner, at home or abroad. The Bank, in turn, authorizes certain juridical persons to hold gold, to use it, and to engage in gold transactions, in accordance with the law. The ownership by physical persons, for domestic and per- sonal use, of jewelry and of artistic and cultural objects of gold, is not restricted. Changes during 1973 January 1. Following the expiration on December 31, 1972 of the bilateral payments agreement w i th Spain, settlements with that country took place in convertible currencies. February 14. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Romania maintained the official rate of the leu unchanged in terms of gold. The official rate for the U.S. dollar, previously lei 5.53, became lei 4.97, and the rate applicable to nontrade settlements was changed from lei 16 to lei 14.38 per U.S. dollar. March 31. The bilateral payments agreement with Turkey expired. April 14. The bilateral payments agreement with Switzer- land expired. June 20. The National Assembly adopted legislation to introduce a customs tariff w i th effect from January 1, 1974. June 30. The bilateral payments agreement with Austria expired. July 1. For export and import products, a uniform settle- ment coefficient different from the official rate with premium was applied for the effective conversion of foreign exchange receipts into domestic currency. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution RWANDA Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.00888671 gram of fine gold per Rwanda Franc, corresponding to RF 100 = SDR 1, and Rwanda avails itself of wider margins. The National Bank of Rwan- da (the central bank) has established a "central rate" of RF 230 = BF 100 and quotes "indicative central rates" for certain other currencies. l On December 31, 1973, the buy- ing and selling rates for the Belgian franc were RF 230 and RF 235.18, respectively, per BF 100, and those for the U.S. dollar were RF 91.22 and RF 93.30, respectively, per US$1. The "indicative central rate" for the U.S. dollar on December 31, 1973 was RF 92.77 = US$1. Exchange pro- ceeds from coffee exports, however, were purchased at RF 85 = US$1 .2 The National Bank levies a fee (droit de dossier) for the validation of import and export licenses as well as transfer authorizations; the fee is RF 350 for import and export li- censes or 2 per cent of the amount approved for transfers other than import payments. Payments by the Government and public sector agencies are exempt. Administration of Control Control over foreign exchange transactions and foreign trade is vested in the National Bank; authority to carry out some of these transactions is delegated to authorized banks. Exchange policy and foreign trade policy are, in principle, to be determined by the General Foreign Exchange and Licens- ing Committee, which comprises the Minister of Finance, the Governor of the National Bank, and five other members. Prescription of Currency Certain settlements with Zaire are made through special accounts. Otherwise, the following applies. The U.S. dollar may be used for all payments and receipts, with the exception that payments to Burundi, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda must be made in the currency of the country concerned. The Belgian franc may be used for all transactions with Zaire and any European country. Payments from any country may be received in Belgian francs, deutsche mark, French francs, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars; in addition, proceeds from exports to Kenya, Tanza- nia, and Uganda may be received in the currency of the country concerned. All foreign payments, except in border trade, must be made by bank transfer. Exchange transactions with Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. Imports and Import Payments A few imports, such as narcotics, are prohibited from all sources for reasons of public policy. Imports from Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. All imports ex- 1 Burundi francs, Canadian dollars, deutsche mark, French francs, Kenya shillings, Netherlands guilders, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, Tanzania shillings, Uganda shillings, U.S. dollars, and zatres. 2 With effect from January 7, 1974 Rwanda established a central rate of RF 112 = SDR 1 and continued to avail itself of wider margins. The currency was repegged to the U.S. dollar, at a rate of RF 92.84 = US$1. cept baggage and household effects of travelers and merchan- dise valued up to RF 20,000 (when settled in Rwanda francs) require licenses if payment is to take place in foreign ex- change; these are issued freely and serve statistical purposes only. Before orders are placed, applications for import li- censes for all other goods must be submitted to the National Bank through an authorized bank on a form entitled Import License and Payments Authorization (Model I). The ap- proval of an import license application constitutes an authori- zation also to obtain foreign exchange. An open individual license (global license) permits the im- portation of certain petroleum products and butane gas by specified companies. The National Bank grants global import licenses for other commodities and for specified amounts to individual firms in order to ensure their continuous operation. Licenses are examined at the National Bank only to avoid capital exports through overinvoicing and to ensure that im- porters (unless exceptionally authorized to do so) do not have recourse to domestic bank credit. Except as stated above, there are no restrictions as to currency of payment or permit- ted origin or place of shipment, but control is exercised to ensure that payments are made to the supplier country. Im- port licenses must be presented to the customs officials when the goods are cleared through customs. The number and date of expiration must be entered on the customs clearance form, a copy of which is then sent to the National Bank by the customs authorities. In principle, payments for imports can- not be made prior to customs clearance and must be made within the validity period of the license; however, importers are authorized to pay for imports by means of documentary credits if their books are kept in accordance with the account- ing rules of the Common Organization of African, Malagasy and Mauritian States. All imports are subject to a license validation fee (droit de dossier), which is RF 350 a license for most goods and 1 per cent of the value c.i.f. Kigali of the license, with a maximum of RF 5,000, for specified luxury items. The same luxury items (Group B) are subject to an advance deposit require- ment of 50 per cent of the c.i.f. value, payable when the license application is submitted and released when the import pay- ment is made, i.e., normally upon customs clearance. All dutiable imports are subject to a statistical tax of 3 per cent ad valorem. 3 Payments for Invisibles The prior approval of the National Bank is required for all payments for invisibles. Foreign exchange is sold by the Na- tional Bank, through the authorized banks, for transport, insurance, and other expenses connected with imports and exports; for transfers of the salaries or wages—after income tax and after deduction of RF 25,000 a month —of foreign nationals employed in Rwanda under contract (normally lim- ited to RF 80,000 a month); for transfers of the net earned income of foreign nationals who are self-employed or are 3 In January 1974 the statistical tax was abolished and absorbed into the customs tariff. 367 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution RWANDA engaged in a profession or established as independent traders; and for salaries of foreigners traveling abroad on leave. Pay- ments in respect of transport charges on imports and exports cannot be made until imported goods have been cleared through customs or after the exchange proceeds from exports have been surrendered. Net profits and dividends due to non- residents may in principle be remitted abroad in fu l l, subject to the right of the National Bank to prescribe their transfer in installments. Nonresidents may transfer their net income from rents (after deduction of taxes and a provision of 20 per cent for maintenance), and residents of foreign nationality may remit two thirds of such net income; the National Bank, however, may limit the amounts so transferable, and nor- mally limits them to RF 80,000 a mon th. Residents may freely purchase tickets for travel abroad in Rwanda francs, w i th the exception that the prior approval of the National Bank may be required when certain travel by persons of foreign nationality is involved. Purchases of for- eign exchange for travel purposes are authorized on an ad hoc basis. Remittances for payments for certain other invisibles may also be authorized on an ad hoc basis. Travelers may take out domestic banknotes up to RF 5,000. Residents require authorization by the National Bank to take out foreign banknotes. Nonresident travelers may take out any amount in foreign banknotes. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are pro- hibited. All exports, except trade samples, baggage and household effects of travelers, and merchandise valued at less than RF 20,000, are subject to a prior declaration entitled Declaration of Collection of Foreign Exchange (Model E). Declarations for all exports must be presented to the National Bank through an authorized bank, for certification. A decla- ration is valid for a period of three months, but extensions may be granted by the National Bank, which also reserves the right to determine the conditions for certification. For ex- ports to Burundi, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zaire, pay- ment must be collected not later than 30 days after the goods have left the country; for exports to all other countries, this period is 120 days, except for minerals shipped abroad for refining, for which the period is 180 days. All exchange pro- ceeds from exports must be surrendered to an authorized bank within 8 days from their collection. Proceeds from Invisibles All receipts from invisibles must be surrendered to the authorized banks within 8 days from their collection. Travel- ers may bring in up to RF 5,000 in domestic banknotes and any amount in foreign banknotes. Capital All outward transfers of capital require the prior approval of the National Bank. Such approval is rarely given unless the transfer relates to a foreign investment in Rwanda that is covered by the Investment Law of May 4, 1964 or to the personal effects of a foreign national returning to his own country. Retransfer guarantees, as well as an exchange rate guarantee, may be given by the National Bank in respect of short-term capital inflows remaining in Rwanda for at least two months; such inflows result mainly from swap transac- tions between Rwandese banks and their foreign correspon- dents. Commercial banks are not permitted to import or export domestic banknotes. Gold Residents may purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in Rwanda for numismatic purposes only. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry. Imports and exports of gold require licenses and are normally made only by the monetary authori- ties. Changes during 1973 February 12. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, exchange transactions were sus- pended. Formally, Rwanda maintained the official buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar unchanged, at RF 92.11 buying and RF 94.18 selling. March 2. Communication Rt. I l l /N o. 31 provided that to qualify for the status of importer applicants must deposit in cash with the National Bank a security deposit (caution), the amount of which was to be determined at a later date. March 23. The Rwanda franc was repegged from the U.S. dollar to the Belgian franc. A "central rate" of RF 230 = BF 100 was established. The National Bank henceforth pub- lished "indicative central rates*' for about 12 other currencies, including the U.S. dollar, which were based on rates in the Belgian official exchange market. A rate of RF 85 = US$1 was established for exchange proceeds from coffee exports. The initial "indicative central rate" for the U.S. dollar was RF 92.77 = US$1. April 12. The payments agreement signed on October 19, 1972 by the National Bank of Rwanda and the Bank of Zaire came into operation. May 1. Transfers by foreign nationals of rents and of sav- ings from salaries henceforth were generally limited to RF 80,00 a person a mon th. 368 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SAUDI ARABIA Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.207510 gram of f ine gold per Saudi Arabian Riyal or SRls 4.28255 = SDR 1, corresponding to SRls 3.55001 = US$1, and Saudi Arabia avails itself of wider margins. The Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency has an- nounced a do l lar /r iyal parity of SRls 3.55 per U.S. dollar; it sells U.S. dollars to banks at SRls 3.555 per US$1 and buys from banks and the principal producer of petroleum at SRls 3.545 per US$1; these rates serve as the basis for ex- change quotations in the market, the banks being permitted to charge up to SENEGAL Exchange System No par value for the currency of Senegal has been es- tablished with the Fund. The unit of its currency is the CFA Franc ,l which is officially maintained at the rate of CFAF 1 = 0.02 French franc. Exchange transactions in French francs, the intervention currency, between the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de 1'Ouest (BCEAO) and commercial banks take place at the rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02, free of commission. Exchange transactions relating to foreign countries, i.e., countries other than France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories except the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries of the French Franc Area, take place in a dual exchange market at rates based on the fixed rate for the French franc and the Paris exchange rate for the foreign currency concerned in either the official exchange market or the financial franc mar- ket. Settlements eligible for the official exchange market are payments and receipts in respect of imports, exports, and most other current transactions, as well as current payments by or in favor of domestic and foreign public authorities and public bodies. All other settlements with foreign countries, as well as transactions in banknotes of foreign countries and banknotes issued by the BCEAO, take place through the financial franc market at freely f luc tua t ing rates. The princi- pal current payments and receipts channeled through the financial franc market are those relating to travel expenses, capital earnings, and workers' remittances. Exchange rates for certain European currencies in the official market are based on par values and central rates; the effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar in this market is not confined within any announced margins. With the exception of those relating to gold, Senegal's exchange control measures do not apply to (1) France (as defined above) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Opera- tions Account (Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the People's Republic of the Congo, Dahomey, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Togo, and Upper Volta). 2 Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries, except Senegal itself, are considered foreign countries, and in principle financial relations only with for- eign countries are subject to exchange control. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Directorate of Money and Credit in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs, which also supervises borrowing and lending abroad, the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securi- ties in Senegal, inward direct investment, and all outward investments. Part of the approval authority in respect of ex- change control has been delegated to authorized banks. The 1 The CFA franc is issued by the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de POuest (BCEAO) and is the common currency in Dahomey, Ivory Coast, Niger, Senegal, Togo, and Upper Volta. ^Senegal's regulations did not formally exclude Mauritania from this group of countries until January 19, 1974. 370 BCEAO is authorized to collect, either directly or through the intermediary of banks, other financial institutions, the Postal Administration, and notaries public, any information necessary to compile the balance of payments statistics. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through authorized banks or the Postal Administra- tion. Import and export licenses are issued by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs (Directorate of Foreign Trade), including those for gold. Import certificates for liber- alized commodities are made out by the importer himself. Prescription of Currency Senegal is an Operations Account country of the French Franc Area, since the BCEAO maintains an Operations Ac- count with the French Treasury; settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the other Operations Account countries of the French Franc Area are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other Operations Ac- count country. Certain settlements with Guinea are made through bilateral accounts established under a payments agreement. 3 Settlements with all other countries are usually made through correspondent banks in France in any of the currencies of those countries or in French francs through Foreign or Financial Accounts in Francs. All settlements with Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. The crediting to nonresi- dent accounts of CFA banknotes, French banknotes, or banknotes issued by any other institute of issue that main- tains an Operations Account with the French Treasury is not permitted, except for BCEAO banknotes mailed direct to the BCEAO agency in Dakar by authorized banks' foreign corre- spondents; such banknotes may be credited to Financial Ac- counts opened by the latter with authorized banks in Senegal. Imports and Import Payments Imports of Portuguese, Rhodesian, and South African ori- gin and /or provenance are prohibited from any source, and the import of certain other goods is prohibited from all countries except member states of the West African Customs Union. The import from any source of a number of other commodities is subject to individual licensing. Imports from countries in the French Franc Area other than Mali are gener- ally free of license and quantitative restriction; some goods, although free from import license, require prior authorization by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs. Imports of virtually all goods from EEC countries and imports of some goods from former OEEC countries, the United States, and Canada are free of quantitative restrictions; such liberalized imports require only an import certificate made out by the importer himself. There is an annual program with global 3 There is an inoperative payments agreement with Mali. The agreement account was closed on September 30, 1970. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution quotas for imports from all non-EEC countries outside the French Franc Area. The import program is put in to effect through individual licenses, which are required for most com- modities. Licenses are issued only to authorized traders and to industrial and agricultural producers. All import transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value ex- ceeds CFAF 25,000 (c.i.f. or delivered at the border). The import licenses or import certificates entitle importers to pur- chase the necessary exchange, but not earlier than eight days before shipment if a documentary credit is opened or eight days before the payment is due if the commodities have al- ready been imported (if no documentary credit has been opened, on presentation of the bill of lading). Furthermore, payments for imports valued at CFAF 500,000 or less (but over CFAF 15,000) cannot be made prior to customs clear- ance. Payments for Invisibles All payments to Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to approval. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authoriza- tion. Furthermore, authorized banks have been empowered to effect freely any payment abroad up to CFAF 15,000 on behalf of residents. Transfers of income accruing to nonresi- dents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted. For tourist travel, residents traveling to countries other than France, Monaco, and the other Operations Ac- count countries of the French Franc Area may obtain an exchange allocation of an amount equivalent to CFAF 150,000 a year for each person (CFAF 75,000 for children under ten); any foreign exchange remaining after return to Senegal must be surrendered. Applications for additional amounts of foreign exchange may also be approved. For busi- ness travel, there is a special allocation of the equivalent of CFAF 7,500 a day, subject to a maximum of CFAF 150,000 a person a trip, but not more than the equivalent of CFAF 15,000 may be taken out in foreign notes. The transfer of the full net salary of a foreigner working in Senegal is permitted upon presentation of the appropriate pay voucher, provided that the transfer takes place within three months of the pay period. Resident and nonresident travelers going to foreign countries may take out, in addition to any foreign exchange allocation, up to CFAF 15,000 in BCEAO banknotes, French banknotes, and banknotes issued by other Operations Ac- count countries. Resident travelers to other countries of the French Franc Area may take out any amount in BCEAO banknotes, but if the country of destination is not a member country of the West African Monetary Union, they must declare the amount taken out to the customs if it exceeds CFAF 150,000. SENEGAL Nonresident travelers may take out foreign banknotes and coins up to the amount declared by them on entry (minus the amount converted in Senegal plus any amount up to CFAF 50,000 reconverted by purchase of foreign banknotes), or if no declaration has been made, up to the equivalent of CFAF 50,000; other banknotes as stated above; and any means of payment established abroad in their name, such as travelers checks. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Portugual, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. With a few exceptions (e.g., gold, diamonds, tunny), exports to countries in the French Franc Area are free of license. Most exports to other countries require licenses, mainly in order to assure adequate supplies for the domestic needs of Senegal and to prevent certain re-exports. Export proceeds received in currencies other than those of France or another Operations Account country must in principle be collected within 120 days of the arrival of the goods at their destination and surrendered not later than two months after collection. All export transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value exceeds CFAF 50,000. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France (as defined above), Monaco, and other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services, and all income earned in those countries from for- eign assets must be collected, and surrendered, if received in foreign currency, w i th in two months of the due date or the date of receipt. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of banknotes and coins issued by the BCEAO, the Bank of France, or any bank of issue maintaining an Operations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign banknotes and coins (except gold coins) of countries outside the French Franc Area; residents bringing in foreign banknotes must declare them to the customs upon entry and sell them to an authorized bank within eight days. Capital All settlements between Senegal and Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. Capital movements between Senegal and France (as defined above), Monaco, and other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require exchange control approval but capital re- ceipts from such countries are permitted freely. Special controls (additional to any exchange control re- quirements that may be applicable) are maintained over bor- rowing abroad, over inward direct investment and all outward investment, and over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Senegal; these controls relate to the transactions themselves, not to payments or receipts. With the exception of those over foreign securities, these control measures do not apply to relations with France 371 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SENEGAL (as defined above), Monaco, the other member countries of the West African Monetary Union, and those other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account. Special controls are maintained also over imports and exports of gold, over the soliciting of funds for deposit w i th foreign private persons and foreign firms and ins t i tu t ions, and over all publicity aimed at placing funds abroad or at subscribing to real estate building operations abroad; these special controls do apply also to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries. All investment abroad by residents of Senegal requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs. 4 Foreign direct investments in Senegal 5 must be declared to the Minister of Finance before such investments are made. The Minister has a period of two months from receipt of the declaration dur ing which he may request the postponement of the projects submitted to him. Both the making and the liquidating of direct and other investments, whether these are Senegalese investments abroad or foreign investments in Senegal, must be reported to the Minister of Finance and Economic Affa irs and the BCEAO w i th in 20 days following each operation. Direct investments are defined as investments imp ly ing control of a company or enterprise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 per cent in the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign secu- rities in Senegal requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs. Exempt from authoriza- tion, however, are operations in connection with (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Senegalese Government and (2) shares that are similar to or may be substituted for securi- ties whose issue, offering, or sale in Senegal has previously been authorized. Borrowing by residents from nonresidents requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance and Economic Af- fairs. The following are, however, exempt from this authoriza- tion: (1) loans cons t i tu t ing a direct investment, which are subject to prior declaration, as indicated above; (2) loans contracted by authorized banks; (3) loans other than those mentioned above, subject to certain conditions, when the total amount outstanding of these loans, including the new borrowing, does not exceed CFAF 40 million for any one borrower. The repayment of loans not constituting a direct investment requires the special authorization of the Minister if the loan itself was subject to such approval, but is exempt if the loan was exempt from special authorization. Lending abroad requires prior authorization by the Minis- try of Finance and Economic Affairs. The Investment Code of June 12, 1972 (Law No. 72-43), provides various facilities and benefits for approved foreign investments in Senegal. 4 Inc lud ing investments made th rough the intermediary of foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in Senegal and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Senegal. 5 Inc lud ing those made by companies in Senegal that are directly or ind irec t ly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in Senegal of foreign companies. 372 Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Senegal. Imports and exports of gold from or to any other country require prior authorization by the Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs. Exempt from this require- ment are (1) imports and exports by the Treasury or the BCEAO; (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quantity of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles); and (3) imports and exports by travelers of gold articles up to a combined weight of 200 grams. By virtue of Ordinance No. 60-21 of October 1, 1960, brokers in precious metals require an authorization from the Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs to conduct their business. Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Purchases abroad of nonmonetary gold are subject to a tax of 25 per cent. Commercial imports of gold jewelry require prior authorization (Decree No. 65-794 of November 19, 1965). Furthermore, imports of ornaments require the prior advice of the Senegal Office for Handicrafts (Office Senegalais de FArtisanat) and the Directorate of Mines and Geology (Notice to Importers of May 17, 1971). Changes during 1973 January 29. The commissions levied by the BCEAO on transfers to France and other countries of the French Franc Area (except those of the West African Monetary Union) were made identical with those on transfers to countries out- side the French Franc Area. The unified commissions were increased on July 2. February 13. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the exchange rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02 was maintained; the effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously CFAF 255.785 = US$1, became CFAF 230.207 = US$1. March 19. With the entry into effect of new margins ar- rangements between the French franc and certain other Euro- pean currencies, and the maintenance of the exchange rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02, the CFA franc began to appreciate in terms of the U.S. dollar. April 9. Circular No. 87 reduced the amount up to which exports to foreign countries were exempt from domiciliation from CFAF 500,000 to CFAF 50,000, and the corresponding amount for imports from CFAF 500,000 to CFAF 25,000. July 1. Mauritania ceased to be a member of the BCEAO. July 2. The commissions levied by banks on transfers to countries outside the West African Monetary Union were increased. Part of the "proportional commission" had to be passed on to the Treasury. August 1. The exchange control regulations applicable to foreign countries were formally applied also to the Malagasy Republic by virtue of Circular No. 959. (They were formally applied to Mauritania, subject to certain special provisions, by Circular No. 15 of January 19, 1974). September 15. Decree No. 73-808 of August 28, 1973 was published. It reorganized the Ministry of Finance and Eco- nomic Affairs and placed the Directorate of Money and Credit in charge of exchange control. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SIERRA LEONE Exchange Rate System The par value is 1.06641 grams of f ine gold per Leone, corresponding to Le 0.833333 = SDR 1. The Bank of Sierra Leone stands ready in transactions with commercial banks to buy and sell leones in exchange for sterling at the rate of Le 1 = £ stg. 0.50, subject to maximum commission of 1 per cent on either side. The authorized banks in Sierra Leone base their rates for other currencies on the current London market rates. On December 31, 1973, the banks' buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were US$1.17 and US$1.15, respec- tively, per Le 1. Sierra Leone avails itself of wider margins. Administration of Control Exchange control policy is made by the Ministry of Fi- nance. The day-to-day administration of exchange control is carried out by the Bank of Sierra Leone. Authorized commer- cial banks are permitted to sell exchange for permitted im- ports and, in small amounts, for travel expenses. The Bank of Sierra Leone has power to direct payments into Blocked Accounts. Import and export licenses are issued by the Minis- try of Trade and Industry. Prescription of Currency Sierra Leone has ceased to be a Scheduled Territory in terms of the U.K. Exchange Control Act, 1947 but under current U.K. exchange control regulations continues to be regarded as a country of the Overseas Sterling Area. Transac- tions with Sterling Area countries as well as non-Sterling Area countries are subject to exchange control. Sierra Le- one's regulations define the Sterling Area so as to include Sierra Leone and to exclude South Africa. Settlements with other Sterling Area countries usually are made in sterling or other Sterling Area currencies. Certain settlements with the People's Republic of China must be channeled through clear- ing accounts established under the terms of a bilateral pay- ments agreement. * Authorized payments to countries outside the Sterling Area other than the People's Republic of China and Rhodesia, including payments for imports, may be made in leones to the credit of an External Account in Sierra Leone, in sterling to the credit of an External Account in the United Kingdom, or in any other foreign currency 2 except Rhodesian currency. Receipts from exports to non-Sterling Area countries other than the People's Republic of China and Rhodesia may be obtained in sterling from an External Ac- count in the United Kingdom, in leones from an External Account in Sierra Leone, or in any specified currency other than a currency of the Sterling Area. 3 Receipts from exports to Sterling Area countries may be obtained in leones from a Sterling Area Account or in any currency of the Sterling Area 1 A payments agreement concluded with Guinea in 1964 is inoperative. 2 Foreign currencies are all currencies other than the leone. 3 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, dcutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, Spanish pesetas, pounds sterling, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. other than leones. Settlements with Rhodesia and South Af- rica are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts Accounts in leones held with authorized banks in Sierra Leone by residents of countries outside Sierra Leone other than residents of Rhodesia may be designated External Ac- counts. Residents of Sterling Area countries may maintain Sterling Area Accounts denominated in leones. Rhodesian Accounts are accounts with banks in Sierra Leone conducted in the name of persons resident in Rhodesia. In addition, there are Blocked Accounts, to which are credited amounts that may not be remitted abroad and that are due to nonresi- dents. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. All imports from the People's Republic of China, countries in the Soviet area other than Czechoslovakia and the U.S.S.R., and Algeria, Egypt, and the Republic of Korea, and certain commodities 4 from any source require individual import licenses. The National Trading Company Ltd. has a monopoly over the import of specified foodstuffs, including sugar, tea, and coffee. With the exception of specified tex- tiles, 5 all other imports from Czechoslovakia, the U.S.S.R., and most countries and territories outside the People's Re- public of China and the Soviet area may be made freely under open general license. 6 Foreign exchange is granted for all permitted impo r ts .7 Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to nonresidents require approval, which for most current transactions is given freely. 4 The "negative" list includes bacteriological products and other antibiotics, opium and cocaine derivatives and preparations, medicines and pharmaceutical products, firearms, ammunition, explosives, unworked and partly worked silver, gold jewelry, meat, rice, seeds, flower bulbs, wheat flour, maslin flour, corn, certain other foodstuffs, raw tobacco, certain textiles and textile articles, fiber suitcases, umbrellas, plastic footwear, cement, commodities of the type exported by the Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board (e.g., palm kernel and palm oil), live cattle, salt, certain oil refinery products, all sizes of complete passenger automobiles, certain other motor vehicles, and certain parts of motor vehicles. 5 These specified textiles may be imported under open general license from all countries other than People's Republic of China, Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Japan, North Korea, Republic of Korea, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Singapore, and Sri Lanka. Imports from the sources mentioned are restricted. 6 The open general license applies to Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bahamas, Barbados, Belgium, Bermuda, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Cameroon, Canada, Central African Republic, Chad, Chile, Colombia, People's Republic of the Congo, Costa Rica, Cuba, Cyprus, Czechoslovakia, Dahomey, Den- mark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Finland, France, Gabon, The Gambia, Federal Republic of Germany, Ghana, Greece, Guatemala, Guinea, Haiti, Honduras, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Ivory Coast, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Khmer Republic, Kuwa i t, Leeward Islands, Liberia, Libyan Arab Republic, Luxembourg, Malagasy Republic, Malawi, Malaysia, Mali, Malta, Mauritania, Mexico, Morocco, Muscat, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Senegal, Singapore, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Tanzania, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Uganda, U.S.S.R., United Kingdom, United States, Upper Volta, Uruguay, Venezuela, Windward Islands, Yugoslavia, Zaire, and Zambia. 7 With effect from January 1, 1974, foreign exchange ceased to be made available for insurance on imported goods. 373 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SIERRA LEONE For travel abroad, residents are entitled to a basic exchange allowance of Le 500 a calendar year. Applications for larger amounts are considered on an individual basis. In addition to the basic exchange allowance travelers may take out, regard- less of destination, Le 20 in leone notes and the equivalent of Le 50 in foreign currency notes. Nonresident travelers may take out foreign currency banknotes, including sterling notes, declared by them when entering Sierra Leone. Exports and Export Proceeds Except for a few commodities sold to certain destinations, exports require individual export licenses. Exports to Portu- gal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. The proceeds in specified currencies (see footnote 3) of exports other than diamonds to countries outside the Sterling Area must be sold to an authorized bank in Sierra Leone within six months from the date of export, unless permission to do otherwise is ob- tained. The proceeds from exports of diamonds must be ob- tained in a specified currency or in a currency that is freely convertible into leones by the country of the purchaser, and must be sold to authorized banks in Sierra Leone. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in specified currencies (see foot- note 3) must be offered for sale to an authorized bank. Subject to declaration upon entry, persons entering Sierra Leone may bring in any amount of domestic and foreign banknotes other than Guinean banknotes, the importation of which is prohib- ited. Banks do not, however, accept any foreign banknotes whose importation into the country of issue is prohibited. Capital Capital payments to nonresidents of Sierra Leone are sub- ject to exchange control. Residents of Sierra Leone require permission from the Bank of Sierra Leone to purchase foreign currency securities or real estate situated outside Sierra Le- one. Investments by nonresidents other than residents of Rhodesia may be repatriated at any time, together with prof- its, provided that exchange control permission was obtained initially for the investment. The Sierra Leone Exchange Control Act of 1954 imposes control on the issue and transfer of securities. The placing of an issue in Sierra Leone requires permission if either the person acquiring the securities or the person for whom he is nominee is resident outside Sierra Leone. Permission must also be obtained before a security registered in Sierra Leone may be transferred to a person resident outside Sierra Leone. Capital in respect of securities registered in Sierra Leone may not be transferred outside Sierra Leone without permission. Where pemiission has been given for securities registered in Sierra Leone to be sold to persons resident outside Sierra Leone, the company is usually required to obtain bank certifi- cation of the funds brought into Sierra Leone to ensure that 374 permission will not be given later for taking out appreciably more than was brought in. The Development Ordinance of 1960 provides for income tax and customs duty concessions to foreign and domestic companies undertaking industrial or agricultural activities that are needed for the development of the country. Noncitizens are prohibited from owning or con- trolling certain types of business. By virtue of Public Notice No. 71 of December 4, 1972 residents of Sierra Leone (including foreign nationals tempo- rarily resident in Sierra Leone) are permitted to hold in the Sterling Area certain sterling assets held by them prior to June 24, 1972 (viz., cash balances and deposits with banks, post offices, building societies, or trustee savings banks, and any other similar investments or securities, as well as any security issued by a registrar in the Sterling Area). Exempted securities may be sold outside the Sterling Area and any income therefrom may be retained in the Sterling Area or reinvested in other Sterling Area securities. Any certificate of security purchased with the proceeds of sale of securities exempted under this permission is exempt from deposit re- quirements. Any assets held outside the Sterling Area by any foreign national temporarily resident in Sierra Leone also are exempt from surrender and deposit requirements. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in Sierra Leone for numismatic purposes. Also, residents and nonresidents may freely purchase, hold, sell, or export certain Sierra Leonean gold coins issued for commemorative pur- poses. With these exceptions, residents other than the mone- tary authorities, gold producers, and authorized industrial users are not allowed to purchase, hold, or sell gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Imports of gold in any form other than jewelry constituting the personal ef- fects of a traveler require individual import licenses. Exports of gold in any form require licenses issued by the Chief In- spector of Mines; such licenses are not normally granted except for exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and local gold producers. Travelers, however, do not require a license to take out personal jewelry if the value of the total gold and platinum content does not exceed Le 200. Exports of unworked gold are not subject to export tax. Changes during 1973 February 17. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the fixed relationship between the leone and the pound sterling was maintained at Le 1 = £ stg. 0.50 and the leone continued to float with sterling. September 7. Sierra Leone disinvoked Article XXXV of the GATT in respect of Japan. September 27. Government Notice No. 940 was published containing General Import Licence (No. 1 of 1974). The license was applicable also to Guinea. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Exchange Rate System Nonresident Accounts SINGAPORE The par value is 0.290299 gram of fine gold per Singapore Dollar, corresponding to S$3.06122 = SDR 1, and Singapore avails itself of wider margins. Since June 20, 1973, however, the authorities have not maintained the exchange rate within announced margins, and therefore all transactions other than those in Brunei currency take place at a fluctuating exchange rate. The closing selling and buying rates in the Singapore foreign exchange market for the U.S. dollar on December 31, 1973 were SS2.4880 and SS2.4860 per US$1, respectively, for telegraphic transfers. The authorized banks are free to deal spot and forward in all currencies. Singapore and Brunei currency notes and coins are freely interchangeable, at par and without charge, in the two countries concerned, at the commercial banks and with the monetary authorities. Singapore formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from November 9, 1968. Administration of Control The Monetary Authority of Singapore administers ex- change control. Much of the authority for approving normal current payments is delegated to commercial banks autho- rized for this purpose. The Trade Division of the Ministry of Finance administers import and export controls. Prescription of Currency Singapore has ceased to be a Scheduled Territory in terms of the U.K. Exchange Control Act, 1947 but under current U.K. exchange control regulations continues to be regarded as a country of the Overseas Sterling Area. Singapore has made no changes in the list of Scheduled Territories (covering Singapore and all other Sterling Area territories) which ap- pears in the first schedule to the Singapore Exchange Control Act. All payments to and from the Scheduled Territories may be made in either a Scheduled Territory currency or a speci- fied currency. * Certain payments to Poland, Romania, and the U.S.S.R. must be made through special accounts. Pay- ments to other countries outside the Scheduled Territories except Rhodesia may be made in Singapore dollars or another currency of the Scheduled Territories through an External Account, or in any non-Scheduled Territory currency other than Rhodesian currency. Receipts from exports to other countries outside the Scheduled Territories except Rhodesia must be obtained in either Singapore dollars or another cur- rency of the Scheduled Territories through an External Ac- count, or in any specified currency. Special regulations apply to settlements with Rhodesia. 1 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. The accounts of residents of other Scheduled Territories are treated as resident accounts. The accounts of residents of countries outside the Scheduled Territories are treated as nonresident accounts and, unless specially restricted, are des- ignated External Accounts. External Accounts may be cred- ited with the proceeds of any non-Scheduled Territory currency, other than Rhodesian currency, sold to a bank in Singapore, with transfers of Singapore dollars or sterling from other External Accounts, and with funds eligible for transfer to countries outside the Scheduled Territories. Bal- ances on External Accounts may be transferred to any other account, whether resident or nonresident, and may be con- verted into any non-Scheduled Territory currency other than Rhodesian currency. Accounts of residents of Rhodesia are designated Rhodesian Accounts. All debits and credits to such accounts require prior approval. Imports and Import Payments Virtually all imports are permitted freely under open gen- eral license or specific licenses depending on the nature and origin of the goods. A few imports are controlled for health or security reasons, and in such cases certain conditions must be satisfied before licenses are issued. Some imports have been restricted for the protection of local industries. By the end of 1973, however, all quantitative restrictions had been removed and only 20 commodities, including rice, required specific licenses irrespective of origin. All imports originating in Rhodesia, South Africa, or any territory administered by either are prohibited. Furthermore, the open general license does not apply to goods originating in, wholly or mainly manufactured in, or consigned from Albania, the People's Republic of China, Cuba, Czechoslova- kia, Eastern Germany, Mongolia, and North Viet-Nam, and license applications for such goods must be submitted through the intermediary of Intraco Ltd., which levies a sur- charge of 0.5 per cent on the c.i.f. value of imports from these countries. For imports of certain commodities, the open gen- eral license does not apply to Japan. Permission to make payments for permitted imports is readily given, provided that the prescription of currency regu- lations are observed. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to residents of the Scheduled Terri- tories may be made freely. Payments related to commercial transactions and personal payments of a current nature to other countries, except Rhodesia, are also permitted freely. Authorized banks are permitted to approve applications for payments in respect of many categories of current invisibles, either without limitation or up to established limits. Applica- tions for payments in excess of these limits, or for purposes for which no delegation of authority has been granted, are approved by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, provided that no unauthorized capital outflow is involved. 375 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SINGAPORE There are no restrictions on the amount of foreign ex- change made available for travel abroad; there is a basic foreign exchange allowance equivalent to S$ 10,000 a person a year for travel outside the Scheduled Territories and amounts in excess of this figure are allowed on application. Remittances to nonresidents of dividends, interest, and agreed profits on all bona fide investments are subject to exchange control approval, which is given freely. Unless spe- cial permission is obtained, not more than S$ 1,000 in Singa- pore notes and the equivalent of S$2,000 in foreign currency notes and Scheduled Territory banknotes (other than those of Singapore, Malaysia, and Brunei) may be taken out of Singa- pore by travelers; there is no restriction on the amount of Singapore notes, Malaysian and Brunei currency notes, and currency notes issued by the Board of Commissioners of Cur- rency, Malaya and British Borneo, that may be taken out of Singapore by travelers going direct to Brunei or Malaysia. Travelers visiting Singapore may take out any amount of foreign currency notes and Scheduled Territory banknotes (other than those of Singapore, Malaysia, and Brunei) that was declared upon en t ry. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Rhodesia are prohibited. Exports of certain textiles to Canada, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States are subject to quan t i ta t ive restriction, and all exports of copra, scrap metal, steel bars, cement, rice, and a few m inor items are restricted. Other commodities do not require an export license. Exchange control approval is required only for exports exceeding S$20,000 in value to countries outside the Scheduled Territories; this requirement serves to ensure that the proceeds are obtained in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Control Act and are sold to an authorized bank, normally w i th in six mon ths of ship- ment. Export proceeds up to S$3 million for each recipient in specified currencies may, however, be retained and may be used to make commercial current payments and any other approved payments to nonresidents of Singapore. Proceeds from Invisibles The exchange control requirements governing exchange receipts from invisibles are, in general, the same as those for export proceeds, inc lud ing the facility for the retention and use of up to S$3 million in specified currencies for each recipi- ent. Travelers coming direct from Brunei or Malaysia may bring in any amount in Singapore notes, Malaysian and Bru- nei currency notes, and currency notes issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo, and other travelers may bring in such currency notes up to the equivalent of S$ 1,000; otherwise, permission is required for the import of Singapore, Malaysian, and Brunei currency notes. Permission is also required for the import of currency notes of India in excess of Rs 270 and of Indonesia in excess of Rp 3,000. No limitations are imposed on the import of currency notes of other countries. 376 Capital There are no restrictions on capital transfers to and from other countries in the Scheduled Territories. Capital transfers from Singapore to countries outside the Scheduled Territories require exchange control approval. Inward transfers of capi- tal from such countries (with the exception of borrowing in non-Scheduled Territory currencies) do not require approval and the subsequent utilization of nonresident-owned funds in Singapore for investment purposes also is exempt from indi- vidual exchange control approval; however, government ap- proval is required for investment in residential property and in any vacant land other than land already designated prior to September 11, 1973 for industrial or commercial use. In- vestment by residents of countries outside the Scheduled Ter- ritories other than Rhodesia in Singapore stocks and bonds, whether quoted or not, is freely permitted in any currency, including Singapore dollars from an External Account. Pro- ceeds from sales of Singapore securities held in Singapore and of other investments may be freely repatriated by residents of countries outside the Scheduled Territories; the approval au- thor i ty for such transfers has been delegated to authorized banks. Borrowing from local banks by nonresident-con- trolled companies is not restricted. Investments by Singapore residents in countries outside the Scheduled Territories normally may be made only upon ap- proval of the exchange control authorities; however, residents are permitted to invest up to certain prescribed limits in securities denominated in specified currencies or in deposits in specified currencies with authorized banks or with Asian Currency Units. The exchange allowance for cash gifts and personal loans by individuals is S$30,000 a remitter a calen- dar year. Singapore banks that have been licensed to operate an Asian Currency Unit, and thus to operate in the Asian dollar market, may freely accept deposits in specified currencies and Scheduled Territory currency from an External Account from nonresidents of Singapore; banks require individual exchange control approval for corresponding borrowing or lending transactions w i th residents of Singapore. All transactions must be conducted over accounts held in the Asian Currency Units of the banks concerned. Borrowing in the Asian dollar market by resident exporters to finance outstanding export bills is in practice unrestricted. Gold There is a free gold market in Singapore, to which residents and nonresidents have free access; settlements between resi- dents and nonresidents must take place in a Scheduled Terri- tory currency to an External Account or in any foreign currency, while receipts from nonresidents may be accepted in any currency or against debit to an External Account. Both resident and nonresident individuals and companies are per- mitted to import, hold, negotiate, and export gold freely; imports and exports require neither exchange control ap- proval nor import or export licenses. A S$150 commemora- tive gold coin issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Singapore, is legal tender; this coin is treated for exchange control purposes as local currency and its export ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution and import is dealt with in the same way as that of Singapore currency notes. The price of gold used for the manufac ture of ornaments is fixed by the Singapore-Chinese Gold and Silver Merchants Association. On December 31, 1973, this price was about SS370 per tael for 24-carat gold and S$340 per tael for 22-carat gold. Changes during 1973 January 16. A reserve requirement of 5 per cent was im- posed on the net foreign liabilities of foreign and domestic banks established in Singapore. (It was increased to 9 per cent on March 16, reduced to 5 per cent on December 20, and to zero on March 5, 1974.) February 16. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Singapore decided to maintain the existing gold parity of the Singapore dollar. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously SS2.81955 = US$1, became S$2.53760 = US$1. March 23. The Monetary Au thor i ty began a policy of granting newly established foreign banks licenses for offshore operations only. April 16. Imports of wheat flour were placed on open gen- eral license.

Exports of rice were made subject to licensing. May 18. Import duties on cement were abolished. May 25. The import of certain steel products was freed from quota restriction and licensing. May 28. Authorized banks were permitted to sell foreign currency notes and coins to residents and nonresidents up to the equivalent of S$2,000 against payment in any type of currency notes. June 4. The Stock Exchange of Singapore started opera- tions. It replaced the joint Stock Exchange of Malaysia and Singapore. June 21. The Monetary Authority of Singapore ceased for the time being to observe the announced margins for the U.S. dollar. July 2. Residents of Singapore were freely permitted to purchase and sell gold bullion in Singapore. They were also freely permitted to export gold bullion.

Settlements in respect of bullion between residents and nonresidents henceforth could be made in any foreign currency. July 2. Residents of countries outside the Scheduled Terri- tories could buy and sell Singapore securities, whether quoted or not, w i thout specific approval. July 2. The exchange control regulations were modified to permit the issue of certificates of deposit denominated in Singapore dollars. (None were issued, however, in 1973.) July 2. The import and export of securities, whether Singa- pore securities or other securities, became freely permissible, SINGAPORE with the exception of negotiable certificates of deposit issued in Singapore; authorized dealers could import and export certificates of deposit expressed in foreign currencies without exchange control approval, but such approval was required for their imports and exports of certificates of deposit ex- pressed in Singapore dollars. July 2. The requirement that foreign currency securities must be deposited w i th authorized depositories was abol- ished, except for negotiable certificates of deposit issued in Singapore. July 2. Singapore residents and residents of other Sched- uled Territories were permitted to invest in securities denomi- nated in specified currencies and in deposits denominated in specified currencies with authorized banks and Asian Cur- rency Units in Singapore in the following manner: (1) Singa- pore residents who are individuals —up to a total amount of S$ 100,000 a person; (2) Singapore companies (other than unit trusts, mutual funds, etc.)—up to a total amount of S$3 million a company; (3) approved unit trusts, mutual funds, and investment trusts —up to a total amount of S$5 million or up to 15 per cent of their funds; and (4) residents of Scheduled Territories other than Singapore—up to any amount. July 2. Singapore companies could retain receipts in speci- fied currencies from exports and invisibles up to S$3 million at any one time and could use such receipts to meet their commercial liabilities due to nonresidents of Singapore; previ- ously, there was a time limit of three months on such reten- tion and use but no limitation as to amount. July 2. Inward direct investment and inward portfolio in- vestment by residents of countries outside the Scheduled Ter- ritories ceased to be subject to exchange control approval. Previously, all such direct or portfolio investments required specific exchange control approval. July 2. The approval authority for remittances of interest, dividends, and profits was delegated to authorized dealers. July 26. Interest payable to nonresident holders of Asian dollar bonds issued in Singapore with prior government ap- proval was exempted from income tax. The income tax rate applied to offshore income of banks and other financial insti- tutions granting Asian dollar loans to overseas borrowers (excluding any debenture bond note or other instrument is- sued by any person outside Singapore, or any loan made between financial institutions), was reduced from 40 per cent to 10 per cent. August 2. The limits and types of "sundry remittances" to countries outside the Scheduled Territories that could be ap- proved by authorized banks were increased. August 2.

Singapore became a contracting party to the GATT. September 11. Only citizens of Singapore could henceforth purchase residential property without any restriction. All others (permanent residents, noncitizens, and companies in- corporated in Singapore or abroad) would not be debarred from owning residential property but required the written approval of the Government to purchase or acquire residen- tial property or any vacant land other than that already zoned industrial-commercial. November 9. Import duties on 20 major product groups in the consumer and housing industries were lifted, November 14. Import duties on garments were reduced to ad valorem duties onlv- November 30. Import duties on footwear were abolished. 378 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SOMALIA Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.118193 gram of f ine gold per Somali Shilling, corresponding to So. Sh. 7.51881 = SDR 1 or So. Sh. 6.23272 = US$1, and Somalia avails itself of wider mar- gins. The Somali National Bank carries out exchange transac- tions in some of the "convertible" currenciesl with authorized dealers at fixed rates, taking into consideration those in leading exchange markets in Europe; on Decem- ber 31, 1973, the Bank's buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were So. Sh. 6.2327 and So. Sh. 6.3573. The exchange market in Somalia comprises the Somali National Bank and the commercial banks, operating as authorized exchange dealers in respect of transactions in foreign currencies. There is a foreign exchange commission (including bank ing com- mission) of 0.7 per cent for all exchange transactions other than purchases and sales of banknotes. Authorized exchange dealers generally do not conduct forward exchange transac- tions on behalf of the public, although this is not prohibited. Administration of Control The Ministry of Commerce is the principal government agency concerned with the implementation and operation of trade and exchange controls. It has been given the au tho r i ty to regulate and control all foreign economic transactions and to establish policy for the licensing of imports, exports, and exchange. The Somali National Bank is authorized to deter- mine the rates at which foreign currencies are to be negoti- ated, to establish a list of "convertible" currencies, l and to appoint authorized exchange dealers. The two commercial banks have been appointed as authorized exchange dealers. The National Bank may also implement the trade and ex- change controls on behalf of the Ministry of Commerce. An Advisory Commission, consisting of nine members represent- ing various ministries, the Somali National Bank, the Cus- toms Au thor i ty, and the police, advises the Ministry of Commerce on policy questions relating to the regulations and control of foreign economic transactions. The National and the Local Licensing Committees, usually consisting of mem- bers representing the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Finance, the Somali National Bank, the Customs Au tho r i ty, and the police, decide on applications for licenses for imports and exports and for transfers in respect of services. The So- mali National Bank grants licenses for certain rou t ine invisi- bles. Transfers in respect of capital are authorized by the National Licensing Committee in Mogadiscio, unless they are governed by the provisions of Law No. 10 of February 18, 1960 on foreign investments, as extended and amended by Decree-Law No. 3 of March 3, 1968 and Law No. 17 of June 15, 1968. Prescription of Currency Settlements with the People's Republic of China and the U.S.S.R. are made through bilateral clearing accounts de- 1 The "convertible" currencies are listed as Djibouti francs, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. nominated in pounds sterling. Settlements with Egypt must be made mostly in convertible currencies; 50 per cent of payments for imports from Egypt and all payments for invisi- bles to Egypt other than those for Suez Canal dues are to be debited to Somalia's creditor balance resulting from the ter- minated payments agreement with that country; other pay- ments normally are channeled through special accounts denominated in sterling. Settlements w i th all other countries must be made in Somali shillings or in "convertible" curren- cies (see footnote 1); however, residents are not permitted to make settlements w i th Israel, Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa. Nonresident Accounts Nonresident accounts in Somali shillings or in "converti- ble" currencies may be opened w i th authorized exchange dealers by Somali nationals residing abroad and deriving in- come only from sources outside Somalia; foreign nationals and foreign institutions enjoying diplomatic status in Soma- lia; foreign persons customarily resident abroad and compa- nies whose head office is abroad, provided that they do not derive income (including export proceeds) from sources w i th in Somalia; and by other physical or juridical persons individually authorized by the Somali National Bank to ma in ta in a nonresident account. Imports and Import Payments Imports of goods originating in or shipped from Israel, Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. For reasons of public policy, the import of a few commodities from all sources may be prohibited and that of certain other items requires individual license. All other commodities may be imported freely. Individual licenses are required for some 17 commodities or groups of commodities. Some of these commodities may be imported only from specified sources. 2 No quotas are maintained for any imports. The state trading organization (the National Agency for Trade, Ente Nazionale per il Commercio or ENC) is responsible, inter alia, for the import a n d / or distribution of certain commodities received under aid programs. It also is the sole agent for the importa- tion of animal and vegetable oils and fats, rice, wheat flour, coffee, tea, sugar, pasta, soap and detergents, bleached and unbleached cotton cloths, and certain other commodities. The Somali Petroleum Agency is the sole importer of fuel and fuel products, batteries, and rubber tubes and tires. The Min- istry of Health is the on ly agency entitled to import medicines while the Agency for Construction Materials is the sole im- porter of construction materials. Certain other commodities also are imported by state agencies only. All imports, whether subject to licensing or not, must be declared.

Not for Redistribution SOMALIA cations in the import license, a new import license must be obtained. All imports other than those made by the Govern- ment, diplomatic and consular agencies, and international organizations are subject to a statistical and administrative tax of 10 per cent. Payments for imports are authorized by the Somali Na- tional Bank or an authorized exchange dealer on the basis of either an import license (where required) or a "notice of im- port of goods not subject to license" and other documenta- tion relating to the import transaction (bills, bills of lading, shipping notices, etc.). Provided that the Somali National Bank or the authorized exchange dealer is satisfied that the transaction meets the legal requirements, permission to make payment for imports is granted to the applicant not later than the third business day following the receipt of the application or on such other subsequent day as may be specified by the applicant. The Somali National Bank or the authorized ex- change dealer may also permit advance payments for imports (i.e., payment for merchandise not actually passed through customs at the time of payment) provided that documentary evidence of actual shipment is produced. Advance payments for imports without documentary evidence of actual shipment are not permitted. Payments for imports from neighboring areas 3 are permitted only by letter of credit and by cash against documentation. Payments for In visibles Payments to Israel, Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. Payments for current invisibles are subject to licensing, mainly to prevent unauthorized capital movements; provided that balance of payments considerations permit, genuine requirements are met. Transfers of salaries, wages, gratuities, and allowances paid in Somalia to their foreign personnel by enterprises registered under the Foreign Invest- ment Law are normally allowed up to 50 per cent. The Somali National Bank may grant licenses for exchange for travel purposes up to specified limits. Applications for all other invisibles are considered on their merits by the Licensing Committees in Mogadiscio and Hargeisa. For tourist travel by residents, there is an allowance of the equivalent of So. Sh. 1,000 a person a year, which is applicable to all countries, except Canada, Japan, and the United States; for these three countries, the allowance is So. Sh. 1,400 a person a year. Nonresident travelers may take out without authorization any foreign exchange which they brought in and up to So. Sh. 200 in Somali notes and coins. Resident travelers may take out w i thout authorization So. Sh. 200 in Somali notes and coins and up to the equivalent of So. Sh. 200 in foreign banknotes and coins. A currency declaration is required by all persons leaving the country. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports and re-exports to Israel, Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. The export of a few commodities to any destination may be prohibited for reasons of public policy. An export declaration is required for all commodities. 3 Aden, Djibouti, Mukalla, Ethiopia, and Kenya. 380 Exports of bananas and eleven other commodities or groups of commodities are subject to license; other exports may be made freely. Bananas are exported only by the Banana Mar- keting Board. The ENC is the sole agent for the exportation of incense, myrrh, gum arabic, and charcoal. The export of salt, dried fish, and hides and skins also is a public sector monopoly. All export proceeds must be repatriated, declared, and offered for sale to the Somali National Bank or to an autho- rized exchange dealer within five business days after their receipt. The Somali National Bank may exempt exporters from the surrender obligation in respect of their export pro- ceeds. Where no banks are operating, an advance payment deposit of 15 per cent of the value of exports is required. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles must be repatriated, declared, and offered for sale to the Somali National Bank or to an autho- rized dealer within five business days after their receipt. The Somali National Bank may grant exemptions from the sur- render requirement. Nonresidents may bring in freely with them any amount in foreign exchange and up to So. Sh. 200 in Somali banknotes and coins; they must make a currency declaration when enter- ing the country. Resident travelers may bring in up to So. Sh. 200 in Somali banknotes and coins and are obliged, upon arrival, to declare and offer to surrender any foreign exchange or gold they bring in. Capital Payments to Israel, Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. Capital transactions are subject to licensing unless they are authorized by the Foreign Investment Law of February 1960 (as amended in March and June 1968). In accordance with the provisions of that law, foreign enter- prises must be registered with the Ministry of Planning and Coordination. For "productive" enterprises (i.e., those that engage in irrigation, improvement of land, establishment of factories, construction of aqueducts, and testing, analyzing, and drilling activities in connection with oil and mineral ex- ploration), profits may be transferred abroad freely up to a limit of 15 per cent per annum of the capital invested; the unused portion of this transfer right is cumulative for three years. Should profits in any one year be less than 15 per cent, the transfer right for the succeeding three years is correspond- ingly increased. The capital itself may be transferred abroad beginning five years after the date of registration. Profits resulting from other foreign investments may be transferred abroad up to a limit of 10 per cent per annum of the capital invested, and the capital itself may be transferred abroad over a minimum period of three years, beginning seven years after the date of registration. The Ministry of Finance, upon the recommendation of other ministries concerned, may extend total or partial ex- emption to any enterprise from import and export taxes, excise duty, income tax, and municipal tax for a period not exceeding five years. For investments registered prior to March 1968, the fiscal exemptions may be granted for up to ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ten years. Enterprises registered in or after March 1968 must, to the largest possible extent, employ residents; a program for the substitution of resident employees for nonresidents is to be submitted, for the record, to the Committee on Foreign Investments. Gold Residents may hold and acquire in Somalia, for numis- matic purposes only, gold coins that are not legal tender in any country. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jew- elry, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require permissions issued by the Somali National Bank; such permissions are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. Gold imported by jewelers must be melted down to a fineness of not more than 22 carats within one month. Imports are exempt from cus- toms du ty when originating in EEC countries and subject to a 10 per cent du ty when of other origin. SOMALIA Changes during 1973 January 6. Imports of means of transportation and agricul- tural tractors were made subject to licensing. January 6. Batteries and rubber tires and tubes were in- cluded among the commodities to be solely imported by the Somali Petroleum Agency. January 15. The export of salt and dried fish became a state monopoly. February 1. The Agency for Construction Materials was given a monopoly over the import of construction materials. February 24. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the par value was maintained in terms of gold. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously So. Sh. 6.92522 = US$1, became So. Sh. 6.23272 = US$1. The official buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were changed from So. Sh. 6.8560 and So. Sh. 6.9945 to So. Sh. 6.2327 and So. Sh. 6.3712, respectively. October 30. A cash deposit of 15 per cent was again re- quired for exports to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen and other neighboring countries. 381 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SOUTH AFRICA Exchange Rate System The par value is 1.04550 grams of fine gold per South African Rand, corresponding to R 1 = SDR 1.17648. How- ever, no exchange transactions take place at the par value. The South African Reserve Bank quotes a middle exchange rate for the U.S. dollar of US$1.4900 per R 1. Exchange rates are based on the Reserve Bank's rates for the U.S. dollar against rand (US$1.4937 buying and US$1.4862 selling, per R 1) and the London market rates for the currencies con- cerned against the U.S. dollar. Subject to certain limitations, authorized dealers are permitted to conduct forward ex- change operations among themselves and with overseas banks. The Reserve Bank provides forward cover in U.S. dollars only; such cover is given to authorized dealers at a nominal charge of 1 per cent per annum, for normal trade transactions only. The commercial banks' spot rates for the U.S. dollar on December 31, 1973 were US$1.4937 buy ing, and US$1.4862 selling, per R 1. South Africa formally accepted the obligations of Arti- cle VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement as of September 15, 1973. Exchange Control Territory For purposes of control over transactions in securities, residents of Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland are regarded as nonresidents. Otherwise, there are virtually no exchange or trade restrictions between the Republic of South Africa (de- fined for exchange control purposes as including South West Africa), Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland, and these are regarded as forming, w i th the Republic of South Africa, a single exchange control territory, the Rand Monetary Area. Administration of Control Import and export licenses are issued by the Director of Imports and Exports acting on behalf of the Secretary for Commerce. Exchange licensing is the responsibility of the Treasury, which has delegated this au tho r i ty to the South African Reserve Bank; in turn, the Reserve Bank has dele- gated to the commercial banks much of its licensing power. Appropriate exchange for licensed imports is made available by the authorized dealers upon presentation of suitable docu- mentary evidence. Prescription of Currency South Africa has ceased to be a Scheduled Territory in terms of the U.K. Exchange Control Act, 1947 but under current U.K. exchange control regulations continues to be regarded as a country of the Overseas Sterling Area. All countries outside the Rand Monetary Area constitute the Nonresident Area. 1 Settlements within the Rand Monetary Area take place in rand only. Settlements with residents of the 1 In the application of the Securities Control Notices, however, the Nonresident Area comprises all countries outside South Africa, and thus includes Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland. Correspondingly, there are two definitions of resident status for exchange control purposes. 382 Nonresident Area, except Rhodesia, may be made in rand to and from a nonresident account and in any specified cur- rency 2 and, for outgoing payments only, in any other foreign currency. 3 Settlements with Rhodesia may be made in rand to and from a local Rhodesian or other nonresident account, in Rhodesian currency and, for inward payments only, in any specified currency. Nonresident Accounts The rand accounts of residents outside the Rand Monetary Area are divided in to Rhodesian Accounts, Nonresident Ac- counts, and Blocked Accounts. Rhodesian Accounts are held by persons, firms, or compa- nies (including banks) resident, domiciled, or registered in Rhodesia. They may be credited with all authorized payments by South African residents, with the proceeds of sales to authorized dealers in South Africa of Rhodesian currency and of any specified currency, and w i th payments from local Non- resident or Rhodesian Accounts. They may be debited for payments for exports to Rhodesia and other payments due by Rhodesian residents to South African residents, for payments to the account holder while he is temporarily resident in South Africa for short periods, for payments to other local Rhodesian Accounts, and for the cost of purchases of Rhode- sian currency. Nonresident Accounts are held by persons, firms, or compa- nies (including banks) resident, domiciled, or registered out- side Rhodesia and the Rand Monetary Area. They may be credited w i th all authorized payments by South African resi- dents, w i th the proceeds of sales to authorized dealers in South Africa of specified currency, and with payments from other Nonresident Accounts in South Africa. They may be debited for payments to South African residents for any pur- pose; for payments to nonresidents for any purpose, i.e., by transfer to a local Nonresident or Rhodesian Account or for remittance to any coun try outside the Rand Monetary Area; for the cost of purchases of any foreign currency; and for payments to the account holder while he is temporarily resi- dent in South Africa for short periods. Blocked Accounts arc held by nonresidents of South Africa and are subject to exchange control restrictions. 4 They repre- sent ma in ly the proceeds from sales of South African securi- ties by a nonresident of South Africa to a resident. Such proceeds may not be transferred from South Africa or to another Blocked Account in South Africa, but may be re- tained on deposit w i th an authorized dealer, used within cer- tain limits for the holder's l iv ing expenses while visiting South Africa, or reinvested in securities which are quoted locally; 2 Aus tra l ian dollars, Aus tr ian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche m a rk, Fiji dollars, French francs, Hong Kong dollars, Ind i an rupees, I ta l ian lire, Japanese yen, Kenya shillings, Malagasy francs, Malawi kwacha, Netherlands guilders, New Zealand dollars, Norwegian kroner, Pakistan rupees, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Seychelles rupees, Spanish pesetas, Sri Lanka rupees, Swedish k rone r, Swiss francs, Uganda shillings, U.S. dollars, za'ires, and Zambian kwacha. 3 Foreign currency is any currency other than currency that is legal tender in South Africa. 4 Un l ike the other types of nonresident rand accounts, Blocked Accounts can also be held by residents of Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution such securities may be exported and sold abroad. If invested in government, municipal, or public utility bonds, the pro- ceeds on redemption at maturity are freely transferable to the nonresident owner, provided that he had held the securities for a continuous period of at least five years to redemption. Blocked rand may also be used to subscribe to a special issue, made available by the Government to nonresidents of South Africa only, of five-year transferable bonds offered by tender on a discount basis and repayable at face value in foreign currencies applicable to the domicile of the holder. In special cases, blocked rand may be used for direct investment in manufacturing enterprises. Emigrants' assets that exceed the permissible transferable amount, and the proceeds of South African securities held by immigrants prior to their arrival in South Africa or acquired abroad within three years of their arrival, are also blocked, but favorable consideration is given to the release of such immigrants' funds (see section on Capi- tal, below). Imports and Import Payments All importers of goods requiring import licenses must be registered with the Director of Imports and Exports. Most licenses allow the importation of a range of commodities, but they are, in general, to be used for goods as prescribed on the relevant import permit. Import licenses are valid for imports from any country. Imports free of license include (1) all goods imported from Botswana, Lesotho, or Swaziland and (2) all goods imported from Rhodesia, Malawi, and Zambia that were grown, produced, or manufactured in those countries. The Import Control Regulations for 1974, as announced in November 1973, distinguish generally between the following broad categories of imports: (1) Goods which may be imported without an import per- mit. This free list contains 650 tariff headings or subheadings and corresponds to some 15.7 per cent of 1973 imports. (2) Goods which may be imported only under permit but subject to automatic licensing for bona fide merchants and manufacturers. These fall under an unspecified number of tariff headings or subheadings and correspond to 70 per cent of 1973 imports. (3) Goods which may be imported only under permit and for which global quotas are determined from time to time. These account for about 7.5 per cent of 1973 imports. (4) Goods which may be imported only under permit and for which specific permits authorizing the import of these goods individually are issued. They cover some 6.8 per cent of 1973 imports. Provided that licensing regulations are respected and upon presentation to his bank of the necessary consignment docu- ments (proof of importation), an importer is automatically granted exchange to pay for the import. Payments for Invisibles There are no restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. All payments to nonresi- dents of the Rand Monetary Area for current invisibles re- quire exchange licenses. Authority is, however, delegated to the commercial banks to approve certain payments without SOUTH AFRICA limitation and others up to established limits. For current income payments, such as declared dividends, profits, royal- ties, etc., that accrue in South Africa, approval is given by the authorized banks without reference to the Reserve Bank, pro- vided that the relative royalty agreement was approved by the Reserve Bank and the profits or dividends to be remitted by nonresident-owned branches and subsidiaries are based on profits earned since December 31, 1959 and their remittance does not involve the use of local credit facilities. Favorable consideration is, however, given by the Reserve Bank to such transfers where the use of local credit facilities is not regarded as excessive. Income derived from securities acquired with blocked funds or otherwise held by nonresidents is freely transferable to the owner's country of residence. Limited amounts of exchange to pay for membership fees, family maintenance, etc., are authorized. The basic allowance for tourist travel in a year is R 2,000 for an adult and R 800 for a child under the age of 12. Separately, there is another annual basic exchange allocation of R 350 for an adult (R 150 for a child under 12) for travel to Malawi, Rhodesia, Zaire, Zam- bia, and Portuguese East and West Africa. Applications for larger amounts are considered on their merits by the Reserve Bank. Residents leaving South Africa for destinations outside the Rand Monetary Area may take out not more than the equiva- lent of R 200 in banknotes. South African Reserve Bank notes, however, may not exceed R 50 but are not regarded as being part of the basic travel allowance. Foreign visitors leav- ing South Africa within 12 months after arrival may take with them up to R 50 in Reserve Bank notes and any amount of foreign notes which they brought into the country or obtained from the disposal of instruments of exchange that they brought to and exchanged in South Africa. These limitations on the export of Reserve Bank notes do not apply in the case of Bantu returning to neighboring countries, who are permit- ted to take with them reasonable amounts in the form of banknotes representing their earnings in South Africa. There are no limitations on the export of domestic currency to Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of commodities considered as being in relatively short supply, or for which domestic prices are substantially lower than those obtainable overseas, require licenses irre- spective of destination (with the exception of exports to Bo- tswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland). Certain other goods are controlled for strategic reasons only, and permits are required for their export to all destinations but no import certificate is required where the goods are exported to the United King- dom, any Commonwealth country, any British colony, pro- tectorate, or trust territory, or the United States. The re-export of imported goods to countries outside the Rand Monetary Area is controlled to prevent commodity and ex- change arbitrage. Unless otherwise permitted, all export proceeds must be surrendered within six months from the date of shipment and 30 days from the date of collection. 383 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SOUTH AFRICA Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles must be surrendered w i th in 30 days from the date of their acquisition, unless exemption is obtained. Upon entry from countries outside the Rand Mone- tary Area, residents and nonresidents may bring in R 50 in South African Reserve Bank notes. There are no limitations on the import of domestic currency from Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland. Capital* Inward capital transfers require exchange control ap- proval; all inward loan transfers require specific approval, while inward transfers in respect of equity capital are freely permitted. Foreign exchange accruing to residents from capi- tal transfers and transactions must be surrendered. Outward transfers of capital by residents to destinations outside the Rand Monetary Area require the approval of the South Afri- can Reserve Bank and are usually not allowed; when fa l l ing under the Securities Control Notices, transfers to Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland also require prior approval. Local borrowing by nonresident-owned or nonresident-controlled firms is subject to limitation. Transfers by residents for the purchase of South African (or other) shares on the external stock exchanges are generally not permitted (except in amounts not exceeding R 2,000 for each shareholder, to allow South African residents to exercise rights arising from exist- ing holdings of shares in foreign companies quoted only on foreign stock exchanges), although South African stockbro- kers may engage in arbitrage transactions in securities, sub- ject to certain conditions designed to prevent any net ou tf low of exchange. Applications by South African residents to re- tain in, or transfer to, neighboring territories (this term ex- cludes Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland) funds for bona fide long-term investment in specific development projects or for the expansion of existing projects that are owned or con- trolled by South Africans are considered by the South African Reserve Bank and the Treasury on their merits. For three years after their arrival in South Africa, immigrants may dispose of their foreign assets held outside the Rand Mone- tary Area and also invest in South African securities abroad. However, the proceeds from the sale of all South African securities brought in by immigrants are blocked; the blocking is normally for at least three years, but the restriction may be removed on amounts up to R 20,000 or more, to enable the immigrant to set up a home and to meet current living ex- penses. The proceeds of the sale of South African securities by nonresidents of South Africa to residents must be credited to Blocked Accounts (see section on Nonresident Accounts, above). The following payments related to nonresident capi- tal may be carried out by the authorized banks w i thout refer- ence to the South African Reserve Bank: transfers to nonresidents of South Africa of the proceeds on ma tu r i ty of government, municipal, and public u t i l i ty bonds and national 5 For purposes of the application of the Securities Control Notices, a nonresident is defined as a person whose normal place of residence or domicile is outside South Africa. For all other exchange control purposes, a nonresident is a person whose normal place of residence or domicile is outside the Rand Mone tary Area. 384 savings certificates, provided that they were registered in the name of the nonresident transferee (who was not an emigrant) on June 16, 1961, or, if the stocks were acquired after June 16, 1961, provided that they are registered continuously in the beneficial owner's name for a period of not less than five years to redemption; normal capital repayments to nonresi- dents of South Africa by certain "dying" mines in regular periodic installments not exceeding in any one year 10 per cent of the nominal value per share; transfers to nonresi- dent owners of any balance of up to R 50 left over from the reinvestment of blocked funds; and transfers of up to R 20,000 to a nonresident beneficiary from the proceeds of legacies from estates in South Africa that hold no foreign assets. Emigrant families whose assets do not exceed R 20,000 may have R 10,000 transferred outside South Africa as a settling-in allowance, and those with greater assets may have 50 per cent of their assets, up to R 30,000, transferred; any balance exceeding the permissible transferable amount is blocked. Emigrants may, however, utilize such blocked funds up to an amount of R 30,000 a family unit to subscribe to the five-year nonresident bonds issued by the Government on a tender basis (see section on Nonresident Accounts, above). The South African Reserve Bank approves transfers of repayments at ma tur i ty to nonresident holders of mortgage bonds registered in their names on or before June 16, 1961. Favorable consideration is given for the transfer by nonresi- dent-owned branches and subsidiaries of open or approved loan account balances or undistributed current profits, or for the transfer of any dividends by them, provided that the remittance does not involve the use of local credit facilities. The physical export from South Africa of nonresident-owned securities is permitted, except by emigrants in excess of their settling-in allowance. There are normally three ways in which holders of blocked rand (including holders resident in Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland) can repatriate funds from South Africa: (1) by taking up special nonresident bonds issued by the Govern- ment (see above)—these mature in five years, when the re- demption proceeds may be withdrawn at the official rate; (2) by holding certain government, municipal, and public utility bonds and national savings certificates for at least five years to redemption, when the proceeds can be transferred abroad at the official rate; and (3) by exporting South African shares bought on the Johannesburg stock exchange, provided that they have been restrictively endorsed, and selling them out- side South Africa at a price which may involve a premium or a discount on the South African quotation; on December 31, 1973, the corresponding discount on blocked rand was about 21 per cent. Gold Residents of South Africa may purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in South Africa for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents of South Africa other than the mone- tary authorities, authorized dealers, registered gold produc- ers, and authorized industrial and professional users are not allowed to purchase, hold, or sell gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. All exports of gold require the ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution prior approval of the Reserve Bank; the approval au thor i ty has been delegated to authorized dealers in respect of exports of jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler (sub- ject to a written declaration to the effect that the jewelry will be brought back to South Africa on the traveler's return) and in respect of exports of gold jewelry by manufac tur ing jewel- ers (subject, except for exports to Malawi, Rhodesia, and Zambia, to a written declaration that the articles are in fu l ly manufactured form and that the gold content of each does not exceed 75 per cent of the selling price to the ultimate con- signee). Furthermore, authorized dealers may without refer- ence to the Reserve Bank allow residents to export for numismatic purposes currency coins, including gold coins, up to R 300 for each applicant during a calendar year. The gold-mining industry sells its ou tput to the Reserve Bank, except for sales effected on the industry's behalf in the free market. The Mint from time to time strikes gold coins that are legal tender but do not circulate freely in South Africa as currency; these are made available in limited numbers to resident collec- tors, while the bulk is sold in other countries. Imports of gold are confined mainly to coins for numis- matic purposes and to certain types of jewelry. Changes during 1973 February 14. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the par value of the South African rand was maintained in terms of gold. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously R 0.782891 = US$1, became R 0.704603 = US$1. The South African Re- serve Bank announced a middle rate for the U.S. dollar of R 1 = US$1.4193, and its fixed rates for the U.S. dollar were changed to US$1.4229 buy ing and US$1.4157 selling, per R 1. February 27. Authorized dealers were instructed hence- for th not to depart from the fixed public telegraphic transfer rates of exchange for U.S. dollars quoted by the South Afri- can Reserve Bank in their transactions with customers. Two permissible exceptions were indicated where authorized deal- ers could continue to accord a concession of Vie of 1 per cent in the spot rate, and foreign correspondent banks could be granted the same concession in the buying rate for the pur- pose of funding local rand accounts. (On April 25, this con- cession was extended also to the selling rate). Authorized dealers were, furthermore, obliged to observe as a minimum the Reserve Bank's fixed U.S. dollar rates in their computa- tions of exchange rates for other specified currencies. March 2. Exchange transactions were suspended. They were resumed on March 19, when the Reserve Bank was prepared again to buy and sell U.S. dollars at the rates it quoted prior to the suspension. March 7. A further relaxation of import restrictions came into effect. Some 120 items were added to the list of goods which could be imported without license. About 27 commod- ity groups which formerly could be imported only under individual specific licenses were transferred to the global quota list and certain other items were moved from the global quota list to the list of goods subject to automatic licenses. SOUTH AFRICA Additional quotas were announced as follows: for clothing, quotas were revised upward by 40 per cent of 1972 allocations and a fur ther 80 per cent increase was to be issued in August 1973. A fu r ther allocation of 40 per cent was also issued for consumer goods and all alcoholic beverages except for whis- key, for which the total additional allocation was 80 per cent. For confectionery the additional allocation was 80 per cent of 1972 allocations and fur ther allocations for confectionery and consumer goods would be made available later in the year. May 10. It was announced that the Banks Act would be amended to permit statutory control over the size of foreign shareholdings in South African banks. Foreign-controlled banks or bank holding companies would, in consultation with the Minister of Finance, have to reduce the foreign sharehold- ing w i th in a reasonable period to at most 50 per cent, and any foreign shareholding would eventually have to be reduced to 10 per cent. An existing foreign shareholding in a South African bank of more than 10 per cent and less than 50 per cent could not be increased and any additional share issues were to be sold only to South Africans. Furthermore, South African branches of foreign insurance companies would be required to incorporate locally within a specified period of time, and only insurers incorporated and registered under the Insurance Act would be permitted to conduct business in South Africa. Foreign shareholdings in South African discount houses would be limited to 10 per cent. By the end of the year, no legislation had yet been enacted to give effect to this policy statement. June 5. The South African Reserve Bank henceforth quoted a middle exchange rate for the U.S. dollar of US$ 1.4900 per R 1. New official buying and selling rates were set at US$1.4937 and US$1.4862, respectively, per R 1. The par value was maintained in terms of gold. June 25. The Hong Kong dollar was added to the list of specified currencies. July 16. Blocked rand held by emigrants could henceforth be used to cover the holder's living expenses while visiting South Africa. This facility was limited to R 2,000 for each family unit a calendar year at the rate of R 20 a day for each adult (R 10 a day for each child under 12). They could also be utilized to cover the local payment of the emigrants' fares in respect of travel direct to South Africa and /or direct from South Africa to their new country of domicile. July 16. Two additional facilities for the allocation of ex- change for business travel were introduced. One provided for an omnibus application to be submitted by any individual firm to the Reserve Bank, while the other involved the grant- ing to individual companies by the Reserve Bank of an overall limit for allocation, at the company's discretion, of the foreign exchange authorized to its individual representatives. July 16. The rules governing remittances for study pur- poses were eased. July 16. The rules governing the transfer by life insurance offices of life policies from South African registers to a regis- ter in any country outside the Republic were eased. August 16. An additional 66 types of import items were transferred to the free list. Supplementary allocations of li- censes were announced as follows: 80 per cent for consumer 385 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SOUTH AFRICA goods, clothing, and whiskey; and 40 per cent for other alco- holic beverages and confectionery. August 31. Exports of seed cotton and cotton lint were brought under licensing control. Licenses were not normally issued. September 1. The rules governing the import and export of South African Reserve Bank notes were simplified and tight- ened. Henceforth residents going to other countries outside the Rand Monetary Area could take out R 50 in South Afri- can Reserve Bank notes and bring in the same amount on return. Visitors to South Africa from countries outside the Rand Monetary Area also were permitted to bring in and take out R 50 in South African Reserve Bank notes. September 15. South Africa formally accepted the obliga- tions of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agree- ment. November 16. Further relaxations of import restrictions were announced. Fifty-one types of commodities were added to the free list. Control over 13 types of commodities subject to specific license was relaxed, either by a shift to global quotas or to issuance of specific licenses to meet the full reasonable requirements of importers. For 1974, an initial permit allocation equivalent to 60 per cent of total 1973 allocations would be issued for consumer goods, clothing, confectionery, and alcoholic beverages. In accordance with normal practice, additional permit allocations for 1974 would be considered during May 1974. November 27. It was announced tha t, while foreign-con- trolled banks would still be required to reduce foreign share- holdings to 50 per cent by 1983, they would not be obliged to reduce them further to 10 per cent. December 7. It was announced that, upon request by the South African Government, the International Monetary Fund had reviewed its decision on the policy of sales of South African gold to the Fund which had been adopted on Decem- ber 30, 1969, and had decided to terminate it. 386 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SPAIN Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.0126953 gram of f ine gold per Spanish Peseta, corresponding to Ptas 70 = SDR 1, and Spain avails itself of wider margins. The official intervention limits are Ptas 56.7237 buying, and Ptas 59.3350 selling, per US$1. The official buying and selling rates of the Bank of Spain on December 31, 1973 were Ptas 56.73 and Ptas 57.60 per US$1. l Official buying and selling rates for specified currencies 2 are fixed daily by the Bank of Spain acting in consultation with the authorized banks. Purchases and sales of clearing currencies are centralized in the Bank of Spain, which pub- lishes the rates at which it settles the transactions it carries out direct. These rates are the same as the prevailing rates for the U.S. dollar. The Bank of Spain also quotes buying and selling rates for banknotes in specified foreign currencies on a weekly basis. Authorized banks are allowed to operate in foreign mar- kets for spot transactions and forward transactions related to commercial transactions for up to 360 days; forward transac- tions with customers are restricted to currencies admitted to the Madrid foreign exchange market and to permitted import and export transactions with a ma tur i ty up to 360 days. Exchange Control Territory The Peninsular Territories of the Spanish State, the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands, Ceuta, Melilla, and Spanish Sahara constitute a single exchange control territory, the Spanish Monetary Area. Administration of Control The guidelines on foreign exchange policy are formulated by an interministerial commission. The Ministry of Com- merce is in charge of all administrative functions connected with the exchange control. The Bank of Spain is in charge of the operative functions (basically, the handling of the external reserves). Trade controls are administered by the Ministry of Com- merce. This Ministry also is in charge of the controls over Spanish investment abroad, private Spanish borrowing abroad, foreign financing of imports, and the registration of foreign investments in Spain. Technology contracts must be registered with the Ministry of Industry. Prescription of Currency Settlements on account of merchandise transactions and invisibles other than those with bilateral payments agreement countries may be made in any specified cu r rency ,2 but in practice they are usually made in the currency determined on 1 With effect from January 22, 1974 Spain ceased to observe, for the time being, the previously announced margins for the U.S. dollar. As a result, the peseta appreciated in terms of the U.S. dollar. 2 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, French francs, Italian lire, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. the basis of the country of origin or destination. Settlements with bilateral payments agreement countries3 are made through agreement accounts expressed in U.S. dollars. Nonresident Accounts There are six types of nonresident accounts: Foreign Ac- counts in Pesetas for Payments in Spain (A Accounts), For- eign Accounts in Convertible Pesetas (B Accounts), External Accounts in Internal Pesetas, Nonresident Accounts in Con- vertible Foreign Currencies, Bank Accounts in Pesetas with Andorra, and Emigrants* Accounts. A Accounts may freely be credited with (1) the countervalue in pesetas of convertible currencies sold on the Spanish for- eign exchange market; (2) amounts transferred from other A Accounts; (3) amounts transferred from B Accounts; and (4) any interest payable on the account concerned. These ac- counts may freely be debited for (1) any payment in pesetas in favor of Spanish juridical persons and Spanish or foreign physical persons habitually resident in Spain; and (2) trans- fers to other A Accounts. Debits for the purchase of foreign currency for remittance abroad are not permitted. B Accounts may freely be credited with (1) any peseta col- lections generated in Spain that under existing rules are trans- ferable abroad under powers delegated to authorized banks; (2) amounts transferred from other B Accounts; and (3) any interest payable on the account concerned. The crediting of amounts originating from A Accounts is prohibited. B Ac- counts may be freely debited for (1) the countervalue in pese- tas of foreign currency acquired on the Spanish foreign exchange market; (2) transfers to other B Accounts; and (3) transfers to A Accounts. All other entries on A or B Accounts require the prior authorization of the Bank of Spain. Private banks are required to make special noninter- est-bearing deposits in cash at the Bank of Spain, in an amount equivalent to 100 per cent of the increases after Octo- ber 18, 1971 in nonresident-held deposits in A and B Ac- counts (demand deposits, savings account deposits, or time deposits at less than three months' notice), and in an amount equivalent to 50 per cent of the increases in such deposits when held for three months or more (100 per cent of any increase after February 7, 1973). Furthermore, banks are pro- hibited from paying interest on any nonresident-held peseta deposits in A or B Accounts, whether demand, time, or sav- ings deposits. External Accounts in Internal Pesetas are designed to hold funds accruing in Spain to nonresidents that are not transfer- able abroad ("blocked pesetas"). Balances are freely negotia- ble between nonresidents holding such accounts; if the recipient of pesetas does not hold an account of this type, he needs prior approval to open one. These accounts may be credited freely with (1) capital gains realized on the sale by a nonresident to a resident of Spanish real estate originally 3 Colombia, Cuba, Eastern Germany, Egypt, and Equatorial Guinea. With effect from January 1, 1974 settlements w i th Eastern Germany took place in convertible currencies. 387 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SPAIN acquired with convertible foreign currency or with pesetas from an A Account, a B Account, or an External Account in Convertible Pesetas; (2) the full proceeds of the sale by a nonresident to a resident of Spanish real estate originally acquired with pesetas from an External Account in Internal Pesetas; (3) with receipts from the National Lottery (when no evidence is submitted that the ticket was acquired with for- eign exchange); (4) with interest received on balances held in these accounts; and (5) with transfers from any other Exter- nal Accounts in Internal Pesetas. They may be debited for (1) payments of personal expenses in Spain of the account holder and his close relatives (managers' personal expenses if the account is opened in the name of a juridical person); (2) the purchase of bonds and shares quoted on the stock exchange; (3) the purchase for the use of the account holder of town and country properties that do not represent investment for com- mercial, industrial, or agricultural purposes; (4) the purchase of National Lottery tickets; and (5) transfers to any other External Accounts in Internal Pesetas. All other entries on these accounts require prior authorization and the accounts may not be overdrawn. Nonresident Accounts in Convertible Foreign Currencies may be held by nonresident foreign nationals, nonresident Spanish nationals, and nonresident firms or banks; resident foreign nationals may maintain such accounts only if opened before January 1, 1968. The deposits may be either sight or time deposits. The accounts may be credited with convertible currencies quoted in the Spanish exchange market and with any amount of interest. They may be debited freely for recon- version into the currency initially deposited, for the purchase of other convertible currencies quoted in the Spanish ex- change market, and for conversion into pesetas, including the transfers to an A Account or a B Account. Overdrafts are prohibited except for mail credits in favor of foreign banks. Emigrants' Accounts—Since October 29, 1970, commercial banks have been authorized to open savings accounts in con- vertible pesetas for Spaniards working abroad. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Rhodesia are prohibited. Most imports are admitted under the following arrangements: (1) free im- ports, (2) global quotas, (3) state trading, and (4) individual licensing, also referred to as the "bilateral import regime." All imports require either an import license or an "import decla- ration" issued by the Directorate-General of Tariff Policy and Imports. Provided that import prices are not considered ab- normal, import declarations are issued freely for a large num- ber of goods (mostly foodstuffs not under state trading, raw materials, capital goods, and spare parts, but also some con- sumer goods) included in an import free list that applies to most countries with which Spain has no bilateral payments agreements; the free list also applies to specified imports from Iran and Japan. 4 All other imports require licenses. There are global quotas for specified imports from countries to which the free list applies, but licenses are usually 4 The import free list does not apply to the payments agreement countries (except Egypt) or to Afghanistan, Albania, Andorra, Bhutan, People's Republic of China, North Korea, Laos, Mongolia, Nepal, North Viet-Nam, San Marino, Tibet, and U.S.S.R. 388 granted for larger amounts. 5 With certain exceptions, the global quota regime also applies to goods of Japanese origin. Licenses for specified imports from Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the U.S.S.R. are issued freely. Imports of raw cotton, certain other agricultural prod- ucts, some raw materials, petroleum products, and tobacco are state traded; some goods formally listed as being subject to state trading, such as feedgrains, may in fact be freely imported by private traders. Imports of certain agricultural products that are free of quantitative restriction and previ- ously were state traded are subject to variable import levies. Import subsidies are paid on certain foodstuffs and specified other essential commodities. Exchange in the appropriate currency to pay for authorized imports is granted freely. Ex- cept for capital goods, suppliers' credit for imports is not normally permitted to exceed 90 days. All import transac- tions must be domiciled with an authorized bank, and the import payment must be made through the intermediary of the bank of domiciliation; exempt from domiciliation are transactions whose value is less than Ptas 500,000 provided that payment is to be made within one year. Payments for Invisibles All transfers abroad and payments by residents in favor of nonresidents on account of current invisibles are subject to authorization, for the purpose of checking capital transac- tions. Payments up to Ptas 5,000 for any purpose may be made freely. For a large proportion of invisibles, the banks are authorized to sell foreign exchange freely, provided that the request is supported by appropriate documents. For cer- tain services transfers may be made freely up to a pre-estab- lished amount; for transfers which exceed that amount licenses are required which are granted freely. Holders of Spanish securities (excluding securities issued by private companies and acquired through direct subscrip- tion) may freely transfer abroad accrued interest, dividends, and proceeds from the disposal of subscription rights; the securities must have been purchased with convertible pesetas, with pesetas resulting from the sale of foreign exchange quoted in the Spanish foreign exchange market, or with pese- tas released on or after June 1, 1972 from External Accounts in Internal Pesetas. Profits and dividends on direct invest- ments are also transferable abroad without restriction. A general license permits the reinsurance abroad of risks in- sured in Spain with Spanish firms or with foreign insurance companies operating in Spain. Insurance contracts abroad may not be concluded, except where they concern exports and imports of goods. There is a basic tourist exchange allowance of Ptas 75,000 a person a year; however, amounts in excess of this limit are approved freely for bona fide tourist expenses. The authorized banks are also permitted to sell the equivalent of Ptas 2,000 a day for business trips, up to the equivalent of Ptas 100,000 a person for each trip. For larger amounts, the banks must apply for approval, which is granted freely for this purpose. 5 There are separate global quotas for imports of the same commodities from EEC countries. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Travelers may take with them Ptas 10,000 in notes of the Bank of Spain. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports are subject to prior licensing by the Director- ate-General of Exportation. Exports to all destinations of olives for oil production are suspended, while other types of olives may be exported freely. All export proceeds must be sold in the exchange market or to the Bank of Spain through authorized banks. Certain agricultural exports are subject to an export tax. Proceeds from Invisibles All exchange proceeds from invisibles must be sold in the exchange market or to the Bank of Spain through authorized banks. Travelers may bring in a maximum of Ptas 50,000 in notes of the Bank of Spain. Capital Foreign capital participation in Spanish industries of up to 50 per cent of the capital of the enterprise is exempt from authorization, while investment that exceeds 50 per cent re- quires the authorization of the Council of Ministers; for par- ticipation in Spanish shipping companies, the former ratio is 40 per cent. All investment in a few specified industrial and agricultural sectors requires prior authorization by the Gov- ernment. Foreign investment is not permitted in Spanish en- terprises whose activity is directly connected with national defense, public information, and certain public services. Foreign investment for the purpose of modernizing, ex- panding, and establishing Spanish enterprises may be effected either by transferring currencies that are negotiable in the Madrid exchange market, by using convertible pesetas, by bringing in capital goods, by reinvesting profits or capital transferable under the Foreign Investment Law, or by provid- ing know-how, patents, or licenses. All technology contracts require prior registration with the Ministry of Industry. Proceeds, including capital appreciation, from the liquida- tion of foreign direct investments made for the purpose of establishing, modernizing, and expanding Spanish enterprises may be transferred freely. Purchases by nonresidents of shares in most Spanish com- panies, as specified in Decree No. 701 of April 18, 1963 (including investment trusts but excluding those companies whose activity is directly connected with national defense, public information, and certain public services) are permitted freely. This applies to shares acquired by Spaniards resident abroad, as well as by resident or nonresident foreigners, either with convertible pesetas or with pesetas resulting from the conversion of foreign currencies negotiable in the Spanish exchange market. Proceeds, including capital gains, from the liquidation of such shares may be transferred abroad at any time, or used for further purchases of shares. The above ap- plies also to bonds and other fixed-income securities repre- senting debts of Spanish companies; there is no limit on bond holdings. SPAIN Investment in Spanish real estate by nonresidents is freely permitted if financed with pesetas derived from convertible currencies or from balances in nonresident peseta accounts (A or B Accounts). The Bank of Spain has empowered autho- rized banks to provide the investor with a document certify- ing that he owns such pesetas; this is the only requirement for official registration of the change in ownership. Certain in- vestments in real estate may also be financed from External Accounts in Internal Pesetas. Irrespective of the method of financing, country properties purchased may not exceed 4 hectares of irrigated land or 20 hectares of unirrigated land. When Spanish real estate is sold to a resident, the full sale proceeds are transferable if the initial purchase was financed with pesetas from External Accounts in Internal Pesetas, but only the capital gain over the registered purchase price is transferable if the initial purchase was financed with convert- ible foreign currency or with pesetas from an External Ac- count in Convertible Pesetas, an A Account, or a B Account. Outward capital transfers by residents require approval. Requests by firms to invest abroad in the same line of busi- ness are granted rather liberally, provided that the investment contributes to the expansion of Spanish exports; this includes participation in foreign enterprises. No authorization is re- quired for such investments when undertaken by Spanish enterprises with net assets in Spain of at least Ptas 100 mil- lion, provided that the firm's total foreign investments do not exceed 40 per cent of its assets in Spain. Other direct invest- ments are subject to more severe restrictions. Portfolio invest- ments by all residents and purchases of real estate abroad by private persons are severely restricted. However, registered investment funds with assets of at least Ptas 1 billion are permitted to place up to 10 per cent of their assets in foreign securities that are officially quoted on specified stock ex- changes abroad. Approval of requests by residents to grant loans to non- residents is based on criteria similar to those applied to resi- dents' requests to make direct investments abroad. Suppli- ers' credits from Spanish residents to nonresidents require authorization by the Directorate-General of Exportation; such authorization accompanies the export license. Before issuing the license, the Bank of Spain may be consulted about the granting of the credit. There has been no experience with the issuing of bonds in the Spanish capital market by nonresidents, nor with short-term credits granted by Spanish banks to nonresidents other than certain export credit granted direct to foreign importers. Credits to nonresidents for transactions with Spain may, however, be authorized by the Ministry of Com- merce. Also, the authorized banks may extend various types of credit to nonresidents, provided that this credit is financed with funds deposited in Spain in nonresident convertible cur- rency accounts; some forms of such credit do not require prior approval by the Ministry of Commerce. Local borrow- ing at medium term or long term by Spanish firms with foreign participation in excess of 25 per cent is subject to special directives. For transfers abroad of inheritances and dowries, authori- zations are granted liberally when small amounts are in- volved. 389 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SPAIN Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Spain for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. By law, only the Bank of Spain is allowed to import or export gold; industrial requirements are met by imports effected by the Bank of Spain. There is a global quota for imports of gold from member countries of the EEC. Changes during 1973 During the year import duties and compensatory duties on many commodities were temporarily reduced or suspended. January 1. Following the expiration of the bilateral pay- ments agreements with Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania, settlements with these countries were placed on a convertible currency basis. January 2. Imports of various foods tuffs were liberalized. January 24. The global quotas for 1973 were published. Their total value was over Ptas 17.6 billion. February 7. All day-to-day increases in credit balances on External Accounts in Convertible Pesetas, and renewed fixed deposits on such accounts, became subject to a reserve re- quirement of 100 per cent. Remittances of Spanish workers abroad were exempt. February 8. The Minister of Finance was empowered to authorize industrial banks to acquire more than 50 per cent of the capital of foreign banks and financial institutions. The 50 per cent limit on participations in other juridical persons remained in force. February 17. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Spain maintained its par value in terms of gold and continued to avail itself of wider margins. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previ- ously Ptas 64.4737 = US$1, became Ptas 58.0264 = US$1. New intervention limits were set of Ptas 56.7237 buying, and Ptas 59.3350 selling, per US$1. (Subsequently, the official buying and selling rates within these limits were modified on several occasions.) February. Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania were included among the countries to which the import free list and the global import quotas were applicable. March 1. Decree No. 48771973 was published easing, w i th effect from March 22, the restrictions on outward direct in- vestment and simplifying approval procedures for such in- vestment. No special authorization would be required for registered Spanish exporting enterprises with net assets in Spain of at least Ptas 100 million, provided a firm's total foreign participation did not exceed 40 per cent of its net assets in Spain and that the companies in which they partici- pated were engaged in their own line of business. March 13. Exchange risk guarantees for importers and exporters were introduced. They were available only for cur- rencies officially quoted in Madrid and restricted to losses of more than 3 per cent arising from the devaluation of the foreign currency concerned. Any exchange profits, however, 390 had to be surrendered to the insuring agency, the Spanish Export Credit Insurance Company. March 13. Authorized banks were empowered to conclude forward exchange transactions with resident importers and exporters for periods of up to one year; previously the limit was six months. March 17. Two types of nonresident peseta accounts, For- eign Accounts in Pesetas for Payments in Spain (A Accounts) and Foreign Accounts in Convertible Pesetas (B Accounts), were introduced to replace the External Accounts in Convert- ible Pesetas. A Accounts could be credited with the proceeds of convertible foreign exchange remitted from abroad and sold on the exchange market in Spain, but could be debited only for payments in pesetas to residents, not for the repur- chase of foreign exchange. B Accounts could be debited for payments in pesetas to residents and for purchases of convert- ible foreign currency for remittance abroad but could be cred- ited only w i th pesetas generated in Spain and qualifying for remittance under existing exchange control regulations. Transfers from B Accounts to A Accounts were freely permit- ted, as were transfers between B Accounts or between A Accounts, but transfers from A Accounts to B Accounts were prohibited. Any day-to-day increase in credit balances in A or B Ac- counts was subject to the 100 per cent reserve requirement previously applicable to External Accounts in Convertible Pesetas. The interest prohibition applicable to the latter was extended to both A and B Accounts. All External Accounts in Convertible Pesetas were redesig- nated as B Accounts, so that balances remained freely trans- ferable abroad through the purchase of convertible foreign currencies. March 23. Registered investment funds and closed-end in- vestment companies w i th assets or net share capital of at least Ptas 1 billion were permitted by a general authorization, with effect from April 1, to place up to 10 per cent of their assets or net share capital in securities listed on specified stock exchanges abroad. Purchases had to be spread over a ten-mon th period beginning April 1, at a maximum rate of 1 per cent a mon th. Implementing regulations were issued on July 20. Foreign securities so acquired could be negotiated in Spain between the funds and investment companies con- cerned. March 24. The basic exchange allowance for tourist travel was increased from the equivalent of Ptas 50,000 a person a year to the equivalent of Ptas 75,000 a person a year. The amount of domestic banknotes that travelers could export was increased from Ptas 3,000 to Ptas 10,000. April 9. The bilateral payments agreement with the Syrian Arab Republic expired. May 14. The Syrian Arab Republic was included among the countries to which the import free list and the global import quotas were applicable. June 5. Most import duties were reduced with effect from June 7. The average reduction was about 10 per cent. June 9. Imports of specified products were liberalized "for as long as present economic conditions continued." July 18. Additional imports were liberalized. They in- cluded sulphur, lead, tractors, television sets, radios, tape ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution recorders, and motor vehicles other than passenger automo- biles. (Imports of automobiles were not liberalized in 1973.) July 24. A new mining law, Law No. 22/1973 of July 21 was published. Section VIII dealt with participation by for- eign physical and juridical persons; such participation would generally be limited to 49 per cent of any rights granted. July 26. Decree No. 1794/1973 established a Direction General de Transacciones Exteriores within the Ministry of Commerce to control residents' overseas transactions (other than financial credits), foreign investment in Spain, and in- vestment abroad by residents. July 27. Decree-Law No. 6/1973 of July 17 and Decree No. 1791/1973 of July 26 were published. They abolished the Spanish Foreign Exchange Institute (IEME) and the Oficina de Coordination y Programacion Economica (OCYPE). Some of the exchange control functions of IEME were taken over by the Bank of Spain, and all other functions were transferred to the Ministry of Commerce. After this reorganization, the division of functions was as follows: The Directorate-General of External Transactions assumed the administrative functions of IEME. These in- cluded the authorization and control of inward and outward remittances and of the bank accounts of nonresidents, and the authorization and registration of foreign guarantees for pe- seta debts; the Directorate-General would also be responsible for the authorization and control of foreign currency borrow- ing by residents for purposes of financing trade transactions. The Council for External Investments, presided over by the Undersecretary of Commerce, took over the responsibilities of OCYPE, including the processing of applications for in- ward investments with majority control by nonresidents. The Bank of Spain continued to be responsible for the day-to-day management of the foreign exchange reserves and for official settlements and movements in foreign currencies (including the control over the official exchange rates and the interven- tion points in the foreign exchange market). It would also be responsible for the authorization of foreign currency loans to residents for nontrade purposes. August 18. Imports of cocoa and cocoa products ceased to be subject to state trading and were liberalized. September 14. It was announced that imports of certain basic foodstuffs would be liberalized, while exports of such SPAIN commodities would be suspended or become subject to levies. Ptas 3.2 billion was made available for additional imports of various other commodities by official agencies. September 21. Decree No. 2343/1973 regulated the transfer of foreign technology to Spanish enterprises. Registration of authorized contracts with the Ministry of Industry (Director- ate-General of Industrial Promotion and Technology) be- came a prerequisite for the transfer of royalties and fees. October 11. Decree No. 2495/1973 tightened the controls over inward direct investment. While previously foreign par- ticipation in 18 industries was exempt from authorization up to 100 per cent of the capital of the company concerned, and for other industries foreign participation was exempt only up to 50 per cent of capital, henceforth foreign participation in excess of 50 per cent of the capital in all industries required prior authorization. Decree No. 701/1963 of April 18, 1963 amending the Foreign Investment Law of July 20, 1959 was revoked. October 15. Exports of olive oil in bulk and of rice were suspended. October 20. Exports of petroleum products were sus- pended. October 31. The domiciliation floor for imports was raised from Ptas 100,000 to Ptas 500,000. November 1. The liberalization of imports of certain indus- trial products, introduced on November 3, 1972 for a period of one year, was extended indefinitely. November 3. A Resolution of the Directorate-General of External Transactions permitted authorized banks to accept and grant a guarantee or 0wz/with respect to permitted exter- nal trade, invisibles from or in favor of nonresidents, and capital transactions. November 30. Decree-Law No. 13/1973 reorganized the Comisaria General de Abastecimientos y Transportes. December 1. An anti-inflation plan for 1974 was an- nounced. It provided for additional import liberalization and export restriction measures. December 19. Import duties on virtually all goods were reduced by 5 percentage points, for three months. December 21. Agreement was reached with Eastern Ger- many to place settlements on a convertible currency basis with effect from January 1, 1974. 391 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SRI LANKA Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.149297 gram of fine gold per Sri Lanka Rupee, or SL Rs 5.95237 = SDR 1; no exchange transactions take place at exchange rates based on the par value. The Sri Lanka rupee is pegged to sterling at the rate of SL Rs 15.60 = £ stg. 1 and the exchange rate system for the time being is based on this official rate for sterling, which is floating in terms of the U.S. dollar and other major currencies. Another effective rate of SL Rs 25.74 = £ stg. 1 arises from transactions in Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificates (henceforth called certificates), which exporters of nontradi- tional exports (i.e., exports other than tea, rubber, and major coconut products but including green tea and instant tea) and most other earners or recipients of foreign exchange are enti- tled to receive upon surrender of foreign exchange earned; on December 31, 1973 the corresponding exchange rate for the U.S. dollar was SL Rs 11.1284 = US$1. Nonresident travel- ers when converting foreign exchange into Sri Lanka rupees at the official rate may also receive either corresponding cer- tificates or their cash value in rupees. The certificates are denominated in Sri Lanka rupees and are issued with a face value equivalent at the official rate to the foreign exchange surrendered; they are transferable within 30 days of the date of issue and may also be surrendered to the commercial banks for encashment at a price of SL Rs 65 per SL Rs 100 in certificates. Additional certificates are sold by commercial banks on behalf of the Central Bank of Ceylon upon demand and at the same price; such certificates are not transferable. Certificates with a face value corresponding at the official rate to the amount of foreign exchange required must be surren- dered when purchasing foreign exchange for payments in respect of most imports and most invisibles. The commercial banks deal in certificates for up to four months forward, at SL Rs 66 selling, and SL Rs 64 buying, per SL Rs 100 certificate; transactions are permitted only when relating to anticipated genuine payments and receipts in foreign ex- change to which the certificate requirements or privileges are applicable. The official exchange rate is applicable to receipts from major exports and to payments for "A category" imports (most staple food items, fertilizers, drugs, and certain other imports classified as essentials), as well as some invisibles. The Central Bank deals in U.S. dollars, sterling, and Indian rupees only. While its rates for sterling and the Indian rupee are fixed, the Central Bank determines exchange parities for some 20 other foreign currencies, including the U.S. dollar, from time to time on the basis of London market rates for those currencies. Rates for other foreign currencies are deter- mined by commercial banks, also on the basis of London market rates. On December 31, 1973 the Central Bank's buy- ing and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were SL Rs 6.7425 and SL Rs 6.745, respectively, per US$1. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Department of Exchange Control of the Central Bank of Ceylon as agent of 392 the Government. A foreign exchange budget, including an import program, is drawn up annually by the Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs. All remittances of foreign exchange in Sri Lanka must be made through banks autho- rized to carry out operations in foreign currencies in accor- dance with the exchange control procedures prescribed by the Controller of Exchange. Remittances may also be made through post offices, under permits issued by the Controller of Exchange. Licenses for most imports of the industrial sec- tor, both private and public, are issued by the Actual Users Division of the Ministry of Industries and Scientific Affairs. Otherwise, import and export licensing is handled by the Controller of Imports and Exports. Prescription of Currency Sri Lanka has ceased to be a Scheduled Territory in terms of the U.K. Exchange Control Act, 1947 but under current U.K. exchange control regulations continues to be regarded as a country of the Overseas Sterling Area. Payments to countries that prior to June 23, 1972 were Scheduled Territo- ries may continue to be made in the currencies of such countries, and receipts from such countries continue to be acceptable in the currencies of such countries. Settlements with ten countries with which Sri Lanka has bilateral payments agreements 1 and with Egypt must be made through the relevant special accounts. Payments to all other countries except Rhodesia may be made by crediting sterling or Sri Lanka rupees to a sterling External Account or an External Rupee Account, or in the currency of the creditor country. Furthermore, payments for imports not originating in countries with which bilateral payments agree- ments are in force (nor in Rhodesia) may be made in any foreign currency, i.e., any currency other than the Sri Lanka rupee. Receipts from all other countries except Rhodesia may be accepted in sterling or Sri Lanka rupees from a sterling External Account or an External Rupee Account, in any specified currency, 2 or in any other External Account Area currency marketable in the United Kingdom, i.e., freely ex- changeable for sterling. Transactions involving deviations from the general procedures require the prior approval of the Controller of Exchange. Special procedures apply to settle- ments with Rhodesia. Nonresident Accounts Nonresident accounts may be held in Sri Lanka by banks, corporations, or persons residing abroad. Transfers of bal- ances in these accounts to Sterling Area Accounts or External Accounts require approval. Blocked Accounts are used for holding funds that may not be transferred abroad and that are owned by nonresidents, repatriates, and emigrants. Such funds, unless they originate 1 Bulgaria, People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Hungary, North Korea, Poland, Romania, Syrian Arab Republic, and U.S.S.R. 2 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution from payments for imports, may be used in Sri Lanka for prescribed investments. Proceeds from the liquidation of such investments must be credited to Blocked Accounts. Also re- tained in Blocked Accounts is a proportion of local currency earnings, derived from the exhibition of foreign-owned films, if the takings exceed the amount specified in the import li- cense; such retained funds may be used by the owner for certain specified purposes, including the making of films in Sri Lanka. Special Accounts may be maintained in Sri Lanka by na- tionals of Sri Lanka working abroad. Credits to the accounts are limited to the proceeds of remittances from abroad (inclu- sive of the value of the certificates to which the remittances entitle the holder) but the accounts may be freely debited for payments within Sri Lanka. Balances in such accounts are exempt from wealth tax, and income arising from investments made out of such balances is exempt from income tax. Imports and Import Payments All imports of goods originating in or shipped from Rhode- sia are prohibited. Except for imports by the Food Commis- sioner's Department and certain minor imports (such as trade samples, gifts of up to SL Rs 250, and books up to certain specified amounts for each consignment), all imports require individual licenses. All imports are subject to quota restrictions. They are divided into two groups —the A category and the B category. Imports in the A category broadly comprise basic necessities, Western Pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, books and periodicals, and two-wheeled tractors. The B category includes all re- maining imports. The value and composition of imports are established by an annual import program. Imports of many nonessential items or goods similar to locally produced items are either prohibited or considerably restricted. The right to import is restricted to government depart- ments, government-sponsored corporations, and registered importers, although private individuals are allowed to import certain commodities for their own use, subject to special authorization. Imports of specified commodities 3 are re- stricted to government or state corporations, the Cooperative Wholesale Establishment, or the Lanka Salu Sala Ltd.; these commodities are referred to as "reserved items." In order to allocate foreign exchange, applicants for import licenses are divided into three groups: (1) actual users of industrial raw materials, machinery, etc., (2) those who import other goods for their own use and not for resale, and (3) established importers who import goods for trading purposes. Public sector imports shipped or transshipped from places served by vessels of the Ceylon Shipping Corporation must be carried in vessels owned or chartered by the Corporation, whenever such shipping space is available. 3 These include mainly rice, wheat, flour (except corn flour), unrefined sugar, refined sugar, Maldive fish, dried fish, cumin seed, masoor dhal, dried chilies, coriander, pulses, yeast and baking powder, garlic, fennel seed, mathe seed, turmeric, dates, sultanas and raisins, cement, fish meal, corn, caustic soda, cotton yarn, newsprint and other paper products, petroleum products, and textiles and manufactures of textile materials. SRI LANKA Holders of funds in Convertible Rupee Accounts may use these for certain imports, subject to approval by the Control- ler of Imports and Exports. An authorized dealer may approve an application to remit foreign exchange or to credit a nonresident account when the applicant furnishes or undertakes to furnish, evidence of im- portation and the cost of the goods together with a valid importer's copy and an exchange control copy of the import license. Payment for imports in the B category requires, in addition to the rupee equivalent of the foreign exchange in- volved, surrender of certificates with a face value equal to the rupee payment; imports in the A category do not require the surrender of certificates. Import licenses for certain imports (primarily food products, industrial raw materials, and ma- chinery) are subject to a minimum deferred payment term. Letters of credit against such licenses may be opened pro- vided that drafts are drawn payable not earlier than 6 or 12 months after the shipment in accordance with the terms of the import license. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require exchange control per- mission and, with certain exceptions, require surrender of certificates corresponding to the full amount of the foreign payment. Exempt from surrender of certificates are (1) certain official travel expenditures abroad; 4 (2) expenditures for cer- tain approved courses of study abroad; (3) remittances abroad by nonnationals for family maintenance; (4) certain provident fund contributions and life insurance premiums; (5) pensions and the final remittance, on retirement, of provident and pension funds; (6) expenditures of foreign embassies, official international organizations, and foreign diplomatic personnel; and (7) other expenditures abroad specifically ex- empted from the certificate surrender requirement by the Controller of Exchange. The remittance of life insurance premiums on policies in foreign currencies purchased by nonnationals residing tempo- rarily in Sri Lanka is permitted, and such policies are consid- ered as part of the assets available to them on retirement. Foreign exchange for personal travel abroad is only granted for furloughs of nonnationals. Business travel is gen- erally limited to travel for the promotion of exports and of tourism, and exchange up to a maximum of £ stg. 10 a day for a maximum period of 30 days is allowed in such cases. Exchange for educational expenses is allocated only for certain courses of study that will be of positive value to the country and that are not available in Sri Lanka; allocations are subject to the approval of the Minister of Finance, acting on the personal recommendation of the Minister of Educa- tion. For study in educational institutions in "Asian group" countries, 5 exchange up to a maximum of SL Rs 250 a month for undergraduate studies or up to SL Rs 450 a month for postgraduate studies is allowed, as well as SL Rs 250 a year 4 When met out of the budget allocations for a government department or ministry, a state corporation, or an institution exempt from the operation of the certificate scheme. 5 The "Asian group" is listed as Aden, Afghanistan, the East African region, Brunei, Burma, Egypt, Hong Kong, India, Indochina, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malaysia, Pakistan, Persian Gulf Sheikdoms, Saudi Arabia, Syrian Arab Republic, Thailand, and Turkey. 393 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SRI LANKA for books plus actual fees. For study in the United Kingdom, foreign exchange is made available at £ stg. 45 a month for undergraduate studies, and at £ stg. 60 a mon th for postgrad- uate studies, plus actual fees, and £ stg. 25 a year for the cost of books. Following the devaluation of the pound sterling in Novem- ber 1967, students in countries whose currencies were not devalued were allowed supplementary remittances to enable them to receive the same amount as previously in the currency concerned. For study in such countries (other than the United States and Canada), the maximum allowable is £ stg. 53 a month for undergraduate studies and £ stg. 70 a month for postgraduate studies; the maximum for the United States and Canada is US$225 a month and US$240 a month for under- graduate and postgraduate studies, respectively (in addition to an annual book allowance and actual fees). For travel and other expenses for medical reasons, ex- change is authorized if a certificate is produced from a medi- cal specialist in Sri Lanka and supported by the Director of Health Services that equally effective treatment cannot be obtained in Sri Lanka; the amount authorized will depend on the estimated cost, as certified by the specialist. Indian and Pakistani nationals are permitted to remit for family maintenance a maximum of SL Rs 750 a mon th or one third of their gross monthly income, whichever is less. Other foreign nationals are permitted to remit £ stg. 85 a month for a wife, £ stg. 80 for a boy in a public school, £ stg. 70 for a girl in a public school, £ stg. 60 for a child in a preparatory school, £ stg. 25 for other children, and £ stg. 45 a month less monthly income abroad for an employed child, up to a maxi- mum of two thirds of the gross monthly income when depen- dents are direct ones. For other dependents, this ceiling is one third of the gross monthly income. When the amount claimed on this basis exceeds one third of the gross mon th ly income, the excess will be treated as an anticipatory transfer to be set off against the amount the repatriate is entitled to remit upon departure. Temporary residents on short-term contracts are allowed to remit up to two thirds of their gross monthly income. Nationals of Sri Lanka are not granted exchange for family remittances. Commissions up to 5 per cent of the c.i.f. value are allowed on export orders secured through agents abroad. No remit- tances for insurance on exports are permitted; these must be covered with the Insurance Corporation of Sri Lanka. Holders of funds in Convertible Rupee Accounts may use these funds for travel expenditures and other current invisi- bles, subject to approval by the Controller of Exchange. Nonresident travelers may take out foreign exchange de- clared to the customs at the time of entry; they may not take out Sri Lanka currency notes and coins. Residents may take out Sri Lanka or foreign currency notes and coins not exceed- ing the equivalent of SL Rs 50 a person (SL Rs 25 for children under 12) once in 12 months, provided that they have been granted exchange for travel. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Rhodesia are prohibited. Permits issued by the Controller of Exchange are required for all commercial 394 exports, and exports to countries with which Sri Lanka main- tains bilateral payments agreements are subject to the ap- proval of the Director of Commerce. The export of some items is banned, and that of certain others requires export licenses issued by the relevant government agency. Rubber exports to the People's Republic of China, Poland, Romania, and the U.S.S.R. are under state trading. The State Gem Corporation has the exclusive right to export gems and ex- ports of private exporters are handled in their name by the Corporation. Re-exports of nonmonetary gold, silver, and diamonds are allowed only in special circumstances. The Controller of Exchange issues the permit for a com- mercial export when he is satisfied that payment representing fair value for the goods has been or will be received in Sri Lanka by approved methods of payment and, usually, within six months from the date of shipment. Foreign exchange proceeds from exports must be surrendered. There are special arrangements, however, for gems and nontraditional exports. Exporters may maintain special accounts, designated Con- vertible Rupee Accounts. These may be credited with 25 per cent of the f.o.b. Sri Lanka rupee value (inclusive of certifi- cates) of the net export proceeds of gems and with 3 per cent of the f.o.b. value of nontraditional exports. Debits to the accounts are permitted for imports, travel abroad, and other payments which are not of a capital nature. Exporters of all goods other than tea (including instant tea), rubber, coconut oil, copra, desiccated coconut, and fresh coconuts are entitled to receive certificates with a face value in Sri Lanka rupees equal to the f.o.b. value of exports, upon surrender to an authorized bank of the foreign exchange actu- ally earned. Exporters can use these certificates as supporting documents when buying foreign exchange for payment of imports, or for other payments abroad, which require the surrender of certificates. Certificates are freely transferable within 30 days from the date of issue; they have to be surren- dered to the monetary authorities or an authorized bank before the expiry of that period. Certificates are not transfer- able thereafter, but the holders can use them when making foreign exchange payments within seven months from the date of issue; at the end of the seven-month period, the valid- ity of the certificate lapses. Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange proceeds from invisibles must be surren- dered. Receipts under the following headings entitle the recip- ient to obtain certificates w i th a face value equivalent to the value of the foreign exchange surrendered to an authorized bank: (1) travel receipts; (2) insurance receipts; (3) investment income; (4) private transfers and donations; (5) small savings remitted to Sri Lanka by workers abroad; 6 (6) miscellaneous other inward remittances as determined, on a case-by-case basis, by the Controller of Exchange. Nonresident travelers 8 Since December 17, 1971 Sri Lanka nationals employed abroad and not availing themselves of the Special Accounts scheme for small savings introduced on February 6, 1971 may be required to remit to Sri Lanka a specified percentage of their annual earnings, if these exceed specified amounts. Compliance may be required for annual passport renewal. The funds remitted are entitled to certificates upon conversion but may not be used for impor ts or paymen ts abroad. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution are eligible to receive certificates corresponding to the amount of foreign exchange converted with authorized dealers; alter- natively, the latter may pay the traveler, in addition to the rupee equivalent of the foreign exchange sold, the cash value of the certificate. Part of the Sri Lanka rupee equivalent of certain proceeds from invisibles may be credited to Convertible Rupee Ac- counts; this proportion is 3 per cent of gross foreign exchange earnings from tourism, 25 per cent of foreign exchange earn- ings from professional and consultancy services performed by individuals, and 3 per cent of the proceeds from such services performed by firms, companies, etc. A traveler entering Sri Lanka must declare his holdings, including currency notes and coins. The amount of foreign funds that may be carried into Sri Lanka in the form of travel credit instruments is not restricted. The import of Sri Lanka, Indian, and Pakistan currency is not permitted; however, Sri Lanka notes in denominations of SL Rs 10 or less may be imported up to SL Rs 50, provided that evidence of prior export of such notes by the same traveler is produced. Other currency notes and coins may be taken in without restriction. Capital Investments of foreign capital are permitted in projects which are specifically approved by the Government, or, where the capital is drawn from a Blocked Account in Sri Lanka, in prescribed Ceylonese investments, including shares of public companies incorporated in Sri Lanka; capital trans- fers for direct investment in Sri Lanka are entitled to receive certificates upon conversion of the foreign exchange into ru- pees. Proceeds from the sale or liquidation of investments in approved projects other than investments made from Blocked Accounts may be repatriated, along with capital appreciation; transfers require surrender of certificates. Pro- ceeds from the sale or liquidation of investments not ap- proved by the Government may not be transferred abroad, but they may be reinvested in prescribed investments; the current income thereon may be remitted abroad. New foreign investments in Sri Lanka that are considered and approved by the Foreign Investment Advisory Commit- tee of the Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs are also granted special facilities in respect of remittances and taxa- tion. Investments abroad by residents are not normally per- mitted. Resident-owned securities on which the principal, interest, or dividends are payable (either contractually or at the option of the holder) in any foreign currency must be declared to the Controller of Exchange, and the sale or transfer of such secu- rities is allowed only with the permission of the Minister of Finance. Emigrants are not permitted capital remittances except on grounds of dire hardship, nor generally, remittances of in- come (including pensions) accruing in Sri Lanka. However, certain remittances of income may be approved to persons over 55 who emigrated before June 26, 1973, and pension payments to persons pensioned by the Government of Sri SRI LANKA Lanka who emigrated before 1964 have been continued with- out interruption. Repatriates leaving Sri Lanka for residence in the country of their permanent domicile are permitted, at the time of their departure, to transfer assets representing their retirement funds and a reasonable amount of savings as determined by the Government from time to time. For persons who have been in business in Sri Lanka, the capital they originally brought into the country plus a reasonable amount of savings are allowed to be transferred, subject to certain limits. Trans- fer of personal assets and of income thereon requires surren- der of certificates; exempt are (1) balances on provident and pension funds held abroad and representing contributions in respect of contractual obligations entered into before May 6, 1968, (2) provident and pension funds held in rupees in Sri Lanka, and (3) the value of insurance policies held abroad and taken out before May 6, 1968. Special provisions, governed by an agreement between Sri Lanka and India, apply to Indian families returning to India. Gold Imports and exports of gold in any form require licenses issued by the Controller of Imports and Exports with the approval of the Central Bank. Such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities. The People's Bank is the sole importer of gold. It sells gold in small quantities to licensed craftsmen and jewelers; the price charged at the end of 1973 was the equivalent of US$148 an ounce (calculated at SL Rs 6.77 per U.S. dollar). Small quantities are also sold to hospitals. Com- mercial imports of jewelry and of other articles containing gold are severely restricted. Changes during 1973 January 4. Western drugs and raw materials and packing materials for the manufacture of Western drugs were treated as category A imports. February 20. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the Ceylon rupee remained pegged to sterling at the existing rate of Cey Rs 15.60 = £ stg. 1 and continued to float with sterling. February 20. Retroactive to January 1, 1973 the Convert- ible Rupee Account scheme, previously available only for exports of gems, was extended to all earnings in convertible currencies from the following: (1) Exports (except black tea in bulk; crepe, sheet, and scrap rubber; and coconut oil, desic- cated coconut, copra, fresh coconuts, and coconut fiber); 2 per cent of the f.o.b. Ceylon rupee value (inclusive of certifi- cates, where applicable) of their export proceeds could be credited to Convertible Rupee Accounts. (2) Tourism, with 2 per cent of the gross foreign exchange earnings eligible for credit to such accounts. (3) Earnings by individuals from the export of their paintings, sculpture, and other original and individual works of art, and from the export of their writings, scientific, and other material for publication, with 25 per cent of the foreign exchange earnings eligible for credit. (4) Earn- ings from professional and consultative services rendered by 395 ©International Monetary Fund.

Imports under the loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development for the Maskeli Oya Project, Stage II, were treated as category A imports. April 9. Exports of coconut oil were suspended. With effect from December 1, 1973 limited quantities were allowed to be exported. May 9. The requirements relating to letters of credit on behalf of government departments, corporations, statutory boards, and government-controlled trading companies be- came applicable also to imports either shipped or trans- shipped from (1) Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore; (2) Gulf and Red Sea ports; and (3) Durban. June 1. The name of the currency was changed from Ceylon rupee to Sri Lanka rupee. June 8. The period within which export proceeds must be surrendered was extended from four mon ths to six months from the date of shipment. June 26. Persons emigrating on or after June 26, 1973 were allowed to pay for their transportation tickets in domestic currency if they were unable to arrange for tickets prepaid from abroad. They were also granted foreign exchange up to £ stg. 100 for a fam i ly unit. Both allowances were subject to reimbursement w i th in one year. Remittances of pensions or other income accruing in Sri Lanka to emigrants were not allowed except to persons who had emigrated before June 26, were over 55 years of age, and had foreign income of less than £ stg. 50 a mon th. July 13. All capital repayments and interest payments on suppliers' credit imports henceforth required the surrender of certificates, even where such imports were effected on licenses exempt from certificates. July 18. The requirements relating to letters of credit estab- lished on behalf of government departments, corporations, s ta tu tory boards, and government-controlled trading compa- nies became applicable also to imports either shipped or transshipped from any port in Denmark, France, Norway, or Sweden. September 13. The release of exchange for the import of any f i lm, photographic equipment, or any material, equipment, or accessory necessary for the production or exhibition of films required the written authority of the Chairman of the State Film Corporation. September 28. Payments for imports under trade credits of 90 or 180 or 365 days' duration (which originally were ex- empt from certificate requirements but became liable to certif- icates after November 10, 1972) were added to the category of payments exempt from the requirement of surrender of certificates. October 1. The Exchange Control Act was amended by the Exchange Control (Amendment) Law No. 39 of 1973. The investigative and penalty powers of the Central Bank were expanded. October 16. Two per cent of foreign exchange earnings realized in Sri Lanka on or after August 23, 1973 from profes- sional and consultancy services rendered by institutions, firms, companies, and other pluralistic associations hence- for th qualified for credit to Convertible Rupee Accounts. October 30. Balances in Convertible Rupee Accounts could be used as security for an overdraft or loan on an ordinary current account. Unutilized travel exchange issued against Convertible Rupee Accounts could be recredited to such ac- counts. November 3. Permissible credits to Convertible Rupee Ac- counts were increased from 2 per cent to 3 per cent in respect of foreign exchange earnings from: (1) exports of commodities other than black tea in bulk; crepe, sheet, and scrap rubber; coconut oil, desiccated coconut, copra, fresh coconuts, and coconut fiber; (2) tourism; and (3) professional and consul- tancy services rendered by institutions, firms, companies, or other pluralistic associations. November 29. Authorized dealers were informed that earn- ings from black tea would qualify for credit to Convertible Rupee Accounts only when the tea was exported as "tea in packets" or "tea in bags" of certain specifications. December 10. Authorized dealers were reminded that Spe- cial Accounts could be credited only with (1) the proceeds of voluntary inward remittances, inclusive of the value of certifi- cates; (2) interest on any Special Accounts maintained with the approval of the Central Bank as savings or deposit ac- counts; and (3) income from investments made with the ap- proval of the Central Bank with funds held in Special Accounts. Funds remitted to Sri Lanka in accordance with agreements signed with the Controller of Immigration and Emigration by persons obtaining passports and exit permits under the Passport (Regulation) and Exit Permit Act No. 53 of 1971 did not qualify for credit to a Special Account. 396 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SUDAN Exchange Rate System The par value is 2.55187 grams of fine gold per Sudanese Pound. The Sudanese pound is defined by law as having a gold content of 2.115368 grams of fine gold. The effec- tive parity relationship for the U.S. dollar is LSd 1 = US$2.87156. Fixed official rates for transactions in U.S. dol- lars are quoted by the Bank of Sudan (the central bank), whose rates for transactions with authorized banks and the Government on December 31, 1973 were US$2.87587 buy- ing, and US$2.86725 selling, per LSd 1. An effective exchange rate of LSd 1 = US$2.50 is applied to all exchange transac- tions other than the purchase of proceeds from exports of cotton and gum arabic, to which the exchange rate of LSd 1 = US$2.87 continues to apply, as a result of the application of exchange taxes and subsidies of 5.18 piastres per U.S. dollar (i.e., 15 per cent) to the rate of LSd 1 = US$2.87. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Bank of Sudan, much of the detail being carried out by authorized banks. The issuance of registration forms and the licensing of imports and exports (except those of gold) are the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance and National Economy, but all registra- tion forms and licenses must be validated by the exchange control authorities (Bank of Sudan). Import payments and other foreign payments are approved within the framework of an annual foreign exchange budget that is drawn up by the Ministry of National Economy and approved by the Eco- nomic Council of the Cabinet. Prescription of Currency Transactions with bilateral countries l are normally settled through the relevant bilateral account in Sudanese pounds or pounds sterling; however, most noncommercial invisibles ex- cept those payable to Egypt 2 have to be settled outside these accounts. Payments to all other countries and monetary areas (the "convertible area") may be made in Sudanese pounds to the credit of any nonresident account or in any foreign cur- rency, while receipts from the "convertible area" may be ac- cepted in Sudanese pounds from any nonresident account or in any convertible currency. Nonresident Accounts Foreign diplomats are allowed to maintain accounts in Sudanese pounds designated as nonresident accounts. These accounts must be credited with convertible currencies. Other foreign personnel working in the Sudan under certain con- tracts, as well as foreign nationals residing in the Sudan, may maintain Deposit Accounts in Sudanese pounds. Blocked Accounts are maintained by former residents; earnings accruing to these accounts may be used within the 1 The Sudan has bilateral payments agreements with Czechoslovakia, Egypt, Eastern Germany, Hungary, India, and Poland. 2 Payments to Egypt for Suez Canal dues must be made in convertible currencies. All other payments are settled through the bilateral account. Sudan by the account holder for his personal expenses up to limits established in each case by the exchange control au- thorities. Except for the crediting of interest, all debits and credits to Blocked Accounts require approval. Imports and Import Payments Certain imports are prohibited for protective reasons and others are not being licensed. Imports from Israel, Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa also are prohibited. Permitted imports generally are licensed or accepted for registration in accordance with allocations under the foreign exchange bud- get. Sugar is imported by a state agency only. For goods that require individual licensing, import licenses must be obtained from the Ministry of National Economy and validated (franked) by the Exchange Control Depart- ment of the central bank. "Nil" licenses, which also require franking, are issued for certain imports financed with foreign exchange held abroad by residents. Import insurance nor- mally must be taken out with local companies. Most private sector imports are subject to an advance deposit of 5 per cent of the c.i.f. value, payable before validation, and a surcharge of 5 per cent is levied on the c.i.f. value of all imports. If a letter of credit is opened, the authorized bank usually requires a cash margin of 40 per cent to 60 per cent. In practice, for many goods whose importation the banks are not allowed to finance, a 100 per cent margin deposit must be made. A stamp duty of LSd 5 is levied on the application form for each remittance in respect of private sector imports. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require exchange control ap- proval. Remittances are permitted for family maintenance (up to LSd 500 a person a year), educational expenses (up to LSd 1,200 a student a year for Western Europe, in addition to tuition fees; study in the United States is exempt from this ceiling), and for certain other purposes. Allowances for tour- ist travel to countries other than Egypt are authorized by the commercial banks up to a maximum of LSd 60 every other year for each adult traveling to Western Europe and the United States, and LSd 50 every other year for travel to other areas. Allowances for nonbusiness travel to Egypt, however, are the equivalent of LSd 50 an adult, and LSd 30 a child, a year and are authorized by the commercial banks. Exchange for travel must be purchased at an effective exchange rate of US$2.50 per LSd 1. Sudanese nationals resident abroad who remit foreign exchange to Sudan for conversion at the rate of LSd 1 = US$2.50 may at the same rate obtain foreign exchange equiv- alent to 75 per cent of the amount converted in any one year and use this exchange to make personal remittances abroad. Sudanese Government officials (other than seconded staff) and students receiving educational allowances at the official rate are not entitled to avail themselves of this arrangement. Salaried foreign nationals not permanently resident in the Sudan are permitted to remit their bona fide current savings to any country other than Israel, Portugal, Rhodesia, or 397 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SUDAN South Africa. Shipping charges, insurance premiums, profits, interest, and dividends earned by nonresidents may be remit- ted freely upon presentation of the required documents. The remittance of income accruing from blocked assets in the Sudan (including income from Blocked Accounts) is prohib- ited, except for earnings from investments in government securities made before 1970. The exportation of Sudanese currency is prohibited. Stamp duties are payable on the appli- cation forms for virtually all payments for invisibles. The du ty is LSd 10 on applications for remittances of profits and dividends, LSd 5 on applications for other transfers and for foreign exchange for business travel, LSd 2 on applications for foreign exchange for tourism, and from LSd 1 to LSd 0.25 on applications for remittances for other purposes; govern- ment remittances and those by diplomats are exempt. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Israel, Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. With the exception of cotton and gum arabic, all exports require a license, unless the goods are shipped to Saudi Arabia. 3 Exporters must submit an export form to an authorized bank. Authorized banks may approve these forms only if payment is in the form of cash against documents or against sight letters of credit; exports on credit require the approval of the Bank of Sudan. All commodities are subject to minimum export prices. The proceeds of exports must be repatriated and surrendered through an authorized bank, when the terms of payment are cash against documents or sight letter of credit, proceeds must be surrendered on deliv- ery of the shipping documents; in other cases a surrender date is usually specified. Some major export commodities are ex- ported solely by public sector entities. Proceeds from Invisibles Sudanese nationals resident abroad other than government officials or students may remit foreign exchange in convert- ible currencies to the Sudan for conversion at the rate of LSd 1 = US$2.50, and receive an incentive bonus of 30 per cent per annum which is paid on amounts so transferred to the Sudan and kept in a special account for at least six months; 4 75 per cent of the remittances so received may be repatriated at the end of the six-month period but in that case the bonus is forfeited and the remittance becomes subject to the prevailing exchange tax. Receipts from abroad in respect of invisibles must be surrendered to authorized banks and are subject to the general prescription of currency requirements. Travelers entering the Sudan may bring in any amount in notes and coins of other countries permitted by their regula- tions to be taken out of those countries. However, the impor- tation of Sudanese currency is forbidden. 3 On February 4, 1974 exports of durra, edible oils, and oil cakes and expellers were prohibited. 4 This bonus is payable only once, irrespective of the length of time by which the deposit period m ight exceed six months. W i th effect from January 21, 1974 the bonus was increased to 60 per cent per annum. 398 Capital Under the Development and Promotion of Industrial In- vestment Act, 1972, which superseded the Organization and Promotion of Industrial Investment Act of 1967, incoming foreign capital for industrial investment may be registered and thus may receive, among other advantages, a guarantee for repatriation of the original capital and profits thereon. Emigrants of Sudanese nationality may on departure transfer up to the equivalent of LSd 1,500 to their new country. Upon emigration from the Sudan, resident foreigners may transfer up to the equivalent of LSd 2,500. Gold Residents may purchase, hold, and sell gold coins in the Sudan for numismatic purposes. Subject to certain condi- tions, residents may also purchase, hold, and sell in the Sudan domestically produced gold. With these exceptions, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the Bank of Sudan; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the mone- tary authorities and industrial users. Some newly mined gold is exported for processing and then reimported. Changes during 1973 January 3. Exports of all types of oil cakes and expellers were prohibited. The ban was lifted on March 31, 1973. February 13. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, exchange transactions were sus- pended. On February 19 they were resumed and the effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar remained unchanged at LSd 1 = US$2.87156. February 19. A law came into effect which changed the gold content of the Sudanese pound from 2.55187 to 2.115368 grams of f ine gold. May 17. The private sector was allowed to export all types of oil cakes; previously, these could only be exported by state enterprises. July 1. Transfers in convertible currencies of savings by Sudanese nationals working abroad, which previously were converted at LSd 1 = US$2.50, were accorded an incentive bonus of 30 per cent, provided the domestic currency pro- ceeds, including the bonus, were kept in a special account in any bank in the Sudan. Amounts withdrawn within six months of the inward transfer would forfeit the bonus. Up to 75 per cent of each remittance could be repatriated by the account holder six months after the remittance proceeds had been credited. Amounts so repatriated would forfeit the bo- nus and be subject to the prevailing exchange tax of 5.18 piastres per U.S. dollar, i.e., would be transferable at LSd 1 = US$2.50. Subject to certain conditions, returning Sudanese nationals could bring in free of customs duties up to a lifetime limit of LSd 500 of goods. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution September 11. With the exception of cotton and gum ara- bic, all exports became subject to licensing. September 27. Exchange allowances for study in Western Europe were increased from LSd 840 to LSd 1,200 a student a year. SUDAN 399 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Exchange Rate System Nonresident Accounts SURINAM The par value is 0.457587 gram of f ine gold per Surinam Guilder, which corresponds to Sur. f. 1.94208 = SDR 1. Surinam has established a central rate of Sur. f. 1.78876 = US$1, corresponding to Sur. f. 2.15787 = SDR 1, and avails itself of wider margins. The fixed official rates for the U.S. dollar are Sur. f. 1.77 buy ing, and Sur. f. 1.80 selling, per US$ 1. There are also fixed official buy ing and selling rates of Sur. f. 1.75 and Sur. f. 1.80 for U.S. banknotes. The rates for other foreign currencies, including the Netherlands guilder 1 are set by the Central Bank of Surinam on the basis of the daily quotations for those currencies against the U.S. dollar in Amsterdam and the fixed buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar in Surinam, net of any commissions. There is no exchange market in Surinam. Administration of Control In principle, all foreign exchange dealings are subject to license, as are dealings between residents and nonresidents in domestic currency and other domestic assets. The au thor i ty to grant exchange licenses is vested in the Foreign Exchange Board, which has delegated much of this authority and issues licenses mainly for capital transactions and certain invisibles. The Board has authorized the Director of Economic A f fa i rs (or, on his behalf, the Head of the Import, Export, and For- eign Exchange Division of the Ministry of Economic Affa irs) to issue import and export licenses, and has empowered the Central Bank of Surinam to provide foreign exchange for import payments (subject to presentation of an import li- cense); the latter authority is exercised through the commer- cial banks, which have all been appointed as authorized banks by the Foreign Exchange Board. The authorized banks are empowered to provide foreign exchange for specified current payments w i thout requiring an exchange license. They may also accept free of license those inward transfers of foreign exchange that do not result from borrowing abroad; the tak- ing up of foreign loans is subject to Foreign Exchange Board approval. Except in the circumstances specified above, the authorized banks are not permitted to sell foreign exchange w i thout requiring the submission of an exchange license by the remittor. Nonresidents, whether banks or nonbanks, may freely open accounts in U.S. dollars with domestic banks; no over- draf ts are permitted. Nonresidents other than banks may freely open accounts in Surinam guilders with domestic banks; certain debits and credits are covered by a general license, while all others are subject to a specific license. These accounts must not be overdrawn, and debits for certain speci- fied purposes must not exceed a total of Sur. f. 3,000 a month. Authorized banks have also been granted a general license permitting them to open nonresident accounts in Surinam guilders in the name of nonresident banks; these accounts also must not be overdrawn. Imports and Import Payments Import licenses are required for all imports. 3 Some items, such as specified explosives and narcotics, are prohibited for reasons of public policy or health. Imports of a few other commodities are prohibited from non-EEC sources for pro- tective reasons and subject to quota when originating in EEC countries; they include coffee (roasted and unroasted), sugar, powdered milk, butter (in packs of 500 grams or less), most worked and unworked wood, and certain metal furniture. The import of prohibited goods may be allowed when there is a need for them, provided that they cannot be obtained in Surinam. Another group of commodities are subject to quota, irrespective of origin; these include matches, prefabricated wooden houses, certain women's wear, certain footwear, and certain wooden or cane furniture. Special conditions are at- tached to the import of copra, rice, butter (in packs of over 500 grams), wheat f lour (in packs of over 1,000 grams), ve- neer, and fu rn i tu re that is on neither the prohibited nor the restricted list; the import of these commodities also is re- stricted for protective reasons but the issuance of licenses is subject to administrative decision rather than to quota. A government agency, the Surinam Central Import Service, acts as the sole importer of certain staple foodstuffs. All other imports are licensed freely from any source. The import li- cense serves as a payment license, exchange being made avail- able upon presentation of the license. Most licenses have a validity of six months, within which period the goods must be landed and paid for. Prescription of Currency Payments for Invisibles Settlements in Surinam guilders between Surinam and for- eign countries other than the Netherlands Antilles are not permitted; they must, in general, be made in convertible cur- rencies 2 although payments to and from the Netherlands Antilles may also be made in Netherlands Antilles guilders or Surinam guilders. 1 All currencies other than the Surinam guilder are considered foreign currencies. 2 Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish k rone r, deutsche m a r k, East Caribbean dollars, French f rancs, Guyana dollars, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, Trinidad and Tobago dollars, and U.S. dollars. Payments for most invisibles require individual licenses. The commercial banks and the General Post Office have authority to provide foreign exchange up to Sur. f. 100 an item a mon th on account of certain services (bank charges, legal fees, membership dues, copy and patent rights, and so forth); up to Sur. f. 150 an item a month for advertising expenses and payments for books; up to Sur. f. 300 a year from each remittor in respect of gifts, subject to a limit of Sur. 3 However, two specified mining companies do not need licenses for their own import requirements. Similar exemptions may be granted to foreign companies for their industrial activities in Surinam, provided that they pay for their imports from their own foreign exchange holdings. 400 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution f. 300 a year on any beneficiary's receipt of gifts from Surinam residents; and up to Sur. f. 600-900 a mon th for the support of the remitter's own fam i ly in the Netherlands Antilles or the Netherlands (family remittances up to the same amounts to other countries require a license, which is granted upon application). The basic exchange allowance to residents for travel is Sur. f. 750-2,500 a person for each trip (50 per cent of these amounts for children under 14), depending on the destination; 4 the authorized bank must enter on the travel ticket the amount of foreign exchange sold and the date, the purchase of travel exchange not being permitted un t il three days before departure. Travelers may take out a maximum of Sur. f. 100 in Surinam currency. The export by resident travel- ers of foreign banknotes (including Netherlands currency) is limited to the amount of their travel allowance. Nonresident travelers may freely purchase and take out foreign currency up to the equivalent of Sur. f. 250. Nonresident travelers may also freely take out any foreign banknotes they brought in, provided that amounts in excess of Sur. f. 5,000 were declared upon entry. Payments due as interest on loans and as net income from other investments, and payments of moderate amounts for amortization of loans or depreciation of direct investments, may be made if an application supported by an auditor's report is duly presented to the Foreign Exchange Board for verification. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports require export licenses, which for most commodi- ties are issued freely, provided that the exporter undertakes to surrender the foreign currency proceeds to an authorized bank w i th in six months of shipment. Export licenses for cattle and pigs, fresh beef and pork, and planting materials are granted only after favorable advice of the Director of Agricul- ture, Animal Husbandry, and Fisheries. The export of ba- boonwood is restricted and that of rice is subject to special regulations. Certain exporting companies have received spe- cial permission from the Foreign Exchange Board to ma in ta in current accounts in foreign currency w i th their parent compa- nies abroad and to use these for specified payments and re- ceipts (including export proceeds). Proceeds from Invisibles Foreign exchange receipts from invisibles must be surren- dered to an authorized bank. Travelers may bring in foreign currency without l im i t, but not more than Sur. f. 100 in domestic currency; resident travelers must surrender any for- eign currency in excess of the equivalent of Sur. f. 500. Capital A decision of September 21, 1960 of the Foreign Exchange Board provides for the transfer abroad of capital proceeds from the sale to residents or the liquidation of fu l ly or par t ly foreign-owned companies or other forms of enterprise. The 4 Sur. f. 1,500 for the Caribbean area and Central and South America except Guyana, French Guyana, and Venezuela; Sur. f. 750 for Guyana and French Guyana; Sur. f. 2,500 for the United States, Canada, and Venezuela; and Sur. f. 2,000 for the rest of the world. SURINAM decision covers investments made by nonresidents with for- eign capital after July 31, 1953. It also provides for the annual transfer of profits and for the transfer at any time of the foreign exchange (including loans) imported by the nonresi- dent entrepreneur for the company's use. Profits must be transferred within a period of three years; otherwise, they are considered to have become part of the firm's working capital or to have been lent to the firm and may only be transferred in annual quotas of 20 per cent. An Investment Law passed on February 3, 1960 provides for additional incentives to private investment in Surinam. The Foreign Exchange Board grants licenses on applica- tion for transfers abroad from a deceased's estate, up to a maximum of Sur. f. 25,000. For estates of more than Sur. f. 25,000, further annual transfers are permitted so as to spread them over a period not exceeding ten years. The Board allows emigrants (heads of family) to transfer in foreign ex- change the equivalent of Sur. f. 5,000 in a lump sum and subsequently Sur. f. 5,000 a year. The head of a repatriating family is permitted to transfer the equivalent of Sur. f. 10,000 plus 10 per cent of his total taxable earnings in Surinam accrued during his period of residence; if his Surinam assets exceed the sum thus calculated, the excess may be transferred at a rate of Sur. f. 10,000 a year, or at a higher rate when this is necessary to ensure that the entire balance is released within ten years. Subject to certain requirements, residents may purchase or sell in specified countries 5 Surinam corporate shares that have been designated as negotiable by the Foreign Exchange Board. Transfers for investment in Netherlands or other for- eign securities or real estate by residents are not permitted, although exceptions may be made for direct investments abroad when it is considered that Surinam interests will bene- f i t. All borrowing from nonresidents by nonbank residents requires prior approval by the Foreign Exchange Board. The foreign transactions of authorized banks are restricted, in principle, to those undertaken for the account of their cus- tomers, and banks are required, in principle, to surrender to the Central Bank any excess of foreign currency purchased over foreign currency sold, but the Central Bank permits them to place part of their liquid funds abroad and they have received a general license to place abroad at short term U.S. dollars corresponding to the balances in nonresident U.S. dollar accounts. Gold Producers of gold may sell only to authorized gold buyers. Locally produced gold must be surrendered to the Foreign Exchange Board by sale to the Central Bank at Sur. f. 2,110 a kilogram fine for bars of at least 10 kilograms or at Sur. f. 1.80 a gram for unworked gold w i th an average smelting loss of 6 per cent and an average gold content of 940/iooo- 6 Authorized gold buyers are permitted, however, to sell nug- 5 Belgium, Canada, France, Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Luxem- bourg, Netherlands, Netherlands Antilles, United Kingdom, and United States. 6 These amoun ts are to be adjusted in accordance with the revision of the official U.S. dollar price per troy ounce. By the end of 1973 this had not yet been done. 401 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SURINAM gets at freely agreed prices to the public for industrial and artistic purposes; dealings between residents in gold bars and other forms of unworked gold, with the exception of nuggets, are prohibited. As local production does not meet demand for industrial purposes, the Central Bank imports some gold, which it sells to authorized gold buyers. Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Surinam for numismatic and investment purposes; authorized banks may freely negotiate gold coins among themselves and with other residents. Residents other than the monetary authorities, pro- ducers of gold, and authorized industrial and dental users are not allowed without special permission to hold or acquire gold in any form other than nuggets, jewelry, or coins at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require exchange licenses 7 issued by the Foreign Exchange Board; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports of coins by authorized banks, and for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, producers of gold, and industrial users. Residents arriving from abroad, however, may freely bring in gold, subject to declaration, and provided that they surrender it to the Central Bank within 20 days. Nonresident travelers also may freely bring in gold, subject to declaration; they may re-export the declared amount freely. Imports of gold coins are du ty free and those of unworked gold are subject to a du ty of Sur. f. 0.0375 a gram, irrespective of origin. The general tariff for gold ornaments is 60 per cent ad valorem, but those of EEC origin are subject to du ty at 50 per cent ad valorem. Imports of all forms of gold are 7 Import and export licenses are not required since commodities are denned so as to exclude gold. subject to a statistical fee of 1.5 per cent and a licensing fee of 0.5 per cent. Changes during 1973 February 19. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Surinam established a central rate of Sur. f. 1.78876 = US$1, corresponding to Sur. f. 2.15787 = SDR 1. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar remained unchanged. Surinam continued to avail itself of wider margins. March 28. Imports of additional commodities were re- stricted or prohibited. April 16. Import duties on many commodities were in- creased. July 13. The Surinam Central Import Service was given a monopoly over the importation of certain foodstuffs. Private sector imports of certain other items were restricted. September 1. The basic allocations for remittances to the Netherlands Antilles and the Netherlands in respect of sup- port and /or educational expenditure were increased in re- sponse to cost of living increases and exchange rate developments. Upward adjustments were also made in the basic allowances for foreign travel and for payments for books and advertising. November 1. The Australian dollar and the Japanese yen were added to the list of convertible currencies in which international transactions must normally be settled; the Ja- maica dollar was deleted from the list. November 1. Authorized banks were empowered to sell any amount of foreign exchange to consular officials of foreign nationality on departure from Surinam. 402 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SWAZILAND Exchange and Trade System Swaziland's currency is the South African Rand. The par value of the rand is 1.04550 grams of fine gold per rand, which corresponds to R 1 = SDR 1.17648. No exchange transactions take place at the par value. The South African Reserve Bank quotes a middle exchange rate for the U.S. dollar of US$1.4900 per R 1. Exchange rates are based on the South African Reserve Bank's rates for the U.S. dollar against rand (US$1.4937 buying and US$1.4862 selling, per R 1) and the London market rates for the currencies concerned against the U.S. dollar. Swaziland has ceased to be a Scheduled Territory in terms of the U.K. Exchange Control Act, 1947 but under current U.K. exchange control regulations continues to be regarded as a country of the Overseas Sterling Area. Swaziland also forms part of the Rand Monetary Area, which is a single exchange control territory comprising Botswana, Lesotho, South Africa, and Swaziland. For purposes of exchange con- trol over transactions in securities or gold, residents of a member country of the latter area are not regarded as resi- dents of another member country. The Ministry of Finance controls all external currency transactions. No restrictions are applied to payments within the Rand Monetary Area, and in principle these are uncontrolled. In relation to countries outside the Rand Monetary Area, Swazi- land applies exchange controls that are generally similar to those of South Africa, although Swaziland's treatment of certain capital transfers to other countries of the Sterling Area may be more liberal. Payments to nonresidents for cur- rent transactions, while subject to control, are not restricted, but applications for outward transfers of capital are consid- ered on their merits. The rulings on applications for inward and outward capital transfers may depend on whether the applicant is a temporarily resident foreign national, a nonresi- dent, or a resident. Authority to approve some types of cur- rent payments is delegated to commercial banks up to established limits; this is true, for example, of the basic ex- change allowance for tourist travel (the equivalent of R 2,000 in a calendar year for an adult and R 800 for a child) and a smaller annual allocation for travel to neighboring countries. There are no bilateral payments arrangements. Swaziland is a member of a customs union with Botswana, Lesotho, and South Africa, and there are no import restric- tions on goods originating in any country of the customs union. Imports from South Africa do not require licenses and include an unknown quan t i ty of goods originating outside the customs union. Insofar as Swaziland imports goods direct from countries outside the customs union, such imports are usually licensed in conformity w i th South Africa's import regulations. Import licenses are valid for all countries and entitle the holder to buy the foreign exchange required to make the import payment. Certain exports are subject to licensing, mainly for revenue and similar reasons, but most exports are in the first instance shipped free of license to or through South Africa. Changes during 1973 February 14. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the par value of the South African rand was maintained in terms of gold. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously R 0.782891 = US$1, became R 0.704603 = US$1. The South African Re- serve Bank announced a middle rate for the U.S. dollar of R 1 = US$1.4193, and its fixed rates for the U.S. dollar were changed to US$1.4229 buying and US$1.4157 selling, per R 1. June 5. The South African Reserve Bank henceforth quoted a middle exchange rate for the U.S. dollar of US$1.4900 per R 1. New official buying and selling rates were set at US$1.4937 and US$1.4862, respectively, per R 1. 403 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SWEDEN 1 Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.171783 gram of f ine gold per Swedish Krona, corresponding to Skr 5.17321 = SDR 1. A central rate of SKr 4.56 = US$1 has been established, corresponding to SKr 5.50094 = SDR 1, and Sweden avails itself of wider margins. Margins of 2% per cent are maintained for spot rates in the official exchange market between the Swedish krona and the Belgian franc, the Danish krone, the deutsche mark, the French franc, the Luxembourg franc, the Netherlands guilder, and the Norwegian krone. No announced margins are maintained for other currencies. On December 31, 1973 the buying and selling rates of the authorized banks for the U.S. dollar were SKr 4.57 and SKr 4.595, respectively, per US$1. Authorized banks may buy from and sell to other autho- rized banks any foreign currency on a spot basis against another foreign currency or Swedish kroner. Also, they may purchase, spot, from foreign banks and other nonresidents foreign currencies against any foreign currency or Swedish kroner credited to a Regular Account (see section on Nonres- ident Accounts, below). They may sell, spot, to foreign banks and other nonresidents foreign currencies against any other foreign currency or Swedish kronor debited to a Regular Account. The acquisition by foreign banks or banking firms of kronor on Regular Accounts is subject to limitation. Authorized banks may conclude with residents other than banks forward exchange transactions covering current pay- ments and authorized payments for periods not exceeding (1) 24 months in respect of receipts for exports, freight, and charter services; (2) 24 months in respect of payments for imports, freight, and charter services; and (3) 6 months in respect of other receipts and payments. Authorized banks may conclude forward transactions for a period not exceeding 12 months with other authorized banks, or under certain conditions, with foreign banks. Such transactions between banks may, however, be for periods exceeding 12 months if made in cover of forward transactions with residents. For- ward market rates are left to the interplay of market forces. Sweden formally accepted the obligations of Article V I I I, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as from Febru- ary 15, 1961. Administration of Control Exchange controls are administered by the Sveriges Riks- bank through its Exchange Control Board. 2 The Board's decisions may be appealed to the Board of Directors of the Riksbank. Authorized banks and some other authorized agencies implement the exchange control regulations. All current payments are exempt from exchange control, provided that they are made through the intermediary of an authorized bank in accordance with the currency prescrip- tions issued by the Riksbank. The authorized banks have 1 In view of a change that took place on January 1, 1974 (see the note at the end of this survey), this survey presents the position on that date. 2 The Exchange Control Board has seven members. Four of them and their alternates are appointed by the Government; the other members and their alternates are appointed by the Board of Directors of the Sveriges Riksbank. 404 been granted general licenses giving them power to approve various payments that are still subject to exchange control. Import and export licenses, when required, are issued by the Board of Trade, except those for foodstuffs, which are issued by the National Agricultural Marketing Board, and those for gold and gold alloys, which are issued by the Riks- bank. Prescription of Currency Payments to and from foreign countries may be made in any foreign currency or in Swedish kronor through any Regu- lar Account (see section on Nonresident Accounts, below). Nonresident Accounts There are two main types of nonresident accounts held in Swedish kronor with authorized banks in Sweden: Regular Accounts and Restricted Accounts. Other nonresident ac- counts are Foreign Exchange Accounts and Kronor Ac- counts for Nonresidents domiciled in Sweden. Regular Accounts may be held by residents of all countries. These accounts may be credited with transfers from other Regular Accounts, with authorized payments to foreign countries by residents of Sweden, and with sales of any for- eign currency. They may be debited for transfers to any other Regular Account and for authorized payments to residents of Sweden, and they may be exchanged into any foreign cur- rency. The crediting of Regular Accounts with proceeds from sales of foreign currencies or with transfers from other Regu- lar Accounts may not result in the creation of abnormal balances. Regular Accounts do not normally bear interest. The Riksbank is empowered to impose a negative interest charge on any excessive credit balances in Regular Accounts held by foreign banks or banking firms; at the end of 1973 this authority was not being invoked. Restricted Accounts are held mainly by persons who had been residents of Sweden but who became nonresidents after emigrating from that country. The accounts may be credited with interest accrued to, and earnings from, assets in Sweden, proceeds from sales of assets in Sweden owned by the account holders, and funds transferred from abroad. Balances in Re- stricted Accounts may be used for payments in Sweden for maintenance expenses of the account holder and his family; minor merchandise purchases; taxes and other official charges; expenses related to the administration and mainte- nance of the account holder's assets in Sweden; purchases of Swedish bonds denominated solely in Swedish kronor and of real estate; and gifts to, and the support of, persons domiciled in Sweden. Foreign Exchange Accounts* are held in foreign currencies. Such accounts may be credited with authorized payments in foreign currencies due to the account holder and with accrued interest. Balances on such accounts may be used for making authorized payments in foreign currencies to a resident. A 3 Residents may also ma in ta in Foreign Exchange Accounts in foreign currencies. Such accounts may be credited with authorized receipts in for- eign currencies and w i th interest and debited for authorized payments in foreign currencies. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Foreign Exchange Account may also be credited with trans- fers from abroad of foreign currencies, or transfers from Reg- ular Accounts or from other Foreign Exchange Accounts. A Foreign Exchange Account may be debited for transfers to any nonresident account. Balances on Foreign Exchange Ac- counts may be sold to an authorized bank against any other foreign currency or Swedish kroner. Kronor Accounts for Nonresidents domiciled in Sweden may be maintained by banks and centers of agricultural credit associations. These accounts may be credited with payments in Sweden in favor of an account holder and w i th accrued interest; they may be used for withdrawals in kroner in Swe- den. Imports and Import Payments All imports are prohibited when originating in or shipped from Rhodesia. With the main exception of a few agricultural and fishery products, practically all goods are free from quan- titative restriction and import licensing when imported from countries other than (1) Japan and (2) Albania, Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Ger- many, Hungary, North Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, the U.S.S.R., and North Viet-Nam. Most imports from countries in the second group are also liberalized. Some im- ports from Japan require licenses; these are in principle issued freely, except for a few specified commodities. Imports from certain countries of specified textiles and clothing are subject to specific licensing arrangements. Technically, the excep- tions to the liberalization regime are governed by "negative" lists. Imports not covered by the liberalization measures re- quire individual licenses, some of which are granted in accor- dance with bilateral trade arrangements. Payments for imports, including normal advance pay- ments, may, as current payments, be made without permis- sion through authorized banks and without the formality of presenting an import license. If the conditions specified for current payments (see section on Payments for Invisibles, below) are not met, an exchange control permit is required. Importers are permitted to utilize foreign commercial credits, provided that these do not exceed what is regarded as custom- ary in the trade. Payments for Invisibles The exchange control regulations define and list those cate- gories of payments abroad which are considered as current payments. Persons domiciled in Sweden may make such pay- ments without restriction in favor of persons domiciled abroad. The payments must be made through authorized banks in order to ensure that capital payments are not made in the guise of current payments. Payments not exceeding the equivalent of SKr 100 that are made abroad for any purpose do not have to be verified by authorized banks. Life insurance premiums in excess of SKr 1,000 a person a calendar year require the approval of the Riksbank; such approval is nor- mally given freely in respect of both existing and new insur- ance policies. SWEDEN For tourism, recreational travel, or study abroad, residents may acquire and take out freely up to SKr 6,000 a trip in Swedish and foreign banknotes and coins and other means of payment; applications for additional amounts must be sub- mitted to the Riksbank and are given liberal treatment. Au- thorized banks and other authorized agencies may allocate to residents, without restriction, exchange for business travel abroad. Nonresidents leaving Sweden may export freely Swedish and foreign banknotes and other means of payment which they brought into, or duly acquired in, the country. No trav- eler may, however, without specific permission take out of Sweden more than SKr 6,000 in Swedish banknotes and coins. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports except ships, scrap metals, and arms are ex- empt from license if payment is to be received in conformity w i th the general regulations (see section on Prescription of Currency, above); however, all exports to Rhodesia are pro- hibited. Proceeds from exports of goods do not have to be surrendered; they may be kept in a foreign currency account with a Swedish authorized bank and used by the holder to make authorized payments abroad, or they may be sold to an authorized bank against Swedish kronor. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles are subject to the same treatment as those from exports (see section on Exports and Export Proceeds, above). Each person entering Sweden may bring in up to SKr 6,000 in Swedish banknotes and coins, and unlimited amounts of other means of payment. Capital Direct investment abroad by Swedish residents requires individual authorization, which for industrialized countries normally is granted only if the investment is regarded as of benefit to the Swedish foreign exchange position and which, if the amount involved is exceptionally large, may be condi- tional on a substantial part being financed abroad at long term. Applications for direct investment in developing countries are treated more liberally. Residents may, on appli- cation, transfer capital abroad to purchase, for recreational purposes, real estate valued at no more than SKr 40,000 for each family, subject to certain limitations regarding the cost of a lot and the time allowed for building on it; amounts up to SKr 75,000 may be approved where a recreational need is clearly established. A Swedish resident when emigrating is, subject to veri- fication by the Riksbank, permitted to transfer up to SKr 100,000; after one calendar year (beyond the year of emigration), he will normally be permitted to transfer the remainder of his assets. When Swedish residents emigrate to engage abroad in activities of limited duration, applications for transfers in excess of the initial SKr 100,000 are consid- ered in a restrictive manner. Transfers on account of inheri- 405 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SWEDEN tances that are due to nonresidents are permitted. Authorized banks may freely approve payments abroad in respect of various categories of remittances, including those in respect of gifts and support payments, up to SKr 1,000 for each transfer. Residents are permitted to accept capital receipts from abroad on account of life, pension, and annu i ty contracts; contractual amortization of their investments; the sale of for- eign securities, real estate abroad, and personal property held by them abroad; and gifts and inheritances. Residents may accept other kinds of capital receipts from abroad only upon approval from the Riksbank. Residents who wish to receive loans or credits other than normal suppliers' credit from nonresidents must receive au- thorization to do so; each case is considered on its merits. Long-term borrowing abroad is under certain conditions per- mitted (for periods of at least ten years) to facilitate the financing of industrial investment in Sweden; otherwise bor- rowing to finance economic activity in Sweden is not, in principle, authorized. The Riksbank permits exporters, how- ever, to cover their normal suppliers' credits through foreign borrowing. Suppliers' credit granted by Swedish shipyards may be refinanced abroad even if it serves to finance sales of ships to Swedish shipowners. Swedish importers can be also granted permission to take up credit abroad to finance con- templated imports. Borrowing by way of suppliers' credit is not controlled, and other borrowing to finance imports is approved where the borrowing itself and the repayment terms are in conformity w i th commercial practice in the trade con- cerned. In this context, authorized banks are upon applica- tion permitted to extend to the foreign counterpart of a Swedish exporter or importer credit intended to finance cer- tain specified import and export transactions, and to refi- nance such credit through a corresponding foreign borrowing. Permission for the financing of the export and import transactions mentioned above requires that the credits conform to normal commercial practice. Authorized banks may under certain conditions be granted permission to borrow abroad at long term in amounts of normally at least SKr 10 million for purposes of on-lending to resident firms to finance import, export, or transit trade transactions; services performed abroad, such as civil engi- neering projects; the building of ships in Swedish yards for Swedish or foreign shipowners; the building of ships in for- eign yards for Swedish shipowners; Swedish direct investment abroad; or industrial investment by residents in Sweden. Foreign-owned companies in Sweden usually are permitted to borrow at medium term and long term from the parent companies. Generally, the repayment of foreign credits at any date other than specified in the contract requires a new autho- rization from the Riksbank. Permission is needed for the issuance of bonds and shares in Sweden by nonresidents; bond issues in favor of other Scandinavian countries and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development have been admitted when the state of the Swedish capital market and the balance of payments were considered to allow them. Foreign direct investments in Sweden require authoriza- tion, which normally is given. The transfer of the liquidation 406 proceeds of such investments, including appreciation, require authorization, which is always given. Investment by nonresi- dents in Swedish real estate requires approval according to regulations other than exchange control regulations. Residents do not need authorization to sell portfolio hold- ings of foreign securities to nonresidents. The purchase of listed, as well as unlisted, foreign securities by residents from nonresidents, requires authorization. As a rule, such authori- zation is not granted. However, authorized banks and stock- brokers may by virtue of a general license purchase from nonresidents, on behalf of residents, listed foreign securities and listed Swedish securities denominated in foreign curren- cies with the proceeds from sales to nonresidents of Swed- ish-held securities denominated in foreign currencies, provided that the purchase does not include certificates or shares issued by investment companies or investment funds (mutual funds) and is made within six months of the corre- sponding sale. Residents may without authorization buy for- eign securities and Swedish securities denominated in foreign currencies from other residents. Subject to individual license, the repurchase abroad is per- mitted of listed Swedish securities expressed in Swedish kro- nor, provided that an affidavit can be produced showing either (1) that at no time since January 1, 1959 have the securities been owned by a person domiciled in Sweden, or (2) that the securities have been acquired with the permission of the Swedish exchange authorities from a person domiciled in Sweden. The authorized banks and stockbrokers may, by v ir tue of a general license, handle purchases by nonresidents of listed Swedish securities expressed in Swedish kronor when payment is to be made in the form of other similar securities (switches), provided that (1) the foreign seller and buyer is the same person in each case; (2) the afore-mentioned affidavit requirements are met; (3) foreign holdings of bonds are not exchanged for shares; (4) not more than two weeks pass between the date of the purchase from and the date of the sale to the foreign party. The export of securities owned by non- residents other than Swedish emigrants is not restricted. Ceilings are placed on the net foreign exchange holdings of each authorized bank and the types of assets have been listed which the banks may hold w i th in their foreign exchange lim- its. The ceilings for commercial banks have been fixed so as to enable them to carry out their foreign business. Banks may grant only normal overdrafts to nonresidents. They may in- cur foreign exchange liabilities, but may not maintain a net liability in any one currency. This, together with the permis- sion to pay interest on foreign exchange deposits held by nonresidents, enables the banks to borrow foreign currency from nonresidents for on-lending (but not in the form of kronor) to foreign banks. Swedish banks may not borrow abroad freely in order to sell the proceeds against Swedish kronor in the market, but they may under certain conditions be granted permission to borrow abroad to relend in Sweden (see above). Nonresidents' holdings of kronor in Regular Accounts must not be "abnormal," and an interbank arrange- ment provides that they cannot earn interest. The credit bal- ances of foreign banks or banking firms in Regular Accounts held as of March 20, 1973 must not exceed the average net credit balance during January 1973. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Gold Gold in any form may be held, purchased, and sold within Sweden. Imports and exports of gold and gold alloys require licenses issued by the Riksbank; the types of gold affected are unmanufactured gold, most types of semimanufactured gold, and gold coins (except coins imported by or on behalf of collectors or collections). Import licenses are normally granted to jewelers, dental laboratories, and users of gold for industrial and scientific purposes, as well as to persons and firms importing for resale to these categories of users. As a general rule, no licenses are issued for the import of gold to be held on private account. Commercial imports and exports of articles containing gold, such as jewelry, may be made freely without a license. The same applies to imports and exports of gold coins of numismatic value and intended for collectors or collections. Changes during 1973 January 1. The industrial free trade agreement with the EEC came into effect. February 12. The exchange market was closed. It reopened on February 15. February 15. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the central rate was changed from SKr 4.81290 = US$1 to SKr 4.56 = US$1. Sweden contin- ued to avail itself of wider margins. New official limits for the U.S. dollar were set at SKr 4.4575 buying and SKr 4.6625 selling, respectively, per US$1. March 2. The exchange market was closed. It reopened on March 19. March 19. Sweden henceforth maintained a max imum mar- gin of 2% per cent for rates in spot exchange transactions in the official market between the Swedish krona and the Bel- gian franc, the Danish krone, the deutsche mark, the French franc, the Luxembourg franc, the Netherlands guilder, and the Norwegian krone. No announced margins would be ob- served for other currencies. The official limits for the U.S. dollar were revoked. March 20. Foreign banks and banking firms holding Regu- lar Accounts were requested to dispose, by March 26, 1973, of any holdings of kroner on such accounts in excess of normal credit balances, either through authorized payments to residents or through purchases of foreign currency. The normal balance was defined as the average net credit balance in the account during January 1973. In cases of noncompli- ance, the Riksbank reserved the right to prescribe that nega- tive interest, calculated on a daily basis as from March 20, 1973, should be levied on excess balances. No new Regular Accounts in the name of foreign banks or banking firms could be opened. Spot transactions of Swedish banks in foreign currency against Swedish kroner henceforth could only be concluded with two days1 value date in dealing with foreign banks. Transactions for shorter periods, such as one-day swaps, were not permitted unless authorized by the Riksbank in each case. In spot transactions with nonresidents Swedish banks could buy foreign currency against Swedish kronor only to SWEDEN the credit of a Swedish kronor account maintained by the nonresident w i th the Swedish bank concluding the transac- tion. When buying foreign currency from Swedish banks, the Riksbank would deposit 10 per cent of the kronor proceeds in a noninterest-bearing account, for a period to be decided by the Riksbank but not exceeding six months. Two of these measures were revoked on June 26 (see be- low). May 15. Applications for foreign exchange for emigration purposes had to be supported by a tax certificate issued by the County Administration concerned. May 18. An amendment (which partially took effect on March 20) to the Exchange Control Decree delegated to the Riksbank the power to prescribe that any charges imposed under the exchange control regulations accrue to the Riks- bank. May 24. The 1916 law governing foreign investment in Swedish real estate, mines, and shares of companies own- ing real property was amended. The Government was em- powered to prohibit a company from changing or remov- ing its "foreigner clause" limiting the participation of foreign physical or juridical persons in equity capital and voting rights. While previously it had been the practice for the King-in-Council to permit the removal or modification of a "foreigner clause" if the company concerned did not own important real property, the King-in-Council henceforth was required to take into consideration whether the proposed purchase was imcompatible with essential national interests. The specific criterion regarding the possession of real prop- erty became less important. Furthermore, the Government could prohibit the acquisition of foreign companies by Swed- ish firms through a transfer of their own shares. June 26. The measures of March 20, 1973 regarding new Regular Accounts in the name of foreign banks or banking firms and regarding the deposit in a noninterest-bearing ac- count of 10 per cent of the kronor proceeds of foreign cur- rency bought by the Riksbank from Swedish banks, were revoked. August 1. Additional imports were liberalized when origi- nating in Albania, Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, North Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, the U.S.S.R., and North Viet-Nam. November 20. The Riksbank announced that authorized banks could be granted permission, on a case-by-case basis, to borrow abroad at long term for purposes of on-lending to resident firms, provided the latter had received exchange con- trol permission to borrow abroad and the borrowing covered loans of normally at least SKr 10 million intended to finance imports (excluding normal suppliers' credits, for which per- mission was not required), exports, and transit trade; services performed abroad, such as civil engineering projects; the building of ships in Swedish yards for Swedish or foreign owners; the building of ships in foreign yards for Swedish shipowners; Swedish direct investment abroad; or industrial investment in Sweden. December 31. The privately concluded compensation agreement with Eastern Germany expired. 407 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SWEDEN NOTE.—The following change took place early in 1974: January 1. Most settlements with Eastern Germany hence- forth took place in convertible currencies; from July 1, 1974 this would apply to all settlements. Exports to Eastern Ger- many ceased to require licenses and most imports from East- ern Germany were liberalized. 408 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Exchange Rate System Prescription of Currency SWITZERLAND 1 The gold content of the Swiss Franc as established by Decree of the Federal Council on May 9, 1971 is 47/216 ( = 0.21759) gram of f ine gold. The central rate for the U.S. dollar fixed on December 20, 1971 was Sw F 3.84 = US$1. The gold parity of the Swiss franc has not been altered accordingly. On January 23, 1973 the Swiss National Bank suspended until fu r ther notice its intervention in the exchange market and no announced margins are maintained in the market for any currency. Since then, the exchange rate of the Swiss franc has been floating. The market rate for the U.S. dollar on Decem- ber 29, 1973 was Sw F 3.24 per US$1. Exchange is controlled in respect of transactions with five countries w i th which Switzerland has bilateral agreements or in respect of which Switzerland has enacted autonomous reg- ulations. Bilateral agreements cover Switzerland's payments w i th four countries or monetary areas; 2 Switzerland also controls its payments with Eastern Germany, including East Berlin. Official rates are applied to transactions covered by some of these arrangements. This domain of regulated settle- ments is known as the sector of controlled payments. All settlements outside this sector (including those w i th all other countries), as well as certain settlements involving Egyptian pounds which represent compensation for nationalization of Swiss property in Egypt, may be made freely at free market rates. Foreign banknotes are negotiated freely in Switzerland at rates determined by the interplay of supply and demand. Exchange Control Territory For all purposes of import, export, and the application of controlled payments, the Principality of Liechtenstein is in- cluded in the Swiss customs territory for the duration of the treaty of March 29, 1923 between Switzerland and the Princi- pality of Liechtenstein concerning the union of the Principal- ity of Liechtenstein with the Swiss customs territory. For purposes of capital control, physical or juridical persons (in- cluding banks) who are domiciled in the Principality of Liech- tenstein are generally considered by Switzerland as residents, except in respect of the acquisition of Swiss real estate. For purposes of the Federal Law on Banks and Savings Ins t i tu- tions, however, Liechtenstein is considered a foreign coun try. Administration of Control The au thor i ty to impose measures for the control of im- ports, exports, and payments is vested in the Swiss Federal Council acting, as a rule, on the proposals of the Federal Department of Public Economy or the Federal Political De- partment. The Swiss National Bank is the executive au thor i ty in matters of currency, and the Swiss Compensation Office, together with the authorized banks, is entrusted with the operation of controlled payments. 1 Switzerland is not a member of the In terna t ional Monetary Fund. 2 Hungary and, for certain specific payments on ly, Cuba, Egypt, and Turkey. However, the clearing arrangements with Hungary expired on December 31, 1973, af ter wh ich settlements took place in convertible currencies. The currency and manner of settlement on account of mer- chandise transactions and invisibles in the sector of con- trolled payments are prescribed in accordance with the provisions of the relevant payments agreements and /or by the Swiss regulations. Settlements with countries in this sec- tor are made in Swiss francs; however, certain settlements w i th Egypt may be made in Egyptian pounds through special accounts maintained by the Swiss Compensation Office at the Central Bank of Egypt, and certain settlements with Cuba must be made in Swiss francs to the debit or credit of a special account at the Swiss National Bank. Outside the sector of controlled payments, certain settlements with Turkey are subject to special regulations. In all other cases, settlements are not subject to regulations involving prescription of cur- rency. Nonresident Accounts Nonresident accounts related to the sector of controlled payments may be grouped as follows: (1) accounts related to Cuba and Hungary, which are centralized with the Swiss National Bank, and (2) the "decentralized" accounts, com- prising those which may be held with the Swiss National Bank and with authorized banks in Switzerland. The ac- counts of the second group are of two kinds: the accounts of Eastern Germany, which are transferable only to other ac- counts of the same nationality, and the accounts of Egypt, which are subject to special treatment. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Rhodesia require a license; licenses are not granted in excess of the average volume of imports for 1964, 1965, and 1966. With a few exceptions, imports into Switzerland from other countries may be made freely. The only commodities subject to license irrespective of their origin are certain agricultural products. Import permits for goods still under license are, in general, granted freely, but global quotas are established for certain agricultural products. Im- ports of textiles from specified countries are subject to price surveillance or price certification. Settlements are made automatically for authorized imports from countries to which the Swiss control regulations are applicable, i.e., the sector of controlled payments. Payments for imports from all other countries may be made freely through the free market. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles may be made freely; however, pay- ments to Eastern Germany (including East Berlin) and countries with which Switzerland has bilateral payments agreements are controlled. 3 The export of Swiss and foreign banknotes is free. 3 Payments to Cuba are controlled only insofar as they relate to the Cuban-Swiss agreement on indemnification for nationalized property. 409 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SWITZERLAND Exports and Export Proceeds The export (including re-export) of some goods is subject to export control through individual licenses. This export licensing system is operated in part with the assistance of appropriate trade organizations. Export proceeds received through the sector of controlled payments are converted into Swiss currency in observance of the existing regulations. Other export proceeds are freely disposable. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles received through the sector of controlled payments are converted into Swiss francs in obser- vance of the existing regulations. Proceeds received in con- vertible currencies are freely disposable. The import of Swiss and foreign banknotes is free. Capital Transfers of capital from countries in the sector of con- trolled payments require licenses if they are made through the sector of controlled payments; transfers of capital to such countries do not require licenses. Transfers of capital to other countries may be made freely, with the exception mainly that bank credits and other bank lending to nonresidents, when exceeding Sw F 10 million each and w i th a maturity of 12 months or more, require permission. This applies, inter alia, to foreign issues in Switzerland of bonds and to direct partici- pations by Swiss banks in Euro-bond issues. Furthermore, all proposed first placings of medium-term negotiable paper (notes, certificates of deposit, etc.) in amounts of Sw F 3 million or more must be submitted to the National Bank for examination. In addition, issues in Switzerland of domestic bonds as well as foreign bonds denominated in Swiss francs are subject to ceilings. 4 All capital exports denominated in Swiss francs and licensed by the National Bank (bond issues, placing of notes, and other loans and credits, except export credit) must upon approval (or, where appropriate, as soon as the subscription lists are closed) be converted into foreign currency at Swiss banks; at times a prescribed m in imum por- tion of this conversion must take place at the National Bank. 5 Banks participating in new issues of Swiss franc bonds or notes by nonresidents must place at least 65 per cent of the total amount of each issue with resident customers, 6 and they may not sell the notes to nonresident banks. Issues by foreign issuers of debt instruments expressed in Swiss francs and having a ma tu r i ty of less than 12 months are 4 On January 30, 1974, the ceiling on new issues of foreign Swiss f ranc bonds was reduced from Sw F 160 million a mon th to Sw F 240 million for February and March combined, the amount for the f i rst quarter of 1974 being set at Sw F 360 million, and that on individual issues from Sw F 80 million to Sw F 60 million. Private placements in the first quarter of 1974 of medium-term notes by nonresidents were to be reduced by 25 per cent from one fou r th of the level for all of 1974, i.e., to Sw F 650 million, and the amount of individual transactions was limited to Sw F 100 million. Overall lending to nonresidents of types subject to authorization (other than export credits) was to be reduced from 1973 levels in the same manner, and individual transactions were limited to Sw F 100 million. 5 These conversion requirements were suspended on February 1, 1974. 8 For the application of this regulation, Liechtenstein is considered a foreign coun try, since the regulation is based on the Law on Banks and Savings Ins t i tu t ions, which does not extend to banks in Liechtenstein. The regulation was suspended with effect from February 1, 1974 for bond issues but not for issues of notes. 410 discouraged. Inward capital transfers are restricted.7 Some of the rele- vant regulations make a distinction between alien nonresi- dents and nonresidents of Swiss nationality, the latter usually being exempt from prohibitions or approval requirements even when they have their permanent residence abroad. Phys- ical or juridical persons having their domicile or registered office in Liechtenstein are considered nonresidents for pur- poses of the acquisition of Swiss real estate. The definition of the terms foreigner" and "foreign funds" is not the same under all types of capital control regulations. All juridical acts aiming at the acquisition of real estate situated in Switzerland by physical or juridical persons resi- dent abroad (including those resident in Liechtenstein) are prohibited. Banks and other financial intermediaries must abstain from investing foreign funds in Swiss securities, foreign securities denominated in Swiss francs, and mortgages on Swiss real estate, although nonresidents selling Swiss securities in Swit- zerland or obtaining the redemption proceeds of Swiss securi- ties are permitted to reinvest the proceeds (whether these accrue to themselves or other nonresidents) in Swiss securities within a month of receipt, provided this offsetting takes place within the "investment quota" of the bank or securities deal- er's office where the proceeds are received. The physical im- portation of Swiss and foreign securities is unrestricted. The National Bank may approve the acquisition of Swiss assets by a nonresident when they would serve to create or expand a business firm in Switzerland. 8 Borrowing from nonresidents, whether in domestic or for- eign currency, by resident physical and juridical persons other than banks requires the prior approval of the National Bank, which is not normally granted; the principal exemp- tions from this licensing requirement are for borrowing corre- sponding to customary credit terms for current commercial transactions and for credits up to Sw F 1 million, if taken up in foreign currency, used entirely abroad, and not converted in to Swiss francs. Banks are subject to reserve requirements against the growth and the level of external liabilities (liabilities both in Swiss francs and in foreign currencies), but they are not re- quired to maintain balanced foreign currency positions. Banks are not permitted to pay interest on Swiss franc depos- its received from nonresidents after July 31, 1971. There is a suspended requirement that they must charge a commission ("negative interest") of 2 per cent a calendar quarter, payable in advance, on all net increases after June 30, 1972 in nonresi- dent-held Swiss franc deposits, irrespective of ma tur i ty. Irrespective of the present restrictions on the acquisition of Swiss real estate, purchases of real estate to be used as prem- ises for commercial or industrial firms in Switzerland by or 7 W i th effect from February 1, 1974 the Federal Ordinances of June 26, 1972 on (1) the placement of foreign funds in Swiss securities and mortgages on Swiss real estate, and (2) the investment of foreign funds in Swiss real estate were revoked. The restrictions on borrowing abroad, imposed under a Federal Ordinance of Ju ly 5, 1972, remained in force, as did the prohibition on the payment of interest on foreign funds. Also on February 1, 1974, a new law regulating the acquisition of Swiss real estate by foreigners came in to force. The responsibility for au thor iz ing the investment of foreign funds in Swiss real estate was transferred to the cantons, subject to the right of appeal to the Federal Government by applicants. 8 The relevant decree was abolished on February 1, 1974. ©International Monetary Fund.

Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form at home or abroad; domestic transactions are not subject to any sales or turnover tax. There is a free gold market in Zurich. Imports and ex- ports of gold in any form by residents and nonresidents are unrestricted and free of license. No customs duties or other charges are levied on exports of gold. Imports of gold in certain forms are subject to customs du ty (bars and certain coins are exempt) or sales tax (coins and bars are exempt). Import and export licenses are required for commercial im- ports and exports of certain articles containing gold; these are issued freely. Changes during 1973 January 1. The industrial free trade agreement signed on July 22, 1972 between the EEC and Switzerland and Liech- tenstein came in to force. Quantitative restrictions on indus- trial imports from EEC member countries were abolished; the first reductions in import duties took place on April 1. January 1. The Federal Decree on Foreign Trade and Pay- ments Measures of June 28, 1972 came in to force. The decree revised the powers for the conclusion, revision, or termination of trade agreements and payments agreements. January 10. The Federal Council issued a Federal Ordi- nance for the implementation of the Federal Decree on Mea- sures in the Field of Credit and Banking of December 20, 1972 (which decree, among other things, empowered the Na- tional Bank to impose mandatory reserve requirements on the level as well as the growth of various types of bank liabilities and to impose ceilings on domestic bank credit). The Na- tional Bank was empowered to fix a ceiling for the global amount of public domestic bond and share issues of Sw F 5 million or more. Ceilings on the growth of domestic credit and on public issues of bonds by residents were imposed w i th effect from January 16 (see below). January 14. The Federal Council approved regulations im- plementing the Decree on War Materials, to come in to force on February 1, 1973. Prior authorization was required for the export of specified commodities. January 15. The prescribed partial conversion in to U.S. dollars at the National Bank for all capital exports subject to licensing was abolished. Since September 1, 1972 the mini- mum ratio had been 50 per cent for funds w i th a ma tu r i ty of less than five years and 60 per cent for funds w i th a ma tu r i ty of five years or more; since July 25, 1972 the rate at which the conversion had to take place had been Sw F 3.80 = US$1 or the market rate of exchange, whichever was higher. The requirement of immediate conversion in to foreign ex- change at Swiss banks remained in force. (On November 1, a requirement of partial conversion into U.S. dollars at the National Bank was reintroduced; see November 1, below.) SWITZERLAND January 15. The National Bank set the limit for foreign bond issues denominated in Swiss francs at three a mon th and imposed a ceiling of Sw F 80 million on each issue. January 16. The National Bank imposed a ceiling limiting the expansion of domestic bank credit until Ju ly 31, 1973 to 6 per cent over the level permitted on Ju ly 31, 1972. The National Bank also imposed a ceiling for 1973 of Sw F 3.4 billion on net public issues of bonds by residents; such issues had amounted to Sw F 4 billion (net) in 1972. January 17. The Federal Government established a Capital Issues Committee; this Committee's approval was required for all public domestic issues of shares and bonds. January 23. The National Bank suspended its intervention in the exchange market. As a result, the Swiss franc began to appreciate in terms of the U.S. dollar. The suspension was continued th roughout 1973 (and beyond), w i th the exception that the National Bank made certain spot and forward pur- chases of U.S. dollars between February 19 and February 23, 1973. The in terven t ion limits observed prior to January 23 were Sw F 3.7535 and Sw F 3.9265 per US$1. January 23. The obligation for banks to balance their for- eign currency position daily, which had been suspended on October 16, 1972, was reimposed, w i th effect from Janu- ary 29. (This measure was again suspended w i th effect from October 1, 1973; see September 22, below.) January 25. The Capital Issues Committee announced for the f irst time a ceiling on net domestic bond issues. The amount authorized was Sw F 485 m i l l ion for mid-February to end-March. February 5. The Federal Government introduced a bill calling for wider federal powers over the development of the economy. These were to be written in to the Constitution. February 20. The National Bank announced that it would make more stringent the rules governing payment of negative interest on increases in foreign-held bank deposits in Swiss francs (including "fiduciary" deposits). From March 1 the calculation basis became the highest daily balance in each mon th instead of the average balance in a calendar month. (This regulation was reversed on Ju ly 1, see below.) March 1. With effect from March 26, the National Bank modified the banks' m in imum reserve requirements against foreign liabilities. For foreign liabilities, the marginal reserve requirements were supplemented by reserve requirements on the level of external liabilities, and the new rules differentiated between Swiss franc and foreign currency liabilities. There was no change in the requirements against domestic liabili- ties, but all reserve requirements were extended to any bank with a balance sheet total of Sw F 20 million or more. Banks were no longer allowed to buy U.S. dollars from the National Bank with their m in imum reserves. Moreover, the countervalue of the U.S. dollars purchased in this manner du r ing the period when the gentleman's agreement of Au- gust 16, 1971 and the Federal Ordinance of July 5, 1972 were in force, could no longer be deducted from the required amount of minimum reserves. Banks could, however, deduct from the growth in foreign currency liabilities to nonresidents any increase in their foreign currency investments abroad. The minimum reserve ratios on the growth of foreign liabil- ities in either Swiss francs or foreign currency were set at 56 411 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SWITZERLAND per cent for demand or time deposits held by banks and on all demand deposits; 42 per cent on time deposits held by nonbanks and on "fiduciary" foreign funds invested in Swit- zerland; and 7 per cent on savings deposits. The level of foreign liabilities denominated in Swiss francs was subjected to reserve requirements of 3 per cent on time deposits held by banks and on all demand deposits; 2 per cent on time deposits held by nonbanks and on "fiduciary" foreign funds; and half of these ratios on foreign liabilities in foreign currency. March 21. The Federal Council adopted a law (Lex Fur- gler) to amend and replace the Federal Decree of June 26, 1972 regulating the acquisition of Swiss real estate by nonresi- dents. The en try into force was to be announced at a later date. (See December 23, below.) March 27. The minimum proportion of new Swiss franc bond and note issues by nonresidents that had to be allocated to residents was raised from 60 per cent to 65 per cent. April 15. The bilateral payments arrangements w i th Bul- garia expired. April 15. The bilateral payments arrangements with Roma- nia expired. April 16. The Sw F 1 million a year exemption from prior National Bank approval for borrowing abroad by nonbank residents was restricted to credits taken up in foreign cur- rency that were used entirely abroad and not converted into Swiss francs. For other borrowings, the exemption was re- duced from Sw F 1 million to Sw F 50,000 a debtor, and could be used only once instead of each calendar year. June 12. The Federal Council passed a law reducing the stamp du ty to 2 per mill for foreign obligations and 1 per mill for domestic obligations, and abolishing the stamp du ty on money market paper. The law would come into effect on July 1, 1974. July 1. The negative interest charge on nonresident ac- counts again was levied on the average balance in a calendar mon th. July 4. The National Bank amended w i th effect from Au- gust 1, 1973 its regulations concerning the limitation of bank credit and the imposition of minimum reserve requirements. Credits to physical and juridical persons domiciled or resi- dent in Liechtenstein would be considered domestic credits, and for purposes of the reserve requirements, their balances with Swiss banks would be considered domestic funds. July 4. A Federal Ordinance was issued which provided that, w i th effect from August 1, physical and juridical persons having their permanent address (domicile) or head office in Liechtenstein would generally be deemed to have Swiss na- tionality for the purposes of the Federal Ordinance of June 26, 1972 concerning the investment of foreign funds. Juridical persons, including companies with head offices in Liechten- stein, would be deemed to be of foreign nationality, however, when they were under the control of persons not having their permanent address (domicile) either in Liechtenstein or Swit- zerland and did not carry out any economic activities in either country, or when they were concerned solely with the acquisi- tion of assets or securities within the meaning of Article 4 of the Ordinance (see August 1, below). 412 July 24. It was announced that the Federal Government and the Swiss National Bank had agreed to extend the an- ti-inflationary emergency measures of December 20, 1972. The National Bank had decided to fix the permitted rate of credit growth during August 1, 1973-July 31, 1974 at 6 per cent of the level of domestic credit allowed as at July 31,1972. August L Measures came into effect in Liechtenstein adapt- ing the Principality's regulations concerning the money and capital markets to those in force in Switzerland. August 1. Liechtenstein ceased to be regarded as a foreign country, and residents of Liechtenstein generally ceased to be regarded as nonresidents, for purposes of the Swiss capital controls (including the application of the reserve require- ments against foreign funds), except in respect of the acquisi- tion of Swiss real estate and in respect of capital exports. September 22. The Federal Council empowered the Na- tional Bank to suspend the negative interest charge. With effect from October 1, the National Bank suspended until fur ther notice the charge of 2 per cent a quarter, payable in advance, levied on any increases on nonresident-held Swiss f ranc deposits over June 30, 1972 levels. Also with effect from October 1, the commercial banks ceased to be obliged to balance their foreign currency position daily. The National Bank reserved the right to reintroduce both measures when- ever necessary. The prohibition of interest payments on non- resident-held deposits in Swiss francs made after July 31, 1971 (with the exception of savings accounts of up to Sw F 50,000 a depositor) remained in force. November 1. With immediate effect, the National Bank directed the banks to convert 10 per cent of all capital exports subject to licensing into U.S. dollars at the National Bank, at the highest daily interbank selling rate. This applied to all capital export transactions denominated in Swiss francs and licensed by the National Bank, including both private place- ments and public issues. November 1. The National Bank reduced from three to two the number of foreign Swiss franc loans which could be issued on the Swiss capital market each month, the maximum amount of each issue being limited to Sw F 80 million. Private placements were not affected. November 1. Minimum reserve requirements on the level of banks' foreign liabilities on October 31, 1973 were increased across the board by 25 per cent; individual ratios were un- changed, but the extra 25 per cent was charged on the overall level of foreign liabilities, the average reserve requirement thus going up from 58 per cent to 72.5 per cent. A reserve requirement of 10 per cent was imposed, effective October 31, 1973, on the growth in resident-held time deposits in Swiss francs and foreign currency (with maturities from 48 hours to 1 year) over the level on March 31, 1972. November 8. The stamp du ty on Swiss bonds, on all foreign securities, and on bills of exchange was abolished with effect from July 1, 1974. December 2. The continuation until December 31, 1975 at the latest, of the anti-inflationary emergency measures in force since December 20, 1972, was approved in a national referendum. December 10. The National Bank announced it would lower minimum reserve requirements on the level of domestic ©International Monetary Fund.

(On January 4, 1974 the recall of the released reserves was postponed from Janu- ary 14 until February 4. On January 24, the recall was waived, and with effect from January 31 minimum reserves were re- duced by a fur ther 20 per cent.) December 15. The bilateral payments arrangements with Poland expired. December 23. The Federal Government decided that the law of March 21, 1973, which regulated the acquisition of real estate by nonresidents, would come into force on February 1, 1974. On that date the Federal Decree of June 26, 1972 prohibiting investment by nonresidents in Swiss real estate would be rescinded. The new law tightened the authorization procedure for the acquisitions of real estate by nonresidents. Purchases of real estate by foreigners who had not been resi- dent in Switzerland for a period of five consecutive years would be subject to approval by the canton concerned. Sales of real estate to foreigners in certain areas where a large proportion of the property was already foreign owned would be prohibited. December 31. The bilateral payments arrangements with Hungary expired. 413 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC Exchange Rate System On July 29, 1947, a par value for the Syrian Pound was established by the Syrian Arab Republic w i th the Fund. However, exchange transactions no longer take place at rates based on that par value. In principle there are two exchange markets, the commercial market and the financial market, but since July 18, 1973 the exchange rates have been unified at LS 3.75 buying and LS 3.80 selling, per US$1; l market rates for other currencies are quoted on the basis of these rates for the U.S. dollar and the market rates for the currencies con- cerned in international centers. In principle, the commercial market rate applies to all trade (and directly related services) and to receipts from oil pipeline royalties. All other transactions qua l i fy for the financial mar- ket. The Commercial Bank of Syria charges a commission of %0 of 1 per cent on sales or purchases of foreign exchange. Administration of Control Policy with regard to imports and exports is determined by the Government through the Ministry of Economy and For- eign Trade. Under an agreement between the Central Bank of Syria and the Administrative Committee of the Exchange Office, all transactions of the Exchange Office are carried out through the Central Bank. Import licenses are issued by the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade, and exchange li- censes for invisibles and capital transactions are issued by the Exchange Office. Authorized commercial banks deal in for- eign exchange both in the commercial and the financial mar- ket. They open letters of credit or accept bills for collection only with the prior approval of the Exchange Office. At pres- ent there is only one authorized bank, the Commercial Bank of Syria, which has been authorized by the Exchange Office to open letters of credit and accept bills for collection without prior approval, provided that certain conditions are fu l f i l led. Prescription of Currency The Exchange Office is empowered to prescribe the curren- cies to be obtained for exports. The current requirement is that proceeds of exports to all countries except those w i th which the Syrian Arab Republic has bilateral payments agreements 2 be obtained in the currency of the coun try to which the goods are exported if it is an "acceptable" cur- rency, 3 or in any other convertible currency, at the export- er's choice. Proceeds from exports to certain neighboring countries may be obtained in banknotes issued by the coun try concerned; these countries are Cyprus, the Gulf states, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the Yemen Arab Republic, and the People's Democratic Repub- 1 W i th effect from Janua ry 9, 1974 the buy ing and selling rates were changed to LS 3.85 and LS 3.90, respectively, per US$1. 2 Bulgaria, People's Republic of China, Eastern Germany, Egyp t, Hunga ry, Nor th Korea, Poland, Romania, Sri Lanka, U.S.S.R., and No r th Viet-Nam. 3 "Acceptable" currencies are those for which the Exchange Office quotes rates: Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche ma rk, French francs, Iraqi dinars, Italian lire, Jordan dinars, Lebanese pounds, Ne ther lands guilders, pounds sterling, Saudi Arabian riyals, Swedish k rone r, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. 414 lie of Yemen. Prescription of currency requirements are not applied to outgoing payments. All payments to Israel, Rho- desia, and South Africa are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts Nonresident accounts in Syrian pounds may be held by nonresidents 4 and may be credited with the proceeds of for- eign currencies sold to the authorized bank and with pay- ments for goods. They may be debited to pay for Syrian exports to the country of the account holder or, with the prior approval of the Exchange Office, to other countries, and for expenses in the Syrian Arab Republic. Transfers abroad from these accounts require the prior approval of the Exchange Office, which is granted freely. Residents and nonresidents may also keep accounts in foreign currencies in the Syrian Arab Republic, but only if these accounts result from an inf low of capital; transfers abroad from these accounts are made freely. Temporary resident accounts may be opened in the name of nonresidents temporarily resident in the Syrian Arab Republic. Permitted credits include the local currency proceeds of foreign currency brought in through the financial market and amounts corresponding to import payments that are not transferred. Debits for local expenditures are com- pletely free, and debits for certain expenditures abroad also are permitted. Imports and Import Payments Imports of commodities originating in Israel, Rhodesia, or South Africa are prohibited. Many basic commodities (in- cluding green coffee, tea, rice, tobacco, salt, paper, iron and steel, and agricultural machinery) are imported only by state t rad ing agencies (including the successor organizations to SIMEX, particularly the General Organization for Trade and Artisan Products —GOTA) or, for their own account, by certain other official agencies. Imports of some other com- modities are reserved for 4 tunions of industries." Imports are divided in to three main categories: (1) imports prohibited by decree and specified in a Prohibited List, which comprises mostly goods that are produced domestically, including some textile products; (2) imports on a Suspended List, which com- prises some less essential goods which are temporarily not admitted either for balance of payments reasons or for protec- tive reasons; and (3) all imports not included in the above two lists. Certain suspended imports may be acquired in pay- ments agreement countries th rough compensation transac- tions invo lv ing the export of Syrian industrial or mineral products. V i r tua l ly all imports must be made direct from the coun try of origin, w i thout the intermediary of any firm con- ducting a business established outside the Syrian Arab Re- public; the M in is try of Economy and Foreign Trade has the au tho r i ty, however, to permit certain goods to be imported from countries other than the country of origin.

Not for Redistribution imported from the Federal Republic of Germany, the United Kingdom, or the United States unless it is shown that the price is lower and the quality higher than that of comparable products offered by other suppliers. All permitted imports, except those made by state trading agencies, require individual import licenses before the placing of orders. The state trading agencies may conclude import transactions and have the goods shipped before an import license is granted; the license must be obtained, however, before customs clearance. Goods included in the Suspended List may be imported only under certain conditions of domes- tic need, under special individual license from the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade, and with the prior approval of the Ministry of Indus try or the Ministry of Supply. Certain imports (not on the Suspended or Prohibited List) from Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia are not subject to license, in accordance with the Arab Common Market Agreement or the bilateral agreements of the Syrian Arab Republic with some of these countries. These imports include all agricultural commodities, livestock, and some in- dustrial products. Syrian citizens, whether resident in the Syrian Arab Repub- lic or abroad, are entitled to import specified raw materials, capital goods, consumer goods, and spare parts, provided that imports are paid for with their own foreign exchange held abroad; to obtain import licenses, which cannot exceed the value of LS 100,000 (except for capital goods), the im- porter must provide evidence of his foreign exchange holdings abroad on December 31, 1970. Import licenses are granted freely to importers who have obtained foreign suppliers' credit of at least 365 days. Licenses to import specified con- sumer goods, raw materials, and semifinished goods, up to a value of LS 12,000 for a six-month period, are freely granted to traders and industrialists whose activity is certified by the Chamber of Commerce or by the Chamber of Indus try. Im- ports by parcel post of any goods that are neither prohibited nor suspended are permitted without a license, provided that each parcel is valued at LS 250 or less. There is a tax of 2 per cent on the issue of import licenses, except for government imports and imports of certain essen- tial items, including raw materials, petroleum, and petroleum products. In addition, there are the following taxes on im- ports which are collected by the customs: (1) a statistical tax of 4 per cent; (2) a consumption tax of 4 per cent for all imports for which the tariff rate is more than 1 per cent; (3) a defense tax of 10 per cent of the tariff; (4) a school tax of 10 per cent of the consumption tax plus 2 per cent of the tariff; (5) a harbor tax of 3 per cent of the tariff for goods transferred by ships through Syrian harbors (most commodities can be imported only through Syrian harbors); and (6) an ocean tax of ^10 of 1 per cent of the value of imports for all goods transferred by ship in any harbor, including those of neigh- boring countries. Payments for imports may be made by letters of credit, time drafts, or bills for collection, or by crediting a nonresi- dent account or a temporary resident account. However, im- porters are not granted foreign exchange if they postpone the transfer until more than a week after the due date of the bill or draf t. The importer submits to the Commercial Bank of SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC Syria the import license and the pro forma invoice. The Com- mercial Bank of Syria then opens the letters of credit or accepts the bills for collection. Approval by the Exchange Office is currently not required. Certain delays may occur in the provision of foreign exchange for imports on a collection basis. Payments for Invisibles The insurance for imports under documentary credit must be effected locally. All payments for invisibles, except those directly related to trade transactions, must be made through the financial market. Residents traveling abroad may take with them foreign exchange purchased at the financial market rate as follows: for travel to Lebanon, the equivalent of LS 100 a trip; for travel to Jordan, LS 250 a trip; for travel to other Arab countries (except Algeria, the Libyan Arab Republic, Mo- rocco, the Sudan, and Tunisia) and to Cyprus and Turkey, LS 500 a trip; and for travel to other countries (including Algeria, the Libyan Arab Republic, Morocco, the Sudan, and Tunisia), the equivalent of LS 1,250 a trip. For children under ten years of age, the allowances are 50 per cent of these amounts. For travel to payments agreement countries 50 per cent of the travel allocation must be taken up through the clearing account concerned. Travelers to Iraq, Jordan, and other countries of the Arab Common Market may, instead of taking up the above-mentioned travel allocations in foreign currency, export Syrian currency up to the amount of the allowance to which they are entitled. On departure, residents of Syrian nationality must pay an exit tax of LS 11.50 a person. Fixed allocations at the financial market rate also exist for other invisibles, as follows: 60 per cent of the salaries received by foreign technicians and experts employed in the Syrian Arab Republic; 50 per cent of the salaries of personnel of foreign diplomatic and international missions in the Syrian Arab Republic; up to LS 3,000 a stockholder a year for dividends accruing to nonresidents from Syrian securities; and LS 250 a person a mon th for private donations and charities. In all cases, applications for additional amounts must be submitted for approval to the Exchange Office. Nonresidents leaving the country are permitted to take out foreign exchange and Syrian currency within the limit of the declaration they have made when entering the Syrian Arab Republic; the amount of Syrian currency taken out may not exceed LS 100. For additional amounts, the approval of the Exchange Office is required. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of wheat, cotton, cottonseed, barley, and their derivatives are nationalized and are made by the Cereals Of- fice or the Cotton Au thor i ty. Exports of certain other com- modities are also reserved for government agencies, state trading agencies, or specified companies. Exports of a few goods to any country and all exports to Israel, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. Exports of crude petroleum and petroleum products to the Netherlands and the United States are suspended. Exports of the main export products and of all goods of foreign origin require licenses. For all other ex- 415 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC ports, licenses are not required. For all private exports, how- ever, a repatriation commitment must be executed in which the exporter undertakes to bring the proceeds to the Syrian Arab Republic and surrender them to the Commercial Bank of Syria within six mon ths after the date of export. The pro- ceeds of exports must be surrendered to the Exchange Office at the commercial market buying rate. Certain manufactured exports receive subsidies from the Fund for the Development of Exports of Industrial Products. Exports of cotton are subject to an export tax of 12% per cent ad valorem. All exports of agricultural products (includ- ing cotton) are subject to an ad valorem agricultural tax of 10 per cent. All the above taxes are collected by the customs. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles directly related to trade transac- tions and those from pipeline royalties must be sold in the commercial market. All other proceeds from invisibles must be sold in the financial market. Nonresidents entering the Syrian Arab Republic are permitted to bring in un l im i ted foreign exchange in any form, provided that they present a written statement of the amount upon en try; this statement is required only when the traveler intends to take out the foreign exchange he brought in. Nonresidents are permitted to bring in not more than LS 100 in Syrian currency. Capital All inward and outward capital transfers take place through the financial market. Imports of capital in the form of foreign exchange are free for private individuals, whether residents or nonresidents. The export of capital requires the approval of the Exchange Office. Special facilities for invest- ment of Arab capital in the Syrian Arab Republic are pro- vided by Legislative Decree No. 348 of December 29, 1969. Other facilities permitting residents and nonresidents of any na t iona l i ty to open foreign currency accounts in the Syrian Arab Republic w i th imported funds are based on Decree No. 779 of April 1, 1970 and Order No. 191 of April 23, 1970. Neither type of facility is applicable to funds received over clearing accounts or by diplomatic and UN missions and their staffs. Gold Residents may hold, acquire, and sell gold in the Syrian Arab Republic w i thout restriction. The domestic negotiation of gold takes place at free market prices that are in line with free market prices abroad. Imports and exports of gold are free from import or export licensing. Import payments, how- ever, require the approval of the Exchange Office, which is granted only for imports for industrial use or for re-export. Export proceeds are subject to surrender. Changes during 1973 January 1. Some additional types of exchange transactions were shifted from the official to the parallel market. As a result, only receipts from exports of cotton and crude petro- leum and from oil pipeline royalties continued to be settled in the official exchange market. January 6. The bilateral payments agreement with Cuba was terminated. February 18. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the authorities changed the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar in the parallel market from LS 4.30 buying and LS 4.32 selling to LS 4.00 buying and LS 4.05 selling, per US$1. In the official market the selling rate was changed from LS 3.82 to LS 3.85 per US$1, while the buy ing rate was maintained unchanged at LS 3.80 per US$1. April 9. The bilateral payments agreement with Spain was formally terminated. May 21. Operations in the parallel market were reorga- nized. A commercial market was established for all trade transactions and directly related services. The commercial rates were fixed at LS 4.00 buying and LS 4.05 selling, per US$1. Other transactions formerly transacted in the parallel market henceforth took place in a financial market at rates following the fluctuating rate for the U.S. dollar in interna- tional markets (mainly Beirut). A spread of LS 0.07 per US$1 was maintained between the rates in this market. The initial rates for the U.S. dollar in the financial market were about LS 3.85. The official market rates were maintained unchanged at LS 3.80 and LS 3.82 buying and selling. July 8. The remaining transactions in the official market (cotton and petroleum proceeds and pipeline royalties) were shifted to the commercial market and the rates in this market were appreciated to LS 3.60 and LS 3.65, buying and selling, per US$ 1. The spread in the financial market was reduced to LS 0.05 per US$1. July 18. The rates in the commercial and financial markets were unified at LS 3.75 buying and LS 3.80 selling, per US$1. October 17. Exports of crude oil to the United States and the Netherlands were suspended. 416 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TANZANIA Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.103133 gram of f ine gold per Tanzania Shilling, corresponding to T Sh 8.61675 = SDR 1. A central rate of T Sh 6.90000 = US$1 has been established, and Tanzania avails itself of wider margins. l The Bank of Tanza- nia deals with the Government and with authorized banks in Kenya and Uganda shillings (except Uganda banknotes) against Tanzania shillings at par. Administration of Control The Minister for Finance has delegated the administration of exchange control to the Bank of Tanzania. Au thor i ty for approving normal import payments, many payments in re- spect of current invisibles, and some capital payments is dele- gated by the Bank of Tanzania to the two authorized banks, the National Bank of Commerce and the People's Bank of Zanzibar. On the mainland, import control is administered by the Imports Controller in the Bank of Tanzania and export con- trol by the Exports Controller in the Ministry of Commerce and Industries. The responsibility for issuing specific import and export licenses rests with the Controllers, to whom appli- cations should be submitted by the importer or exporter in Tanzania before orders are placed abroad or exports are shipped. Import applications for commodities the importa- tion of which is confined to specified parastatal organizations must be submitted through the respective parastatal organi- zation. Zanzibar administers an independent system of for- eign trade controls; all imports and the principal exports are made by the state trading agencies (Bizanje and the Zanzibar State Trading Corporation). Prescription of Currency Tanzania has ceased to be a Scheduled Territory under the terms of the U.K. Exchange Control Act, 1947 but under current U.K. exchange control regulations continues to be regarded as a country of the Overseas Sterling Area. Pay- ments to residents of countries in the Sterling Area may be made in Tanzania shillings to the credit of a Sterling Area Account in Tanzania or in any other Sterling Area currency; 2 receipts from such countries must be obtained in Tanzania shillings from a Sterling Area Account in Tanzania or in any other Sterling Area currency. Authorized payments, includ- ing payments for imports, by residents of Tanzania to resi- dents of countries outside the Sterling Area other than Rhodesia may be made in sterling to an External Account in the United Kingdom, in Tanzania shillings to the credit of an External Account in Tanzania, or in any other non-Sterling Area currency except Rhodesian currency that is appropriate to the country of residence of the payee. Receipts from countries outside the Sterling Area other than Rhodesia may be obtained in sterling from an External Account in the United Kingdom, in Tanzania shillings from an External Account in Tanzania, or in any other specified currency 3 that is not a Sterling Area currency. Export pro- ceeds, however, may be received only in convertible curren- cies. Special regulations apply to settlements with Rhodesia. Remittances to South Africa are prohibited, w i th the excep- tion of those for pensions payable by the Government of Tanzania or by the East African Community organizations. Nonresident Accounts Sterling Area Accounts are held by residents of other Ster- ling Area countries. They may be credited freely with all authorized payments to such Sterling Area countries by resi- dents of Tanzania, with transfers from other Sterling Area Accounts, and with the proceeds from sales to an authorized dealer in Tanzania of pounds sterling or any other Sterling Area currency. They may be debited freely for payments for exports to other countries in the Sterling Area and other payments due by residents of other countries in the Sterling Area to Tanzanian residents, for payments to residents of other countries in the Sterling Area for any purpose, for transfers to other Sterling Area Accounts in Tanzania, for purchases of any Sterling Area currency, and for withdrawals by the account holder while he is temporarily resident in Tanzania. Provided that the permission of the appropriate exchange control authorities in a Sterling Area country has been obtained, Sterling Area Accounts may exceptionally be debited for transfers to External Accounts in Tanzania or elsewhere in the Sterling Area, and for purchases in Tanzania of any non-Sterling Area currency from an authorized dealer. Accounts in Tanzania shillings held by residents of countries outside the Sterling Area other than Rhodesia with authorized banks in Tanzania are, with exchange control ap- proval, designated External Accounts. They may be credited freely w i th authorized payments to such countries by resi- dents of Tanzania, with transfers from other External Ac- counts, and with the proceeds from sales of any non-Sterling Area currency (other than Rhodesian currency) by nonresi- dents of the Sterling Area to authorized dealers. Provided that the permission of the appropriate exchange control au- thorities in a Sterling Area country has been obtained, Exter- nal Accounts may also be credited with transfers from Sterling Area Accounts. They may be debited freely for pay- ments to residents of the Sterling Area, for transfers to other External Accounts in Tanzania or in any other Sterling Area country, and for purchases of non-Sterling Area currencies from authorized dealers. Nontransferable funds of residents of other countries are credited to Blocked Accounts. Balances on Blocked Accounts 1 W i th effect from January 14, 1974 Tanzania established a central rate of T Sh 7.14286 = US$1, equivalent to 0.103133 gram of f ine gold per Tanzania shilling and corresponding to T Sh 8.61675 = SDR 1. Tanzania continued to avail itself of wider margins. The relationship to the Kenya shilling and the Uganda shilling remained unchanged. 2 W i th the exception that personal remittances to residents of India and Pakistan must be made in the currency of the beneficiary's country of residence. 3 The specified currencies are listed as Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Burmese kyats, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Icelandic kronur, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, Spanish pesetas, Sri Lanka rupees, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, U.S. dollars, and all other Sterling Area currencies other than Kenya shillings, Tanzania shillings, and Uganda shillings. 417 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TANZANIA belonging to emigrants may be used for the purchase in Tan- zania of government bonds payable in Tanzania shillings and redeemable not earlier than five years from the date of acqui- sition; interest and redemption proceeds are transferable. Subject to individual permission, such balances may also be used for payments to residents not related to export transac- tions. Transfers between Blocked Accounts in Tanzania and to Blocked Accounts in Kenya and Uganda, require prior approval. Imports and Import Payments Some imports to the mainland from all sources are prohib- ited for reasons of health or security. Certain other imports are not being licensed. Imports originating in Kenya and Uganda are unrestricted but some may only be imported by or on behalf of specified parastatal organizations. Goods listed in the First Schedule of the Open General License of 1973 may be imported freely, irrespective of country of origin. Goods listed in the Second Schedule may normally be im- ported by or on behalf of specified parastatal organizations. All imports to the mainland from Zanzibar require a specific license when the goods originate outside Zanzibar. All im- ports from metropolitan Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Af- rica are prohibited. All imports into Zanzibar are made by government agen- cies. Transfer taxes are levied on a range of manufactured goods when imported from and originating in Kenya. For some of these commodities, the tax is applicable also when they are imported from and originate in Uganda. Most imports, irre- spective of their origin, are subject to sales tax at rates rang- ing up to 50 per cent of the c.i.f. value plus import du ty. Advance payments for imports are allowed in exceptional circumstances only, exchange for import payments normally not being granted until after customs clearance. Most suppli- ers' credit requires the prior approval of the Bank of Tanza- nia. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to all countries are controlled. Au- thorized banks are empowered to approve specified categories of current payments up to established limits; amounts above these limits may be approved administratively by the Bank of Tanzania. The approval of the Minister for Finance is re- quired where the transfer is proposed of income in excess of T Sh 1 million from nonresident-owned investments. Facilities exist whereby immigrant noncitizens working in Tanzania under contract in salaried employment and with a firm commitment to leave Tanzania eventually may through- out their period of employment remit abroad up to 33 V3 per cent of their monthly salary uncommitted to cover family maintenance, savings, etc. Applications to remit in excess of 33% per cent of salary or in excess of T Sh 3,000 a month are considered on their merits by the Bank of Tanzania. Specified categories of expatriate employees may remit the total amount of their salaries. Persons making uncommitted remit- tances under these arrangements are not entitled to emigra- tion facilities (see section on Capital, below). 418 There is a basic allowance for travel to countries outside East Africa of T Sh 2,000 a person every three years for persons aged 12 or older; half of this amount is available to children aged 3 to 11 years. Travelers to destinations in bor- der countries (Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozam- bique, Rwanda, Somalia, the Sudan, Uganda, Zaire, and Zambia) are restricted to T Sh 500 a year (T Sh 250 for children of 3 to 11 years). The use made of the allocation for travel to border countries is set off against the basic tourist allowance for travel to other countries. Applications for busi- ness, education, and health travel have to be referred to the Bank of Tanzania. Resident travelers are allowed to take out T Sh 100 in domestic currency. Nonresident travelers may take out foreign currency notes, travelers checks, and letters of credit up to the amount they brought in upon entry. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Portugal, all Portuguese territories, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. On the mainland, exports of products dealt with by state trading organizations and of certain other products are subject to controls and, if there is a local shortage, may be restricted. Other goods may be exported w i thout license. All principal exports of Zanzibar are sold abroad by the Zanzibar State Trading Corporation. Re-exports from Zanzibar are prohibited. Exporters are required to be registered w i th the Bank of Tanzania, and must maintain an account with a local com- mercial bank. Export proceeds must be collected in convert- ible currencies w i th in two mon ths from the date of exportation and must be surrendered. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in specified currencies (see foot- note 3) must be sold to an authorized bank upon their collec- tion. Travelers may bring in freely foreign currency notes; the import of Tanzania shilling notes must not exceed T Sh 100 in value for each returning traveler. Capital Capital transfers to all countries are subject to control by the Bank of Tanzania and are restricted. Specified capital transfers up to established amounts to all countries are approved by authorized banks; all other capital transfers require individual exchange control approval. Per- sons leaving Tanzania permanently who have been resident in Tanzania for four years immediately prior to the date of application and who have not been availing themselves of the facility of making uncommitted remittances of savings may transfer their assets up to the equivalent of T Sh 20,000 for each household. All remaining funds must be credited to a Blocked Account or otherwise brought under control; they may then be invested in approved Tanzanian securities or placed on bank deposit. Income from such investments is transferable upon accrual, and redemption proceeds become transferable upon ma tur i ty of the securities but not less than five years from the date of purchase. Furthermore, any assets in excess of the initial emigration allowance of T Sh 20,000 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution are remittable in five yearly installments of T Sh 20,000 each, after which any remaining amount will be considered for repatriation. Gifts to nonresidents require the prior approval of the Bank of Tanzania. There is no restriction on the investment of foreign funds in Tanzania, but to ensure eventual repatriation it is advisable to have the investment recognized by the Bank of Tanzania or to obtain a certificate of approved enterprise in terms of the Foreign Investment (Protection) Act, 1963. Foreign and domestic investment in specified types of production requires approval under the East African Licensing Ordinance. All imports and exports of securities require approval. Ap- proval is freely granted for the purchase by nonresidents of Tanzanian securities from residents on a recognized East Af- rican stock exchange, provided that payment is received in an appropriate manner. The income from such securities is re- mittable, as are the proceeds on resale. Purchases of securities outside Tanzania by residents are not normally permitted. All loans or overdrafts from residents to nonresidents or to foreign-controlled resident bodies require exchange control approval by the Bank of Tanzania. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Tanzania for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial and professional users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler are subject to individual licensing. Licenses are not normally granted except for im- ports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities, industrial users, and producers of newly mined gold; imports are limited to an overall import quota. Changes during 1973 January I. Remittances abroad of profits and dividends, which had been suspended since mid-1970, were resumed. February 19. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the par value was changed from 0.114592 gram to 0.103133 gram of fine gold per Tanzania shilling, corresponding to T Sh 8.61675 = SDR 1. Tanzania TANZANIA continued to avail itself of wider margins. The effective par- ity relationship for the U.S. dollar remained unchanged at T Sh 7.14286 = US$1. The relationship to the Kenya shilling and the Uganda shilling also remained unchanged. June 1. The foreign exchange plan for imports in 1973/74, covering both government and private sector imports, came in to effect. June 15. Goods imported by the Government became sub- ject to customs duties. July 2. Tanzania established a central rate of T Sh 6.90000 = US$1, equivalent to 0.106763 gram of f ine gold per Tanza- nia shilling and corresponding to T Sh 8.32377 = SDR 1. Tanzania continued to avail itself of wider margins. The rela- tionship to the Kenya shilling and the Uganda shilling re- mained unchanged. July 15. An amendment to the Exchange Control Ordi- nance required exporters to obtain approval from the Bank of Tanzania w i th respect to the manner of payments for ex- ports in relation to the type of goods exported. Furthermore, receipts from exports had to bear a proper relationship to the real value of the goods exported. August 1. The Imports Control Ordinance (Government Notice No. 171) was published. It contained the Open Gen- eral License, 1973 and revoked the Open General License, 1972. The Open General License contained three schedules. Imports by the Government became subject to licensing pro- cedures. All goods listed in the First Schedule, including goods originating in Kenya and Tanzania, could be imported under the Open General License. Goods listed in the Second Schedule could be imported only by or on behalf of specified parastatal organizations; formerly, such imports were han- dled by the State Trading Corporation. The Third Schedule specified the licensing procedure for goods subject to an im- port license and the normally prescribed payments procedure for goods covered by the Open General License. October 1. New export regulations were announced. Ex- porters were required to be registered with the Bank of Tan- zania and to maintain an account with a commercial bank in Tanzania. Proceeds from exports were to be collected in con- vertible foreign exchange w i th in two months from the date of shipment (previously collections could be made in a specified currency within six months from the date of shipment). 419 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution THAILAND Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.0368331 gram of f ine gold per Thai Baht, corresponding to B 24.1270 = SDR 1 or B 20.00 = US$1, and Thailand avails itself of wider margins. There is an Ex- change Equalization Fund which limits its operations to spot transactions in U.S. dollars with commercial banks. On De- cember 30, 1973, the buying and selling rates of the Exchange Equalization Fund for spot exchange transactions with banks in U.S. dollars were B 20.325 buying, and B 20.425 selling, per US$1; on the same date, the authorized banks' rates were B 20.30 buying, and B 20.45 selling, per US$1. The autho- rized banks' rates for other currencies are based on their buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar and the New York rates for such currencies. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Bank of Thailand on behalf of the Ministry of Finance; the Bank delegates responsibility for most transactions to authorized agents (i.e., authorized banks and authorized companies) and to autho- rized persons. All incoming exchange must be sold to an authorized agent. All outgoing payments are subject to ap- proval (given automatically for bona fide commercial transac- tions and other current payments). Imports of gold require a license issued by the Ministry of Finance. Certain other im- ports and a few exports are subject to licensing by the Minis- try of Commerce. Prescription of Currency There are no special requirements concerning the currency to be used for settlements with foreign countries; payments are made largely in sterling and related currencies or in U.S. dollars. Nonresident Accounts There are two types of nonresident accounts: Transferable Accounts and Blocked Accounts. In principle, transfers of baht to and from nonresident accounts require approval; ap- proval is not required, however, when the account is held for foreign diplomatic entities, international organizations sta- tioned in Thailand, or Thai nationals temporarily abroad. Transferable Accounts may be credited freely with the pro- ceeds from sales to authorized banks of foreign currency transferred from abroad, with amounts transferred from other Transferable Accounts, and with funds eligible for re- mittance abroad in foreign currency. Balances on Transfer- able Accounts are convertible into foreign currency at any time and may be debited freely for the purchase of foreign currencies for transfer abroad, for transfers to other Transfer- able Accounts, for payments in respect of exports, and for any other payments to residents. Funds that must be credited to Blocked Accounts include proceeds of installment sales of books, rentals accruing in Thailand, freight in transit trade, proceeds from sales of assets of emigrating residents of Thai nationality, and funds that cannot be identified as eligible for 420 credit to a Transferable Account. Transfers of baht from Blocked Accounts for the purchase of foreign currency, ex- cept for certain current payments, are subject to approval by the Bank of Thailand; approval is granted when no capital transfer on behalf of a Thai national is involved. Imports and Import Payments Most commodities may be imported freely; but import licenses are required for some commodities, and the import of certain other items is prohibited. All imports of goods originating in or shipped from Rhodesia are prohibited. Im- ports of tea leaf, tea dust, and coffee are subject to a require- ment that the importer purchase a proportionate quantity of the same type of goods produced in Thailand. Import licenses are valid for all countries except Rhodesia. Payments for imports may be approved by authorized banks upon submission of documents; the specific approval of the Bank of Thailand, which is given for all bona tide transactions, is required for advance payments in excess of US$1,400 and for opening revolving letters of credit or letters of credit with an expiry date exceeding nine months. Import- ers must obtain, in addition to the usual documents, a "certifi- cate of payment" from an authorized agent before imported goods exceeding B 10,000 in value can be cleared through customs; military equipment imported by the Ministry of Defense and certain minor categories of imports are exempt from this requirement. Payments for Invisibles There are no restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. Payments for invisibles require authorization, which is usually given by an authorized bank or otherwise by the Bank of Thailand; exchange is pro- vided freely and promptly. Cargo insurance premiums due to foreign insurers may be remitted in foreign exchange; if they are paid in baht to an agent or branch office of an insurance company registered abroad, they may be remitted as earned income after taxes. The transfer of profits and dividends is permitted freely by the Bank of Thailand. Apart from foreign travel, family maintenance abroad, and educational expenses abroad, authorized agents are permitted to approve applica- tions for exchange without supporting documents, provided that each payment does not exceed the equivalent of US$140. For foreign travel and family remittances, the amounts of exchange that an authorized agent may sell are subject to certain maximum limits. For persons traveling abroad, authorized agents may ap- prove exchange allowances not exceeding the equivalent of US$630, or US$40 a day for not more than 90 days, which- ever is the greater; for business travel, additional foreign ex- change not exceeding one half of the allowance may be obtained in certain cases for entertainment expenses. The amount of foreign exchange that an authorized bank may sell for family remittances is US$200 a month for each transferor for Europe and the United States and US$150 a month for each transferor for other countries. Amounts above these ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution THAILAND limits are approved by the Bank of Thailand upon verifica- tion. No person may take out local currency exceeding B 500 (or B 1,000 for a family traveling on one passport) or foreign currency exceeding US$ 140 (US$280 for a family traveling on a single passport) without the prior approval of the exchange control authorities. Transit passengers and tourists, however, may take out any amount of foreign exchange without prior authorization. considered on the merits of each case; approval is normally granted if it can be shown that the funds originated abroad. The contracting of suppliers' credits abroad requires Bank of Thailand approval. All other private loans taken up abroad may be registered with the Bank to facilitate approval of outward remittances. The public sector requires the approval of the National Economic Development Board to negotiate external loans. Exports and Export Proceeds Gold All exports or re-exports to Rhodesia require an individual license. Certain categories of exports are subject to licensing, irrespective of destination. 1 All other commodities may be exported freely, except to Rhodesia. The exporter is required to obtain a "certificate of exportation" from an authorized agent in order to clear the shipment through customs, as follows: for shipments of tin or rubber exceeding B 1,000 in value through any customs station, and, with minor excep- tions, for other goods exceeding B 10,000 in value through any customs station. This certificate assures repatriation of the export proceeds. Export proceeds must be collected and must be sold to authorized agents within 7 days of receipt; their surrender must take place within 15 days from the date of export if payment is made by letter of credit, 21 days if a sight bill is drawn for collection, or 15 days after the due date of a usance bill, but not later than 180 days after the date of export. Foreign tourists may freely take out precious stones and gold or platinum ornaments up to any value but require a "certificate of exportation" to take out any other articles with a total value in excess of B 10,000. The export of a few types of rice and rice products is subject to export taxes referred to as export premiums. Proceeds from Invisibles All receipts from invisibles must be sold to an authorized agent. No person may bring into Thailand local currency exceeding B 500 without a permit, and a family traveling on the same passport may not bring in more than B 1,000 with- out a permit. Travelers may bring in any amount in foreign notes and coins. Capital All outward transfers of capital, including premiums on life insurance policies, by residents or nonresidents are subject to approval. Personal capital exports by residents are restricted. The Bank of Thailand approves the remittance of donations and gifts of a reasonable amount. Foreign exchange from inward capital movements must be sold to an authorized agent and the purpose of the transfer must be declared. For- eign investments in Thailand can be accorded preferential treatment under Notice No. 227 of the National Executive Council (issued October 21, 1972); this treatment includes a guarantee of the transfer abroad of current net earnings and of capital repatriation. The repatriation of other capital is 1 Gold, platinum, precious stones, live cattle and other specified animals, sorghum, corn, rice and rice products, all kinds of sugar, brass and copper in certain forms, iron scrap and most forms of iron other than pig iron and iron ore, and Deva and Buddha images and their parts. Residents may hold and negotiate domestically gold jew- elry, gold coins, and unworked gold. Imports and exports of gold other than jewelry are subject to the following arrange- ments, unless they are effected by or on behalf of the mone- tary authorities. Commercial imports of gold in any form are restricted and require a license issued by the Ministry of Finance. For gold bullion, the Ministry periodically fixes an authorized quantity of imports. A bidding system operates under which the importer offering the highest premium by tender is awarded a license as sole importer of the authorized quantity for a certain period. In addition to this premium, which accrues to the Government, the importer is required to pay to the Ministry of Finance a fee at the rate of US$1.75 per troy ounce of gold. The fee is payable in baht at the par value. In 1973, however, no license was awarded for the importation of gold bullion. Exports of gold bullion are pro- hibited, while those of gold ornaments, when not made by foreign tourists and exceeding B 5,000 in value, require a certificate of exportation in addition to the export entry, for presentation to the customs, but bear no export duty or taxes. Foreign tourists may without a certificate of exportation take out gold ornaments up to any value. The conveyance of gold in transit is not restricted and is free of customs charges. Changes during 1973 February 14. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar was maintained unchanged at B 20.80 = US$1.

The Minister of Finance issued a Notification repealing the Notification of the Ministry of Finance issued under Article 4 (5) of the Exchange Control Act B.E. 2485 421 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution THAILAND dated October 20, 1963. The latter Notification specified the m in imum and max imum rates of exchange that authorized banks and authorized companies had to observe in spot trans- actions. July 15. The par value of the baht was changed to 0.0368331 gram of fine gold per baht; corresponding to B 24.1270 = SDR 1. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar became B 20.00 = US$1. Thailand continued to avail itself of wider margins. July 15. The Minister of Finance issued a No t if ica t ion replacing clause 2 of a Notification dated Janua ry 31, 1973 and prescribing that the exchange rate for gold transactions be based on the par value of the baht. July 15. The Minister of Finance issued a Notification governing spot transactions in foreign currencies, under Arti- cles 23, 24, and 25 of the Currency Act B.E. 2501 as amended by the Currency Act (No. 4) B.E. 2516. The main points included the following: (1) The m in imum amount of U.S. dollars that a domestic commercial bank could request from the Bank of Thailand or the Exchange Equalization Fund to effect spot transactions was US$50,000 for each transaction. (2) The Bank of Thailand or the Exchange Equalization Fund could not effect spot transactions in U.S. dollars w i th any commercial bank at rates of less than B 19.575 per US$1 or more than B 20.425 per US$1. (3) Minimum and maximum rates were set for transactions which authorized commercial banks and authorized companies had to observe in spot trans- actions in Thailand in currencies of members of the Interna- tional Monetary Fund. For the U.S. dollar these rates were B 19.55 and B 20.45 per US$1, respectively. July 17. For transactions w i th commercial banks the Ex- change Equalization Fund announced a new buy ing rate of B 19.575 per US$1 and a new selling rate of B 20.425 per US$1. July 25.

The ban on rice exports was lifted entirely. December 7. The licensing requirement was lifted for im- ports of specified fertilizers. 422 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TOGO Exchange System No par value for the currency of Togo has been established with the Fund. The un it of currency is the CFA Franc, l which is officially maintained at the rate of CFAF 1 = 0.02 French franc. Exchange transactions in French francs, the intervention currency, between the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de 1'Ouest (BCEAO) and commercial banks take place at the rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02, free of commissions. Exchange transactions relating to foreign countries, i.e., countries other than France, Monaco, and the Operations Account countries of the French Franc Area, take place in a dual exchange market at rates based on the fixed rate for the French franc and the Paris exchange rate for the foreign currency concerned in either the official exchange market or the financial franc market. Settlements eligible for the official exchange market are payments and receipts in respect of imports, exports, and most other current transactions, as well as current payments by or in favor of domestic and foreign public authorities and public bodies. All other settlements with foreign countries, as well as transactions in banknotes of foreign countries and banknotes issued by the BCEAO, take place through the financial franc market at freely fluctu- ating rates. The principal current payments and receipts channeled through the financial franc market are those relat- ing to travel expenses, capital earnings, and workers' remit- tances. Exchange rates for certain European currencies in the official market are based on par values and central rates; the effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar in this market is not confined within any announced margins. With the exception of those relating to gold, Togo's ex- change control measures do not apply to (1) France and its Overseas Departments and Territories (except the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account (Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the People's Republic of the Congo, Dahomey, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Upper Volta). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries, except Togo itself, are con- sidered foreign countries, and in principle financial relations only with foreign countries are subject to exchange control. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Ministry of Fi- nance and Economy, which also supervises borrowing abroad, the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Togo, inward direct investment and all outward investment, and the soliciting of funds in Togo for placement in foreign countries. Some of the approval authority in respect of exchange control has been delegated to authorized interme- diaries. The BCEAO is authorized to collect, either directly or through the intermediary of banks, financial institutions, the Postal Administration, and notaries public, any informa- 1 The CFA franc is issued by the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de POuest (BCEAO) and is the common currency in Dahomey, Ivory Coast, Niger, Senegal, Togo, and Upper Volta. tion necessary to compile the balance of payments statistics. All exchange transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through authorized banks or the Postal Adminis- tration. Import and export licenses are issued by the Foreign Trade Division in the Secretariat of State attached to the Presidency and in charge of Commerce, Industry, and Plan- ning, except those for gold, which are granted by the Ministry of Finance and Economy. Prescription of Currency Togo is an Operations Account country of the French Franc Area, since the BCEAO maintains an Operations Ac- count with the French Treasury; settlements with France (including its Overseas Departments and Territories except the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas), Monaco, and the other Operations Account countries of the French Franc Area are made in CFA francs, French francs, or the currency of any other Operations Account country. Settlements with all other countries are usually made through correspondent banks in France in any of the currencies of those countries or in French francs through Foreign or Financial Accounts in Francs. Certain settlements with Rhodesia are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. The crediting to nonresi- dent accounts of CFA banknotes, French banknotes, or banknotes issued by any other institute of issue that main- tains an Operations Account with the French Treasury is not permitted, except for credits to Financial Accounts held by foreign correspondents of authorized banks, which may be credited with BCEAO banknotes mailed direct to the BCEAO agency in Lome by those correspondents. Imports and Import Payments Most imports of Rhodesian origin and all imports of Por- tuguese or South African origin are prohibited. Imports from countries in the French Franc Area may be made freely, but require the prior authorization of the Sec- retariat of State attached to the Presidency and in charge of Commerce, Industry, and Planning, when valued at CFAF 10,000 or more and destined for commercial purposes. Imports from all other countries require individual import licenses when valued at CFAF 10,000 or more. In principle, the licenses are to be granted in accordance with an import program which is to be established each year and which may include recommendations by a joint French-Togolese Com- mittee, as specified in the Economic Cooperation Agreement with France; as yet, however, an import program has not been established and almost all requests for import licenses from all sources are granted. There are no formal import free lists. The issuance of import licenses for printed piece goods of Japanese origin is conditional, in principle, on the purchase of a quantity of the local product equal to the quantity to be imported; in practice, this requirement is no longer enforced. 423 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TOGO The Societe Nationale de Commerce (SONACOM) has an im- port monopoly for sugar, rice and other cereals, flour, canned milk, and soap. All import transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value ex- ceeds CFAF 500,000. Import licenses entitle importers to purchase the necessary exchange, spot, but not earlier than one mon th before shipment if a documentary credit is opened or one mon th before the payment is due if the commodities have already been imported. Payments for Invisibles Certain payments to Rhodesia are prohibited. Payments for invisibles to France, Monaco, and the other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to approval. Pay- ments for invisibles related to trade are permitted freely when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to non- residents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted freely. For tourist travel, residents traveling to countries other than France, Monaco, and the other Opera- tions Account countries of the French Franc Area may ob- tain an exchange allocation of an amount equivalent to CFAF 175,000 a person a trip for any number of trips a year (CFAF 87,500 for children under ten); any foreign exchange in excess of CFAF 5,000 remaining after return to Togo must be surrendered w i th in eight days of re-entry. For business travel, there is a special allocation of the equivalent of CFAF 20,000 a day, subject to a maxi- mum of CFAF 400,000 a trip. The transfer of the entire net salary of a foreigner working in Togo is permitted upon pre- sentation of the appropriate pay voucher, provided that the transfer takes place within three months of the pay period. Residents may at any time and without indicating the pur- pose of the transfer make payments abroad, through an au- thorized bank, of up to CFAF 50,000 per transfer. Resident and nonresident travelers going to foreign countries may take out up to a maximum of CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO banknotes, French banknotes, and banknotes issued by other Operations Account countries. Resident travelers to other countries of the French Franc Area may take out any amount in BCEAO banknotes but if going to a country that is not a member of the West African Monetary Union they must declare to the customs the amount taken out if it exceeds CFAF 250,000. Nonresident travelers may take out foreign banknotes and coins up to the amount declared by them on en try 2 or, if no declaration has been made, up to the equivalent of CFAF 175,000. Nonresident travelers may also freely take out any amount of letters of credit and travelers checks drawn up in their names abroad. 2 This amount is adjusted for (1) the amount of foreign currency sold for CFA francs; and (2) for any foreign currency acquired in Togo by (a) debit to a Financial Account in Francs or a Foreign Account in Foreign Currency, (b) the conversion of foreign currency travelers checks, etc., made out in the name of the traveler, and (c) any repurchases of foreign currency (permitted up to CFAF 175,000) w i th CFA francs resulting from the sale of foreign currency. 424 Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to all countries require licenses. Certain exports to Rhodesia and all exports to Portugal and South Africa are prohibited. The Office des Produits Agricoles du Togo (OPAT) has a monopoly over the export of cacao, coffee, cotton, groundnuts, and certain other commodities. Export proceeds received in currencies other than those of France or another Operations Account country must be surrendered w i th in one mon th after the due date, which cannot be later than 180 days of the arrival of the goods at their destination; authorized diamond purchasing offices, however, may retain such foreign currency proceeds in foreign currency accounts with authorized banks in Togo. All export transactions relat- ing to foreign countries must be domiciled with an authorized bank when their value exceeds CFAF 500,000. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles with France, Mo- naco, and other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area may be retained. All amounts due from residents of other countries in respect of services, and all income earned in those countries from foreign assets, must be collected and surrendered w i th in one mon th of the due date or the date of receipt. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of banknotes and coins issued by the BCEAO, the Bank of France, or any ins t i tu te of issue maintaining an Oper- ations Account with the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign banknotes and coins (except gold coins) of countries outside the French Franc Area. Resident travelers must w i th in eight days sell to an authorized bank any foreign banknotes and foreign currency travelers checks they bring in in excess of CFAF 5,000. Capital Certain capital transfers to Rhodesia are prohibited. Capi- tal movements between Togo and France, Monaco, and other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area are free of exchange control; capital transfers to all other countries require exchange control approval by the Minister of Finance and Economy and are restricted, but capital re- ceipts from such countries are permitted freely. Special controls (additional to any exchange control re- quirements that may be applicable) are maintained over bor- rowing abroad, over inward direct investment and all outward investment, over the issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign securities in Togo, and over the soliciting of funds in Togo for placing abroad; these controls relate to the transactions themselves, not to payments or receipts. With the exception of those over foreign securities and those over the soliciting of funds in Togo, these control measures do not apply to relations with France and its Overseas De- partments and Territories (except the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas), Monaco, the other member countries of the West African Monetary Union, and those other countries whose institute of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account. There also are special controls appli- ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution cable to all countries other than Togo with respect to imports and exports of gold. All investments abroad by residents of Togo require prior authorization by the Minister of Finance and Economy .3 Foreign direct investments in Togo 4 must be declared to the Minister of Finance and Economy before they are made. The Minister has a period of two mon ths from receipt of the declaration dur ing which he may request the postponement of the projects submitted to him. The total or partial liquida- tion of any inward direct investment or any outward invest- ment also requires prior declaration to the Minister. Both the mak ing and the liquidation of investments, whether these are Togolese investments abroad or foreign investments in Togo, must be reported to the Minister of Finance and Economy and to the BCEAO w i th in 20 days following each operation. Direct investments are defined as investments imp ly ing con- trol of a company or enterprise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 per cent in the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale, of foreign securities in Togo requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance and Economy. Exempt from authorization, how- ever, are operations in connection w i th (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Togolese Government and (2) shares that are similar to, or may be substituted for, securities whose issuing, advertising, or offering for sale in Togo has previ- ously been authorized. Borrowing by residents from nonresidents requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance and Economy. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans constituting a direct investment, which are subject to prior declaration, as indicated above; (2) loans contracted by registered banks; (3) loans taken up either by industrial firms to finance works abroad or by approved international mer- chan t ing houses to finance imports or exports; and (4) in certain circumstances, any other loans, provided that the outstanding amount for any one borrower does not exceed CFAF 100 million. The repayment of any foreign borrowing requires the prior authorization of the Minister; exempt from this requirement are loans constituting a direct investment, loans taken up by authorized banks, and any loans exempted by the Minister. Lending abroad is subject only to special authorization by the Directorate of Economy. The lending of CFA francs to nonresidents for periods of up to two years, however, is freely permitted. Under the provisions of the general tax legislation, certain fiscal benefits are accorded to specified new investment (for- eign and domestic) in both new and existing enterprises. Also, certain enterprises, in accordance w i th their importance to the economic development of Togo, may be granted by the Government, for a specified number of years, special privi- leges relating to the maintenance of existing taxes and the 3 Inc lud ing those made th rough the intermediary of foreign companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in Togo and those made by branches or subsidiaries abroad of companies in Togo. 4 Inc lud ing those made by companies in Togo that are directly or indirectly under foreign control and those made by branches or subsidiaries in Togo of foreign companies.

An Investment Law (Law No. 65-10 of July 21, 1965, as amended by Ordinance No. 2 of January 10, 1973) applicable to both foreign and domestic capital lists the types of enter- prises that may be designated as "priority enterprises," pro- vided that the head office is in Togo. Such firms may sign a special founding agreement by which they receive certain tax benefits. Firms that undertake to invest at least CFAF 20 million may receive a guarantee in respect of their taxation over a number of years. The law guarantees the right of free transfer abroad of capital invested in Togo and of all invest- ment income therefrom. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Togo. Imports and exports of gold from or to any other coun try require prior authorization by the Minister of Finance and Economy. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the Treasury or the BCEAO; (2) imports and exports of manufactured articles containing a minor quan t i ty of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles); and (3) imports and exports by travelers of gold objects up to a combined weight of 500 grams. Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declaration. Changes during 1973 January 2. A Presidential Ordinance of November 29, 1972 was published which conferred on SONACOM the import mo- nopoly for rice and other cereals, sugar, flour, soap, and canned milk. January 10. Ordinance No. 2 amended the Investment Law. January 29. The commissions levied by the BCEAO on transfers to France were made identical with those on trans- fers to countries outside the French Franc Area. February 13. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the exchange rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02 was maintained; the effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously CFAF 255.785 = US$1, became CFAF 230.207 = US$1. March 19. With the entry into effect of new margins ar- rangements between the French franc and certain other Euro- pean currencies, and the maintenance of the exchange rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02, the CFA franc began to appreciate in terms of the U.S. dollar. April 11. Circular No. 9 provided that, when a documen- tary credit was opened, import payments could be made upon submission of evidence that the goods would be shipped to Togo within a month, and that, if the goods had already been imported, the foreign exchange could be acquired at the earli- est one mon th before the due date fixed in the commercial contract.

No transactions take place at the par value, however. A fixed relationship with sterling is maintained of TT$4.80 = £ stg. 1, and all transactions except those in sterling and currencies directly linked to sterling take place at fluctuating rates.On December 31,1973 the Central Bank's buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar (inclusive of exchange charges) were TT$206.707 and TTS208.932, respec- tively, per US$100. The Central Bank quotes daily rates at which it stands ready to deal with the commercial banks in certain foreign currencies as well as the rates at which the commercial banks must operate with the public in these currencies in transac- tions not exceeding TT$ 100,000. ! For transactions in excess of TT$ 100,000 the commercial banks are required to quote rates to the public not less favorable than those fixed by the Central Bank for smaller transactions. Foreign exchange transactions through the Central Bank are for amounts of TT$25,000 and above and are subject to exchange charges up to a maximum of 1 per cent on inward and outward transfers; at present the rates charged by the Central Bank to commer- cial banks are V2 of 1 per cent on outward transfers and nil on inward transfers. Sterling exchange transactions through commercial banks are subject to varying exchange charges according to the amount and mode of transfer. The banks maintain fixed exchange rates of TT$4.80 = £ stg. 1 and EC$4.80 = £ stg. 1 (see below) and charge commissions of 7/8 of 1 per cent and V16 of 1 per cent, respectively, for sales and purchases of telegraphic transfers of £ stg. 50,000 or more. Notes issued by the East Caribbean Currency Au tho r i ty (East Caribbean dollars) and the central banks of Barbados, Jamaica, and Guyana are not legal tender in Trinidad and Tobago, but under an arrangement with the monetary au- thorities in those areas the notes are purchased by the mone- tary authorities and are repatriated by them in return for reciprocity of treatment with respect to collections of Trini- dad and Tobago dollars.2 East Caribbean dollars and the currencies of Barbados and Guyana are purchased at the parity rates; Jamaica dollars are purchased at the middle rate determined on the basis of the prevailing sterling/U.S. dollar rate. 1 The currencies for which the Central Bank quotes daily rates are Canadian dollars, deutsche mark, French francs, Japanese yen, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars, in addition to Guyana dollars, Jamaica dollars, and East Caribbean dollars. 2 The East Caribbean dollar was issued on October 6, 1965 by the East Caribbean Currency Au tho r i ty, pursuant to the East Caribbean Currency Agreement of 1965, to replace the West Indian dollar at par. The East Caribbean dollar, which is the monetary unit of Antigua, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent, has a fixed relationship to sterling of ECS4.80 = £ stg. 1. This corresponds to a relationship to the U.S. dollar of ECS1.84211 = US$1. The au tho r i ty to administer exchange control is vested in the Central Bank, acting as agent of the Government. The Central Bank has delegated its exchange control au thor i ty w i th respect to import payments to certain officials of the M in is try of Indu s t ry and Commerce and with respect to payments up to specified amounts for certain current invisi- bles to authorized banks. Import and export licenses, when required, are issued by the Trade and Commerce Division of the Ministry of Indus- try and Commerce. The exchange control system provides for compulsory sur- render of foreign currency 3 and for control over both current and capital transactions. 4 All overseas payments and trans- fers require the approval of the exchange control authorities; payments to Rhodesia and South Africa are prohibited. Short-term credit transactions, such as the granting of credit, loan, or overdraft facilities by resident banks to nonresidents and local nonresident-controlled companies, are also subject to control. Prescription of Currency Trinidad and Tobago has ceased to be a Scheduled Terri- tory in terms of the U.K. Exchange Control Act, 1947 but under current U.K. exchange control regulations continues to be regarded as a country of the Overseas Sterling Area. In practice, settlements with residents of other parts of the Ster- ling Area may be made only in sterling or other Sterling Area currencies. Authorized payments, including payments for im- ports, to residents of countries outside the Sterling Area other than Rhodesia may be made in sterling to the credit of an External Account in any other part of the Sterling Area, or by crediting an External Account in Trinidad and Tobago dollars, or in any non-Sterling Area currency. Payments from countries outside the Sterling Area other than Rhodesia must be received in sterling from an External Account in any other part of the Sterling Area, or by debiting an External Account in Trinidad and Tobago dollars, or in any specified currency 5 other than Rhodesian currency. Special regulations apply to Rhodesia. Nonresident Accounts There are two types of nonresident accounts: External Ac- counts and Blocked Accounts. External Accounts may be opened by commercial banks for nonresidents of Trinidad and Tobago. These accounts may be credited with payments by residents of Trinidad and Tobago 3 Under Trinidad and Tobago's exchange control regulations, all currencies other than the Trinidad and Tobago dollar are considered foreign currencies. 4 If the business of a trader, firm, or company involves constant receipts and payments in foreign currencies, permission may be granted for the retention of a portion of receipts in a Foreign Currency Account, subject to the requirement that periodic statements of credits and debits to the account must be submitted to the authorities. 5 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Burmese kya ts, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, Rhodesian currency, South African rand, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. 427 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO that have been approved by the exchange control authorities; w i th transfers from other External Accounts; and w i th pro- ceeds f rom the sale of gold and foreign currencies to an autho- rized dealer. They may be debited for payments to residents of Trinidad and Tobago; for transfers to other External Ac- counts; and for purchases of foreign currencies. The funds in these accounts are treated as equivalent to External Account sterling or any other foreign currency and may be transferred freely between residents of countries outside Trinidad and Tobago, w i th the exception that transfers f rom External Ac- counts held by residents of the Sterling Area to any coun try outside Trinidad and Tobago other than that of the hold- er's residence are conditional upon the Central Bank being satisfied that the exchange control authorities of the holder's coun t ry of residence do not object. Blocked Accounts may be credited w i th funds that may not be credited to External Accounts (e.g., proceeds from the sale by a nonresident of capital assets in Trinidad and Tobago, or proceeds from the sale of sterling securities). The use of bal- ances in Blocked Accounts is subject to authorization. Blocked funds may be reinvested in local securities which are not redeemable either optionally or con trac tua l ly w i th in four years from the date of acquisition. The income from such securities, and the proceeds at ma tu r i ty of any that are re- deemable, may be credited to an External Account. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Rhodesia are prohibited and no licenses are issued for imports from South Africa. Most imports from other countries are free of quan t i ta t ive restriction. For import control purposes, countries are divided in to two groups: (1) Albania, Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, Czecho- slovakia, Eastern Germany, Hunga ry, Nor th Korea, Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, and the U.S.S.R.; and (2) all other countries except Rhodesia and South Africa. The import regulations include prohibition or stringent control, state trad ing, ind iv idual licensing, and open general license arrangements. (1) Some of the main imports that are prohibited or are subject to stringent control are cosmetics, saccharin, coffee and cocoa beans, mechanical gambling devices, beer in con- tainers other than ten-ounce glass bottles and cans, and com- plete passenger automobiles. Firearms, ammun i t ion, narcotics, and certain other goods are either prohibited or rigidly controlled for security and health reasons. (2) Certain products covered by the Agricultural Market- ing Protocol of the Caribbean Free Trade Association (CARIFTA), as well as imported rice in bulk are the only commodities subject to state trading. This rice is normally imported from Guyana under government contracts, at agreed prices. 6 (3) All commodities other than those specified under (1) and (2) above are imported under either an individual license or an open general license arrangement. As indicated below, 6 Packaged rice may be imported th rough normal commercial channels, but such impo r ts are not usua l ly allowed f rom countries other th an Guyana unless the contracted supplies are not fo r thcom ing. 428 the scope of the arrangement depends on the countries from which the commodities are imported. (a) Imports from Albania, Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Hungary, North Korea, Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, and the U.S.S.R. All imports from these countries require a specific license. In practice, licenses are granted freely for imports from Czecho- slovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia of commodities not on the "negative" list mentioned under (b) below. For the other countries in this group, licenses are granted only for essential goods. (b) Imports from all other countries except Rhodesia and South Africa. For imports from these countries, a "negative" list is published which lists all goods subject to individual licensing. (Specific licenses are usually not required for the importation of such goods, however, when they qualify for preferential treatment w i th in CARIFTA or the Caribbean Common Market; Trinidad and Tobago is a member of both.) All other goods may be imported under open general license. The "negative" list comprises over 400 tariff items. Licenses for these items may be issued by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, depending on the supply position of the domestic indus t ry. Whenever restrictions are applied on imports from countries other than those under (a) above, no discrimination is practiced because of the country of origin or the currency involved, with the exception that CARIFTA and Caribbean Common Market commitments are taken into account. Payments for all imports require an exchange license. If prescription of currency regulations are complied with, ex- change licenses are granted without restriction or undue delay whenever the authorities are satisfied that no unauthorized capital transfer is involved. Payments for Invisibles Payments for current invisibles require the specific ap- proval of the authorities. Applications for foreign exchange must be supported by appropriate documentary evidence. As a matter of policy, no restrictions are imposed on pay- ments for current international transactions, except where payments to Rhodesia and South Africa are concerned. Un- der au thor i ty delegated by the Government, the authorized banks may approve applications for foreign exchange within prescribed limits for certain invisibles. When additional amounts are needed, the approval of the authorities is re- quired and this is granted provided that unauthorized capital transfers are not involved. The basic allowance for tourist travel is TT$ 1,200 a person a year. Residents and nonresidents may take out Trinidad and Tobago notes up to the equivalent of TT$50. Travelers who are regarded as residents of Trinidad and Tobago may export part or all of their basic travel allowance (TT$ 1,200) in for- eign currency notes. Nonresidents visiting Trinidad and To- bago may, on departure, take out foreign currency notes up to the amount brought in by them. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Rhodesia are prohibited and no licenses are issued for exports to South Africa. Exports of certain listed goods require an individual license. The list includes some foods tuffs, arms and explosives, animals, gold, and petroleum and petroleum products produced in Trinidad and Tobago, as well as specified products (about 40 tariff items) not pro- duced there. Exports of all other commodities are permitted by an open general license. General licenses have been issued to permit petroleum companies to export without specific licenses. Export proceeds received in foreign currencies must be surrendered, but exporters of certain goods, notably petro- leum, may be authorized to retain abroad a portion of their proceeds. In practice, the petroleum companies operating in Trinidad and Tobago repatriate foreign exchange to the ex- tent of their local currency needs. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from current invisibles received in foreign curren- cies must be surrendered. Insurance, shipping, and similar companies operating in Trinidad and Tobago are usually authorized to maintain operating accounts for receipts and expenditures in foreign currency which are inherent parts of their businesses. These companies give periodic accounts of their exchange transactions to the authorities. Residents and nonresidents may bring in Trinidad and Tobago currency notes up to the equivalent of TT$50. For- eign currency notes may be imported freely by residents and nonresidents. Capital Capital transfers from Trinidad and Tobago require ap- proval and generally are restricted. However, repayment of commercial credits and transfers of legacies are permitted freely, and gifts to nonresidents and emigration allowances are approved up to specified limits. Furthermore, as a matter of policy, capital transfers to other CARIFTA countries are permitted liberally. For transactions in securities, 14 authorized depositories have been appointed in Trinidad and Tobago. Restrictions are placed on the import and export of all securities other than securities expressed in Trinidad and Tobago dollars. Contractual amortization on sterling securities is permit- ted, and also on mortgages and other loans if the original borrowing occurred prior to September 1939 or was subse- quently approved by the exchange control authorities. Proceeds from the sale of securities or other investments owned by nonresidents of Trinidad and Tobago may not ordinarily be transferred and are eligible for credit only to a Blocked Account (see section on Nonresident Accounts, above); however, approval is often given to residents to pur- chase such assets. Nonresident capital invested in Trinidad and Tobago after January 1950 may be repatriated together with capital gains, provided that the investment has been approved by the Government. TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO Residents may transfer prescribed securities to persons res- ident outside Trinidad and Tobago, with the prior approval of the exchange control authorities, provided that the full proceeds of sale are received in foreign currency or sterling from an External Account in any other part of the Sterling Area. Foreign exchange is not normally provided for portfo- lio investment by residents in foreign securities, but when securities are sold or redeemed in a market outside Trinidad and Tobago, the proceeds may either be brought in and sold to an authorized dealer at the official market rate of exchange, or, with the prior approval of the exchange control authori- ties, be invested outside Trinidad and Tobago in similar secu- rities. Nonresidents may sell local securities, provided that the proceeds are credited to a Blocked Account or are reinvested in other local securities which are either irredeemable or not redeemable within four years from the date of purchase. The laws of Trinidad and Tobago do not discriminate be- tween nationals and foreigners in the formation and operation of companies in that country. Foreigners are required, how- ever, to obtain a license under the Aliens (Landholding) Ordi- nance in order to hold interest in real estate or to hold shares in local companies. Prospective foreign investors must obtain approval for their project from the authorities in Trinidad and Tobago in order to be able to repatriate capital and capital gains. The proposed project must satisfy the authori- ties that it will be either a net earner or a net saver of any currency other than the Trinidad and Tobago dollar (not necessarily the original currency of investment) or, alterna- tively, that if any loss is involved it can be justified in terms of other benefits to the country. Since 1950, the Government has enacted basic incentive legislation designed to attract domestic and foreign invest- ment in manufacturing and in import-substitution industries. This provides for the granting of certain concessions to indus- tries declared to be pioneer industries, i.e., industries which have not previously existed in Trinidad and Tobago or which are not being conducted on a commercial scale, or any indus- try for which there are favorable prospects for fu ture develop- ment. Every pioneer manufacturer is entitled to temporary relief from import duties and taxes and to other privileges. The proceeds (including capital gains) realized from part or all of a direct capital investment made after January 1, 1950 by a nonresident of Trinidad and Tobago in an approved project may, if desired, be repatriated at any time. The invest- ment may have been, or may be, made in one or more of the following ways: in foreign currency (including sterling) ap- propriate to the investor's country of residence; in sterling eligible for remittance to the nonresident investor; or in goods and services supplied from the country of the investor. This right to repatriate funds is, however, subject to the following conditions: (1) The right will not normally apply to the purchase of shares on a stock exchange unless this purchase formed an integral part of an approved capital investment project. (2) When an investment did not require permission under the exchange control regulations, e.g., when it was made through a local branch, the right will be allowed only if the 429 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO investor obtained exchange control approval of his project at the time the investment was made. There are limitations on the extent to which banks may grant finance to nonresident individuals and firms (other than residents of other CARIFTA countries) and to nonresi- dent-controlled local companies. Such companies are nor- mally required to raise any local capital needed to supplement their assets by issuing either shares or bonds to residents of Trinidad and Tobago. Each commercial bank must ma in ta in the mon th ly average of its net foreign exchange position w i th in a specified quan t i ta t ive ceiling. Gold Gold is defined by the Exchange Control Act, 1970 as gold coin and bullion. The regulations provide tha t, except w i th specific exemptions and permissions granted by the Minister of Finance: (1) one party to every transaction in gold between residents must be an authorized bank; (2) gold held by resi- dents must be surrendered to an authorized bank; and (3) gold may not be taken or sent out of Trinidad and Tobago. Residents are permitted in appropriate cases, however, to purchase, hold, or sell gold coins in Trinidad and Tobago for numismatic purposes. Control on the import and export of gold is administered by the Ministry of Indus t ry and Commerce by regulations scheduled under the Trade Ordinance, 1958. Imports of gold jewelry are on open general license, but imports of gold other than jewelry are subject to specific import licenses issued by the Ministry of Indus t ry and Commerce; such licenses are not normally issued except to the monetary authorities and au- thorized industrial users. Exports of gold, whether jewelry or otherwise, are subject to specific export licenses issued by the Ministry of Indus t ry and Commerce; such licenses for gold other than jewelry are not normally granted except to the monetary authorities. Imports of unrefined gold are subject to import du ty at 5 per cent (preferential du ty) or 15 per cent (general du ty), and those of par t ly worked gold at 15 per cent (preferential du ty) or 25 per cent (general du ty). They are free of purchase tax. Changes during 1973 During the year several commodities were added to those requ ir ing a specific import license. January 16. The buy ing and selling rates for Jamaica dol- lars hencefor th were based on the prevailing s ter l ing /U .S. dollar rate; previously, fixed rates were quoted. January 17. The Central Bank suspended the au thor i ty granted to commercial banks to deal in gold and foreign exchange, a l though the banks were permitted to deal in for- eign exchange for the account of the Central Bank for a limited range of transactions. Normal foreign exchange trans- actions were resumed on January 31. February 13. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the fixed relationship between the Trinidad and Tobago dollar and sterling was maintained at TT$4.80 = £ stg. 1 and the Trinidad and Tobago dollar continued to float w i th sterling. February 20. Dealings in foreign exchange were again sus- pended; normal trading resumed on February 28. March 7. The Central Bank suspended its cover for deal- ings in foreign exchange by commercial banks; it was resumed on March 20. March 12. The basic allowance for tourist travel was re- duced from TT$2,000 to TT$ 1,200. August 1. Trinidad and Tobago became one of the four initial members of the Caribbean Commun i ty and the Carib- bean Common Market. A new import tariff schedule, based on the Brussels Tariff Nomenclature, came in to effect. Prefer- ential duties were applied to imports of goods of Caribbean Common Market origin. 430 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TUNISIA Exchange Rate System The par value is 1.69271 grams of f ine gold per Tunisian Dinar, corresponding to D 0.525 = SDR 1 or D 0.435197 = US$1, and Tunisia avails itself of wider margins. Buy ing and selling rates for the French f ranc (the commercial f ranc and the financial franc) and certain other convertible curren- cies l are fixed daily by the Central Bank of Tunisia. The buying and selling rates of the authorized banks are identical with those of the Central Bank. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Central Bank, including the authorization of payments for imports and in- visibles; some authority is delegated to the authorized banks. Trade control is administered by the Directorate of Trade of the Ministry of National Economy which, in collaboration with the Central Bank, establishes import quotas and issues import and export licenses. Suppliers1 credits are screened by the Directorate-General of External Finance in the Ministry of Finance. Prescription of Currency For payment purposes, countries are classified as follows: (1) the French Franc Area; (2) the bilateral group, comprising countries with which Tunisia has concluded bilateral pay- ments agreements (Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Egypt, Eastern Germany, Hungary, India, Poland, Romania, and the U.S.S.R. 2) and (3) the area of convertibility, comprising all other countries. Settlements with the French Franc Area generally take place in French francs, although the Central Bank may authorize or prescribe the use of other currencies. Settlements with countries in the bilateral group are made in clearing dollars with Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Egypt, Eastern Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Romania, in rupees with India, in Tunisian dinars w i th the U.S.S.R. (for certain linked transactions), and in Swiss agreement francs with the People's Republic of China; settle- ments with countries in the area of convertibility are generally made in convertible currencies quoted by the Central Bank (see footnote 1) or in convertible Tunisian dinars through the Foreign Accounts of residents of those countries. Payments for imports must normally be made, in accordance w i th the foregoing, on the basis of the country of origin. Certain settle- ments between Tunisia and Morocco may be effected through accounts at the two central banks. Under a triangular com- pensation agreement with Bulgaria and India, settlements are made in Indian rupees through a Special Account at the Bank of Bulgaria. Payments to Israel, Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. 1 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, Finnish markkaa, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Libyan dinars, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. 2 With effect from January 1, 1974 settlements with Bulgaria, Czechoslova- kia, Hungary, Poland, and U.S.S.R. took place in convertible currencies. Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dinars may be held by residents of countries w i th which Tunisia does not maintain payments agreements. They may be credited freely with au- thorized payments by residents to the holders of the accounts and w i th dinar proceeds from sales to the Central Bank of convertible currencies (except banknotes); all other credits require prior authorization. They may be debited freely for payments of any k ind in Tunisia (irrespective of the country of residence of the nonresident payor), for transfers to other Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dinars or to Foreign Ac- counts in Bilateral Dinars, and for the purchase of any foreign currency from the Central Bank. Transfers between these accounts and from these accounts to Foreign Accounts in Bilateral Dinars may be made freely. Foreign Accounts in Bilateral Dinars may be held by resi- dents of countries of the bilateral group and are designated according to the holder's coun try of residence. They may be credited freely with dinar proceeds from sales to the Central Bank of convertible currencies, w i th transfers from other For- eign Accounts in Bilateral Dinars related to the same coun try, and w i th transfers from Foreign Accounts in Convertible Dinars; all other credits require prior authorization. They may be debited freely for the purchase from the Central Bank of the currency of the coun try to which the account relates, for all payments in Tunisia (subject to proper residential status of payor and beneficiary), and for local living expenses of persons resident in the coun try to which the account re- lates. Transfers between Foreign Accounts in Bilateral Dinars related to the same country may also be made freely. Foreign Accounts in Foreign Currencies may be established by nonresidents by transfers of convertible foreign currencies. They may also be credited with the proceeds of checks or travelers checks expressed in convertible currencies. Funds in these accounts may at any time be transferred abroad and they may also be sold to the Central Bank. Capital Accounts may be held by residents of any coun try. The opening of a Capital Account by a nonresident of Tuni- sian nationality or his spouse must be authorized by the Central Bank. Foreign banks may hold global Capital Ac- counts for their nonresident customers. Subject to certain conditions, Capital Accounts may be credited, w i thout prior approval of the Central Bank, w i th the proceeds of the sale on the stock exchange of Tunisian securities, amortization on Tunisian securities, the sales proceeds of real estate or rights to real estate situated in Tunisia, and with any bank balances that are not transferable under the rules of the Central Bank. Subject to certain conditions, these accounts may be debited for the purchase of Tunisian securities, participations in com- panies, and real estate. Irrespective of the holder's country of residence, Capital Accounts may freely be debited for living expenses in Tunisia of the holder and his family, up to D 50 a person a week, subject to a limit of D 1,000 for each family a year. Some of the above operations may be made freely through the intermediary of authorized banks, while certain others (e.g., debits resulting from the purchase of business concerns or securities not quoted on the Tunisian stock ex- 431 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TUNISIA change and all credits not relating to real estate transactions) require the authorization of the Central Bank. Internal Accounts of Nonresidents are intended ma in ly for foreigners staying temporarily in Tunisia and ga in fu l ly em- ployed there; the opening of these accounts requires the ap- proval of the Central Bank. Internal Nonresident Export Accounts (comptes INRE) are used for the salaries of foreign nationals employed in enter- prises covered by Law No. 72-38, which provides for certain export incentives. Suspense Accounts are used for the purpose of crediting all proceeds accruing in Tunisia to nonresidents which may not be credited to other nonresident accounts either in accor- dance w i th a general or an individual license of the Central Bank of Tunisia. These accounts may also be credited upon departure w i th bank balances and sales proceeds of real estate owned by foreign nationals leaving Tunisia permanently; the transfer abroad of such funds is normally permitted in accor- dance w i th rules applied by the Central Bank and the remain- der is directed to a Capital Account. Subject to certain conditions, Suspense Accounts may be debited w i thout the prior authorization of the Central Bank in respect of pur- chases of Tunisian securities, subscriptions to issues of short-term debentures or bonds, payments to the Tunisian Government or public ins t i tu t ions, and settlement of l iv ing expenses incurred in Tunisia by the account holder (irrespec- t ive of his coun t ry of residence) or his fam i ly up to D 50 a person a week and not exceeding D 1,000 a year for any one fam i ly. All other debits to these accounts require the ind iv id- ual authorization of the Central Bank of Tunisia. Savings Accounts in Foreign Currency may be maintained w i th the Postal Administration in the names of Tunisian nationals who are working abroad. These accounts may be credited w i th the countervalue of a portion of the holder's foreign currency earnings. They may be debited freely. Imports and Import Payments All imports from Israel, Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited, and the fo l low ing does not apply to these countries. W i th the exception of imports originating in the French Franc Area, all impor ts require import licenses, importers' cards, import certificates, or annual import authorizations. All import applications must be submitted for the approval (avis technique) of the competent m in is t ry or government agency. The prior approval of the M in is t ry of Finance is required for all imports, irrespective of origin, that are fi- nanced w i th suppliers' credits. Import licenses must be ap- proved by the Directorate of Trade of the Ministry of National Economy and by the Central Bank, which au thor- izes the corresponding payment. Imports f rom the French Franc Area require a payments authorization from the Cen- tral Bank, an importers' card, an import certificate, or an annual import authorization. In practice, however, all appli- cations for payments authorizations are submitted by the Central Bank to the Directorate of Trade for prior endorse- ment. 432 Certain imports are regulated by arrangements which ap- ply to all countries: (1) "Prohibited" imports may be licensed in exceptional circumstances, at the discretion of the authori- ties. (2) Some commodities or groups of commodities are licensed against annual global quotas. (3) Certain spare parts and a few other commodities may be imported free of license against the presentation of an importer's card up to D 500 a year for each importer. (4) Some commodities or groups of commodities may be imported freely and without license by industrialists, craftsmen, and farmers for their own use, and by merchants w i th in their line of trade, against an "import certificate." (5) Imports required by manufacturers for their own use or by certain agencies are licensed under annual import authorizations. Bilateral quotas are fixed annually for certain imports from France not covered by any of the f ive arrangements outlined above. Imports under these quotas require licenses. The quo- tas cover such goods as perfumery and cosmetics, toilet soap, clothing, air conditioners, washing and drying machines, and automobiles. In addition, special procedures apply to certain other imports from France that are affected by Tunisia's Association Agreement with the EEC; such commodities also require a license when imported from France (see below). All imports not covered by one of the arrangements de- scribed above, when originating in countries outside the French Franc Area with which Tunisia does not maintain bilateral payments agreements, are regulated as follows (sub- ject to fu r ther special arrangements that apply to imports from EEC countries): import licenses for goods included in a liberalized list are in principle issued freely, while all other goods are licensed w i th in quotas under bilateral trade agree- ments, w i th in global quotas, or on a more discretionary basis when originating in countries w i th which no agreement is in force. 3 In addition to the above arrangements, there are certain special procedures for imports of specified goods originating in member countries of the EEC. Impor ts from countries w i th which Tunisia maintains bi- lateral payments agreements are licensed within bilaterally agreed quota limits unless the goods are among the few for which global quotas have been set. Imports of specified com- modities are licensed in such a manner as to ensure the utiliza- tion of tied foreign aid. Certain commodities are imported under state trading. These include goods subject to government monopolies, e.g., tobacco, matches, playing cards, and imports from the United States under U.S. P.L. 480. In addition, certain gov- ernment agencies, of which the main one is the Office du Commerce, have been granted a monopoly over the import of commodities fa l l ing within their sphere of activity (coffee, tea, sugar, specified fru i ts, etc.). Moreover, certain other com- modities, such as timber, paper, and certain metallurgical products, may be imported only by importers who are mem- bers of an importers' association. Imports by such associa- 3 Countries w i th which bilateral trade agreements are in force include most European OECD countries, in addition to the countries w i th which payments agreements have been concluded (see section on Prescription of Currency, above). ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution tions and by state agencies are subject to the same licensing arrangements as those applicable to private imports. To obtain an import license, importers must be listed in the commercial register and must have received a code number. All import documents invo lv ing payments must be domiciled (registered) w i th an authorized bank. In addition to customs duties, a number of import taxes are applied. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require the approval of the Central Bank; for some invisibles this au tho r i ty has been delegated to the authorized banks. Payments for a number of current invisibles are approved freely, provided that they are properly documented. These include various payments related to international trade (e.g., port services, warehousing, commissions, brokerage, and charges and prof i ts related to transit operations) and pay- ments for processing, repair, assembly, royalties, patents and trademarks, taxes, fines, and court expenses, as well as pay- ments of interest and amortization arising from contractual obligations to nonresidents. Approval is also given for remit- tances of profits and dividends due to nonresidents. In addition, exporters holding balances on EFAC accounts (see section on Exports and Export Proceeds, below) may use these freely for expenditures abroad in connection w i th par- ticipation in international trade fairs, and for customs duties and other expenses related to shipment of exports to France. Exporters as well as hotel owners may use EFAC balances freely for pub l ic i ty expenses abroad, and up to fixed limits (see below) for certain other expenses. Enterprises producing for export and covered by Law No. 72-38 may freely make certain payments for invisibles; amoun ts credited to the Busi- ness Travel Accounts of resident firms covered by Law No. 72-38 in convertible dinars may be used for business travel up to D 4,000 a year for each enterprise. Payments for certain other current invisibles are approved up to fixed limits. Residents traveling abroad as tourists are entitled once a year to an exchange allocation equivalent to D 50 a person (D 25 for children under ten). The allocation for s tudy abroad is D 70 a mon th. Exporters holding EFAC accounts may use such balances up to the equivalent of D 2,000 a year for business travel abroad, and hotel owners may use balances in EFAC accounts w i thout l im i t; the use of excess amounts by exporters may be approved by the Central Bank in certain circumstances, depending on the magn i tude of their exports. Foreign nationals employed under contract may transfer up to 50 per cent of their net basic wages or salaries, subject to a maximum of D 150 a mon th if their fam i ly lives in Tunisia. Foreign experts employed by the public sector may transfer abroad their mon th ly salaries up to the limits laid down in their contracts. Foreign salaried workers born in Tunisia may transfer 30 per cent of their net basic salaries, up to D 80 a mon th. The export of Tunisian banknotes is prohibited. Unless Central Bank permission is obtained, the reconversion of do- mestic banknotes by nonresident travelers is restricted to 30 per cent of the amount of foreign currency previously sold, subject to a maximum of D 100. TUNISIA Exports and Export Proceeds All exports to Israel, Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. Certain exports are liberalized. Nonliberalized exports require an export authorization when sold to the French Franc Area and an export license when sold outside that Area. The export of wine is the monopoly of the Office du Vin and the export of cereals is the monopoly of the Office des Cereales. The export of olive oil is the monopoly of the Office National de 1'Huile. With the exception noted below, all export proceeds must be repatriated, normally within 15 days from the date payment is due if no credit is extended. Exporters and hotel owners may have credited to special EFAC (Exportations-Frais Accessoires) accounts denomi- nated either in convertible dinars or in bilateral dinars the equivalent in dinars of a part of their export proceeds. For exporters the limits are 4 per cent if export proceeds are repatriated more than 30 days af ter shipment of the merchan- dise, and 6 per cent if repatriation occurs within 30 days following shipment. For hotel owners, credits are limited to 4 per cent of their foreign exchange proceeds. Under the provisions of Law No. 72-38 of April 27, 1972, nonresident manufac tur ing enterprises (i.e., enterprises whose capital is held by nonresidents and has been consti- tuted to the extent of at least 66 per cent through the import of convertible currencies) producing exclusively for export are exempt from the requirement of repatriation and surrender of export proceeds; this requirement is not applicable to exports to payments agreement countries. Proceeds from Invisibles Residents must repatriate and surrender all amounts de- rived from services rendered to persons resident abroad, in- cluding residents of the French Franc Area, and also all other income or proceeds from invisibles received from countries outside the French Franc Area. However, Tunisian nationals who are work ing abroad may retain the countervalue of their foreign currency earnings in convertible d inar accounts. For- eign banknotes and coins (except gold coins) may be brought in freely; nonresident travelers wishing to re-export the equiv- alent of over D 500 must make a currency declaration upon en try. The import of Tunisian banknotes is prohibited. Capital All nonresidents, including residents of other countries of the French Franc Area, who wish to invest in Tunisia are required to obtain the prior approval of the Tunisian authori- ties in order to secure the guarantee for the transfer of princi- pal of, and current earnings from, such investments. Foreign investment in Tunisia may obtain certain benefits provided for by the Investment Code (Law No. 69-35) of June 26, 1969. These include a number of tax facilities as well as a guarantee of the right to repatriate capital and to transfer profits. Furthermore, Law No. 72-38 of April 27, 1972 pro- vides for various special benefits for nonresident manufactur- ing enterprises, including an exemption from the repatriation requirement in respect of export proceeds. 433 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TUNISIA All foreign nationals who have been residents of Tunisia may upon leaving Tunisia permanently have their domestic bank balances credited to Suspense Accounts; the same ap- plies to all proceeds from the liquidation of foreign invest- ments not covered by a transfer guarantee (e.g., personal real estate). The conversion into foreign exchange of the amounts deposited is normally permitted in accordance w i th rules ap- plied by the Central Bank. All capital transfers by residents require the approval of the Central Bank. The purchase by Tunisian residents of foreign securities on foreign stock exchanges is, in principle, forbidden; in some instances, authorization is granted for a resident to subscribe abroad to a share issue by an enterprise in which he is already a shareholder. Gold Five gold coins issued for commemorative purposes are legal tender. Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Tunisia for num isma t ic purposes. W i th this exception, resi- dents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. By v ir tue of Law No. 63-46 of December 19, 1963, the Central Bank has a monopoly over the import of gold in the form of coins, ingots, or bars. Only dentists and specified cooperatives of industrial users are eligible to purchase gold from the Central Bank. The export of gold is prohibited. Changes during 1973 January 16. Decree No. 73-19 of Janua ry 10, 1973 was published, which regulated the Investment Commission and the Agency for Investment Promotion. January 16. An Order of January 16, 1973 of the M in is try of Finance was published concerning the application of Law No. 72-38, which provided special incentives to export-ori- ented manu fac tu r ing industries. January 16. Central Bank Notice No. 119 of January 1, 1973 was published concerning the application of Law No. 72-38. Among other things, it provided that resident export- ers could open w i th an authorized bank a Business Travel Account in convertible dinars, which could be credited w i th 2 per cent of repatriated export proceeds and could freely be debited for up to D 4,000 a year for business travel outside Tunisia; this privilege could not be combined w i th the EFAC facility of Notice No. 114. The salaries of foreigners employed in the enterprises concerned, if controlled by nonresidents, had to be financed up to at least 50 per cent by credit of the sales proceeds of convertible currencies to an INRE account (compte interieur non-resident exportation)-, resident exporters had to pay such foreigners entirely in dinars, to the credit of an INRE account, but holders could transfer abroad up to 50 per cent of their salaries. January 16. A Central Bank circular was published con- cerning the application of Notice No. 119, including the oper- ation of Business Travel Accounts and the opening of INRE Accounts. Bank loans to nonresidents covered by Law No. 72-38 remained subject to the ruling exchange control regula- tions. January 16. Central Bank Circular No. 73-34 was pub- lished specifying the conditions under which banks could extend credit to enterprises covered by Law No. 72-38. January 26.

Not for Redistribution TURKEY Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.0592447 gram of f ine gold per Turkish Lira, corresponding to LT 15 = SDR 1. The central rate is LT 14 - US$1, equivalent to LT 16.8889 = SDR 1, and Turkey avails itself of wider margins. The official rates for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, are LT 14.000 buy ing, and LT 14.301 selling, per US$1. i The Central Bank also establishes from time to time official buy ing and selling rates for certain other currencies. Pending the enactment of new legislation to eliminate in ter- est payments on remittances by Turkish workers resident abroad, Turkey maintains a separate nominal rate for these, though the resulting effective exchange rate conforms to the central rate of LT 14 per US$1. Workers' remittances are converted at a buy ing rate of LT 10.50 per US$1; 2 when the Turkish lira equivalent is credited to an account w i th a bank in Turkey, the account is immediately credited w i th an addi- tional 33V3 per cent of the amount converted. The official selling rate for exchange provided for expenses connected w i th foreign travel is LT 9.534 per US$1; a tax of 50 per cent (minimum of LT 500) is levied on foreign exchange purchased for most travel purposes, including the cost of transporta- tion. 3 Banks charge their customers LT 10.10 per US$1 for exchange in the form of travelers checks or LT 10.25 per US$1 for cash. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the M in i s t ry of Fi- nance. Trade control is the responsibility of the M in is try of Commerce, which is also in charge of the preparation of import programs. The Ministry, or the Central Bank on the advice of the Ministry, allocates foreign exchange; certain foreign exchange allocations for imports require prior ap- proval of the competent m in is try, even if the commodity is included in the liberalized lists. The Central Bank issues im- port licenses on ins truc t ions of the M in is try of Commerce. Export registration is carried out by professional organiza- tions (the Exporters Union, the Chambers of Commerce, of Indu s t ry, and of Commerce and Indu s t ry) according to the ins truc t ions of the M in is try of Commerce; export licenses are issued by this M in is try, which may delegate the issuance of export licenses to the professional organizations. Import and export licenses for gold, however, are issued by the M in is t ry of Finance. Prescription of Currency and Nonresident Accounts Settlements w i th countries w i th which Turkey has bilateral payments agreements 4 are made in accordance w i th the terms of the relevant agreement, but proceeds from exports 1 Changed on May 14, 1974 to LT 13.50 buy ing, and LT 13.77 selling, per US$1. 2 Changed on May 14, 1974 to LT 10.1252 per US$1. 3 The pa r i ty of LT 9.3333 = US$1 for foreign exchange sales to Tu rk ish tourists was abolished by Decree No. 7 /7872 of February 28, 1974. 4 Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Egyp t, Hunga ry, Poland, and U.S.S.R.

The b i la teral paymen ts agreement w i th Poland expired on April 1, 1974. to these countries may be received in any convertible cur- rency. Certain commercial settlements w i th the other mem- bers of the Regional Cooperation for Development (Iran and Pakistan) are made through special accounts denominated in U.S. dollars. Settlements w i th other countries are made in convertible currencies; proceeds from exports to specified countries in Western Europe must be received in the currency of any coun try in this group. Residents and nonresidents are not permitted to open demand or time accounts in Turkey that are denominated in convertible Turk ish liras. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Rhodesia are prohibited; imports of old, used and reconditioned, defective, substandard, soiled, or poor-quality goods are forb idden, except w i th the authoriza- tion of the M in is t ry of Commerce. All commercial imports require import licenses, which are valid for f ive mon ths, and, generally, goods must be cleared th rough the customs w i th in f ive mon ths. Import licenses are issued to registered import- ers (import merchants), industrialists (manufac turers import- ing for their own needs), state economic enterprises, and government departments. Private individuals and corporate bodies are required to secure an "importer's certificate" issued by the M in i s t ry of Commerce before subm i t t ing applications th rough the authorized banks for licenses to import goods for commercial purposes. The importer's tax status is taken in to consideration when gran t ing such certificates. However, ex- porters, m ine operators, shipowners, bu i ld ing contractors who have under taken the construction of state establish- ments, tourist establishments, and registered manufac turers are not required to secure an "importer's certificate" for im- ports to be used exclusively for their own needs; a certificate establishing their qualification is issued by the respective pub- lic au tho r i ty, i.e., the Chambers of Commerce and Indu s t ry, the Exporters Un ion, or the M in i s t ry of Tourism and In fo r- mation. Most goods are imported in accordance w i th the provisions of import programs, which are planned for one year. The import programs, wh ich inc lude commodities financed w i th funds from the U.S. Agency for In te rna t ional Development (AID), classify impor ts in two categories: (1) an annual list of liberalized goods, consisting of two parts (lists I and II), for which import licenses are issued freely; and (2) a list of goods subject to global quotas published annua l ly. Imports of goods that do not appear on any of these lists are prohib- ited; certain of these commodities, however, may be imported when specifically authorized by the M in is try of Commerce. The list of liberalized goods and the list of global quotas app ly, in principle, only to imports f rom countries other than those w i th which Turkey has bilateral payments agree- ments; 5 goods not included in either of these two import lists may not be imported under the bilateral quotas. For some goods on the liberalized and global quota lists, importers 5 When permitting imports of goods on the liberalized or quota lists f rom nonpaymen ts agreement, non-OECD countries, the M in i s t ry of Commerce takes the balance of trade and paymen ts w i th these countries i n to account. 435 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TURKEY have the option of applying for exchange allocations from U.S. AID funds for orders exceeding US$10,000 in value; there are no goods on these lists, however, that may be im- ported only w i th U.S. AID funds and only from the United States. Certain imports from member countries of the EEC are included in a list of liberalized items consolidated to the EEC and are free of quan t i ta t ive restriction; most of the items on this list are included in liberalized lists I and II, while the remainder is included in the quota list. Applications for import licenses for goods on the liberal- ized lists may be submitted at any time to authorized banks, which transfer them to the M in is try of Commerce (or other public au tho r i ty indicated) for examination and prepare the import licenses and forward these to the Central Bank for approval on the M in is try's instructions. For certain liberal- ized goods, the prior approval of the m in is t ry concerned is also required. There are special arrangements administered by the Minis- try of Commerce to facilitate priority allocation of foreign exchange for imports of raw materials and supplementary materials required for export production. The list of import quotas contains quotas for registered importers and for industrialists. Quotas for industrialists are allocated annua l ly and for importers semiannually. Imports on the quota list can be subdivided in to two broad categories — impor ts which do not, and imports which do, require a permit from a specified public body. Foreign exchange alloca- tions for quota imports w i th in the quan t i ta t ive l im it estab- lished for each quo ta item are made by the Central Bank for impor ts not requiring a permit, and by the M in is try of Com- merce (on the advice of the responsible au tho r i ty) for those requiring a permit. Some of the quota imports also require a certificate conf irm ing that the articles are not manufac tured by local indu s t ry and do not exist in the local market in su f f ic ient qu an t i ty and qua l i ty; the required certificate is the responsibility of the M in is try of Indu s t ry and Technology, which may delegate au tho r i ty to the Chambers of Commerce and Indu s t ry. Registered importers have to submit their applications for goods not requiring a permit th rough an authorized bank and the Central Bank to the M in is t ry of Commerce du r ing the f irst mon th of each semester. No single importer may apply for more than 50 per cent of half of the quota set for any particular commodity; exceptions are possible when this amount does not cover the price of one un i t. Upon examina- tion of applications, the Ministry of Commerce instructs the Central Bank to issue a foreign exchange allocation letter valid for four months, and an import license must be secured f rom the Central Bank w i th in the period of validity of the foreign exchange allocation letter. Applications for imports against industrialists' quotas where no permit is required have to be submitted through the Chambers of Commerce and Indu s t ry to the M in is try of Commerce in April of each year. Applications for quota imports requiring a permit from a specified public au thor i ty must be submitted to the responsi- ble body each semester by importers and each year by indus- trialists. Upon examination of the application, the M in is try 436 of Commerce instructs the responsible body to issue a foreign exchange allocation valid for four mon ths but not longer than one mon th beyond the period of effectiveness of the quota list. An import license must then be secured from the Central Bank dur ing the period of validity of the exchange allocation. Under a system of pre-import price control, which has been suspended but not abolished, imports are to be made at the best ru l ing world market prices. For this purpose, whenever the system is reinstated, a certificate must be obtained from the Office of Price Registration and Control after issuance of the import license or the certificate of foreign exchange alloca- tion. However, public sector imports of goods on liberaliza- tion list I may be authorized by the Central Bank without a price conformity certificate. The import license permits the necessary foreign exchange payment to be made. Payments for imports may be made against letters of credit, documents, or goods (i.e., upon cus- toms clearance). However, for imports financed from U.S. AID funds, 6 payments may be made only against a letter of credit. When the payment is to be made against a letter of credit, registered importers and industrialists are required to prepay in local currency, at the time of application for an import license, the equivalent of the foreign exchange for which they have applied. For payments against documents or against goods (for goods on liberalized list II, the global quota list, and on bilateral quota lists), importers and indus- trialists are required to prepay half of the value of the imports w i th the application for an import license; this requirement has been suspended but not abolished. Importers are required to make the foreign exchange trans- fer w i th in four mon ths from the date of the import license for payments against documents and w i th in two mon ths from the date of customs clearance for payments against goods. Imports from bilateral agreement countries are subject to separate quotas. These are established only for commodities that appear on the liberalization or global quota lists. The import licensing procedure for goods from these countries is the same as for imports under global quotas, except that applications under the bilateral quotas specified in each agreement are submitted by the Central Bank or the responsi- ble public au tho r i ty to the Ministry of Commerce on a mon th ly basis. Guarantee deposits for imports, whether financed from U.S. AID funds or not, are payable in advance, generally as follows: for goods on liberalized list I, 25 per cent of the value of the merchandise is payab le ,7 and for items on list II, 10 per cent; for imports under global quotas, 10 per cent of the value of the import application is payable for goods on im- porters' quotas, and 2.5 per cent for industrialists' quotas and export manufacturers. 8 For imports under bilateral quotas the rate of guarantee deposit depends on the list on which the goods are included if imported from a nonagreement country, but a rate of 10 per cent is applied to quotas which are not 8 The special regime app ly ing to imports financed by the AID was terminated w i th effect from Janua ry 3, 1974. 7 For fertilizers, ammonia, and breeding animals, the rate is 1 per cent. 8 A deposit of 50 per cent applies to items on list I and to items not on any list and not requ ir ing a permit of the M in i s t ry of Commerce, when imported under the Transitional Agreement w i th the EEC; items included in list II and those requiring permission from the M in i s t ry of Commerce when imported under that Agreement require a deposit of 20 per cent. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution included in industrialists' quotas to be fixed by the M in i s t ry of Commerce for agreement countries and all of the quotas indicated in the listed import quo tas for which there exists no control au tho r i ty. Guarantee deposits are payable irrespective of the method of paymen t. The public sector (except for AID imports of some enterprises and ins t i tu t ions in that sector) is exempt, however, and in many cases industrialists make a symbolic deposit of 1 per cent (on imports under investment quotas set aside for their use and applicable to convertible currency countries only), or 10 per cent (on imports under investment quotas in bilateral agreements). An "additional deposit" of 100 per cent is payable for imports on a letter of credit basis, but no "additional deposit" is required for imports on a col- lection basis. For imports to be financed from U.S. AID funds (see foot- note 6), a guarantee payment of 10 per cent, but not to exceed LT 100,000, is payable for imports of the public sector other than central government agencies, irrespective of whether the goods are included in the liberalization list or the quota list. The deposit remains blocked un t il the goods have been cleared through customs and the foreign supplier paid; it is then refunded to the importer. The guarantee deposits col- lected are transferred weekly to an account held by the Cen- tral Bank in the name of the authorized bank. Should imports not be made in conformity with the regulations, a part of the guarantee deposit corresponding to up to 10 per cent of the value of such imports is forfeited to the Treasury. 9 Private compensation transactions are not permitted in any form, except that the M in is try of Commerce is authorized to conclude agreements to dispose of goods acquired th rough suppor t ing purchases made by the State. Impor ts w i thout an allocation of foreign exchange may be permitted by the customs authorities, the Central Bank, or the M in i s t ry of Finance, under certain conditions. Travelers domiciled in Turkey may bring in for personal or professional (but noncommercial) use goods and machinery w i th a l im it of LT 3,000, in addition to personal effects. Separate l im i ts and conditions apply to imports of goods for personal use, and of professional instruments and machines, by persons hav ing resided abroad for employment or study; these limits and conditions vary w i th the stay abroad and with the trans- fer to Turkey of foreign exchange. Companies or cooperatives formed in Turkey by residents temporarily wo rk ing abroad may import inves tment goods to the extent of the foreign exchange invested. In addition to personal effects, foreign 9 The 1974 impo rt program was published on Janua ry 3, 1974. Total impo r ts in 1974 were programed to be US$3,036 m i l l ion, compared w i th US$1,600 m i l l ion for 1973. This included US$1,250 m i l l ion for liberalized goods, US$1,236 m i l l ion for quo ta goods, and US$100 m i l l ion for impo r ts f rom b i la teral agreement countries. A large number of commodities was transferred f rom the global quo ta list to the liberalized lists. The guarantee deposit for impo r ts on liberalized list I was reduced from 25 per cent to 20 per cent, and the ra te was reduced to 1 per cent for the impor ta t ion of tires and tubes, iron and steel, and certain other items. The special regime for impor ts financed by the AID was term ina ted. Impo r ts f rom bilateral paymen ts agreement countries hence fo r th could be made on the basis of cash paymen t, provided th at prior consent was obtained f rom both the Ministries of Commerce and Finance. An emergency quo ta of US$500 a transac t ion was established for impo r ts of goods u r g e n t ly needed by the p r iva te sector. It was also announced t h at f u ll import d u ty exemp t ions on inves tment impo r ts wou ld be phased ou t. All impo r ts under the program could be made on a collection basis (payment against documents or payment aga inst goods). TURKEY tourists may import goods and machinery for their personal or fam i ly use. Foreign contractors may temporarily import machinery, vehicles, and scientific ins t rumen ts w i thout requesting an al- location of foreign exchange, provided that the goods are proved to be necessary for their operations in Turkey and may not be imported on a temporary basis under the relevant customs regulations. Foreign companies established in Tur- key may import spare parts not intended for new investments without requesting an allocation of foreign exchange, pro- vided that the goods are necessary for their operations. All such imports require the permission of the exchange control authorities. Goods imported on these terms must not be sold to th ird parties in Turkey. Import of an automobile 10 without payment of foreign exchange may be permitted by the Central Bank or the Minis- try of Finance, provided that certain conditions are met relat- ing to residence abroad and to remittance and sale to authorized banks in Turkey of foreign exchange. Automobiles imported w i thout a foreign exchange alloca- tion may be sold to residents by the Turkish nationals who have imported them. Foreign diplomats in Turkey may sell their automobiles to Turkish residents provided that the nec- essary import duties are paid at the time of the sale, that Turkish diplomats in the seller's coun try are granted recipro- cal privileges, and that proceeds from such sales are not transferred abroad. Foreign officials, other than diplomats, may not sell to Turkish nationals any automobiles imported d u ty free under special agreements. Other foreign nationals resident in Turkey may import automobiles under certain conditions, but they must be exported af ter three years; how- ever, this three-year period may be extended, and the Minis- try of Finance may also permit the sale of such cars to the State Supply Office or to nonp ro f it organizations. With these exceptions, automobiles and any other commodities that have been imported du ty free may not be sold to residents. In addition to customs du ty, imported goods are subject to the following charges: (1) a customs surcharge of 15 per cent of the applicable customs du ty; (2) a stamp du ty of 9.0 per cent or 9.5 per cent of the declared value, depending on the type of commodity; ll (3) a quay du ty of 5 per cent on the sum of c.i.f. value, customs du ty, customs surcharge, stamp du ty, and customs clearance expenses; and (4) a production tax ranging generally from 10 per cent to 75 per cent on the sum of c.i.f. value, customs du ty, customs surcharge, stamp du ty, customs clearing expenses, and quay du ty. The quay d u ty is not payable on goods imported by air. Payments for Invisibles Paymen ts for invisibles require exchange licenses which usua l ly are issued by the Central Bank. These are granted liberally for the following purposes, provided that applica- tions are accompanied by specified documents: payments re- lated to trade (including shipping costs and expenditures 10 Automobiles are not inc luded in the import program. 11 The s tamp d u ty is 10 per cent for impor ts f rom countries th at are not members of the GATT, and 100 per cent for imports made by special permission but not con fo rm ing to the provisions of the Customs Law, the Foreign Trade Regime, and s im i lar legislation and regulations. 437 ©International Monetary Fund.

The transfer of income related to foreign investments ap- proved under the Law for the Encouragement of Foreign Inves tment is permitted freely. Interest on long-term loans and credits extended by nonresidents to enterprises in Turkey ( inc lud ing those of an agricultural na ture) may be granted transferab i l i ty between foreign nationals both in Turkey and abroad. Turkish citizens are not allowed to leave the coun t ry w i th- out hav ing obtained an allocation of exchange for travel, but this does not app ly to foreign nationals residing in Turkey. Tourist travel is restricted, in effect, to four trips a person a year, except for travel to Cyprus. The allowance of exchange for tourist travel is up to the equivalent of US$800 a calendar year; travelers are not allowed to leave the coun t ry unless they are carrying at least the equivalent of US$200 in foreign exchange (US$110 for persons under 18 years of age, the purchase of this amount not being manda tory). Turkish citi- zens traveling to Cyprus may obtain an exchange allocation equivalent to up to US$400 on request; this does not affect their right to claim the tourist travel allowance. Exchange for business travel is granted w i th in the limits of annual quotas, which vary according to the taxable income of the applicant f irm. For exporting companies, the l im it is related to their export proceeds. Exchange for travel abroad for other pur- poses (e.g., education, participation in international meetings, fairs, athletic meets, and so fo r th, and personal business) is sold up to specified limits. In addition, persons who can certify that it is necessary for them to travel abroad for medi- cal trea tment may purchase the necessary foreign exchange. A tax of 50 per cent (minimum of LT 500) is payable on the purchase against payment in Turkish liras of tickets for foreign travel, and on baggage charges. The LT 500 m in imum is not applicable to Turkish citizens leaving to work abroad. Travelers are permitted to take out LT 100 in Turk ish banknotes and coins. Nonresidents may take out w i thout any restriction the unspent portion of the foreign exchange which they brought in. Nonresident travelers who wish to reconvert Turkish liras in to foreign currency when leaving the coun t ry are required to present a document showing that foreign exchange had previously been sold to an authorized dealer in Turkey. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Rhodesia are prohibited. All exports destined to bilateral countries, 12 exports of a few commodities to any destination, 13 re-exports irrespective of destination, and tem- 12 Expor ts of specified perishables to these countries are authorized by the customs offices; export licenses must be delivered to customs w i t h in f ive days of expor t. 13 Cereals, certain minerals such as mo lybdenum, wo l f ram, and iron ore, articles made of precious metals or stones, vegetable oils, oilseeds, skins, fertilizers, cattle, meat, and t imbe r. 438 porary exports require an export license in order to prevent re-exports and to assure adequate supplies for the domestic market. Commercial export prices must conform to the checklist of prices fixed at intervals by the M in is try of Com- merce on the basis of prices obtaining in domestic and foreign markets. For this purpose, exporters must apply for price registration to a professional organization designated by the M in is t ry of Commerce w i th in f ive working days (three work- ing days in the case of hazelnuts) of a sale, 14 together w i th a statement of income earned and income and corporation taxes paid during the last three years. The professional orga- nization will not accept for registration applications not con- fo rm ing to the checklist of prices. When registering sales, due consideration is given to delivery time, quan t i ty, sales condi- tions, the income earned by the exporter on his commercial activities in the course of the last three years, and income and corporation taxes assessed dur ing the same period. For exports requiring a license, the price registration appli- cation is submitted by the responsible au thor i ty to the Minis- try of Commerce; approved price registration bills constitute export licenses. Exporters in the public sector may apply direct to the M in is t ry of Commerce for price registration and export licenses. In issuing licenses for exports to bilateral agreement countries, export quotas are fixed by the Ministry. Exports must be started w i th in 30 to 180 days of registration, depending on the type of goods, sales contracts, and country of designation. Circulation certificates for exports to member countries of the EEC benefiting from preferential customs and tax trea tment are issued by the Customs Au tho r i ty. Exporters are required to sell to a bank in Turkey the foreign exchange proceeds of goods exported w i th in three mon ths from the date of export or w i th in ten days f rom the date on which the foreign exchange is placed at their disposal. They are permitted to export a specified list of commodities on nine-month credit terms, however, against payment in convertible currency and subject to a bank guarantee. For- ward sales may be made on ly when payment is to be received in convertible currencies; price con fo rm i ty for forward sales is required at the time the export contract is concluded. Under an export tax rebate scheme, direct and indirect taxes paid are refunded when manufactures or products are exported. There are basically four rates of refund: 5, 10, 20, and 25 per cent of specified direct and indirect taxes. How- ever, 10 percentage points more in tax refunds is granted to exporters who sell more than US$1.2 million of goods benefit- ing from a re fund.

In addition, vary ing provisional rates of re fund exist. The tax refund must not exceed the amount of indirect taxes and charges actually paid.

Proceeds from Invisibles Firms or individuals not in the category of authorized insti- tu t ions cannot accept more than the equivalent of US$100 from foreign tourists and are required to surrender any ex- change earnings in the form of foreign banknotes and travel- ers checks to an authorized bank within ten days. Otherwise, foreign exchange accruing to residents for services rendered by them to nonresidents must be surrendered to an autho- rized exchange dealer within three months from the date on which the service was rendered or w i th in ten days from the date of acquisition of the exchange. Remittances from Turk- ish workers abroad are sold to the Central Bank at LT 10.50 per U.S. dollar (but see footnote 2); when the Turkish lira equivalent is credited to a bank account in Turkey, an addi- tional amount of 33 V3 per cent is immediately credited to the account representing three years' interest at 11.11 per cent per annum resulting in an effective exchange rate of LT 14.00 per U.S. dollar. 1S The amounts deposited plus the interest can be w i thdrawn at any time. Foreign travelers wishing to take out articles with a value exceeding LT 2,000 must show proof that they have converted foreign exchange to cover the portion of the cost exceeding this limit. The import of Turkish banknotes and coins by travelers (whether of Turkish or foreign nationality) is limited to LT 100. The import of foreign currency by travelers is unre- stricted. Capital Foreign investments in Turkey require approval. Capital transfers abroad by residents and capital transactions be- tween residents and nonresidents are subject to the approval of the exchange control authorities. Residents are not nor- mally permitted to acquire foreign securities or real estate. With the exception of certain investments made in accor- dance with the provisions of the Law for the Encouragement of Foreign Investments (No. 6224) or the Petroleum Law (No. 6326, as amended), foreign companies and contractors who wish to do business in Turkey must import the required capital and operating funds in the form of foreign exchange, although under certain conditions blocked funds may be used for investment in the tourist industry as well as certain other industries. Borrowing in Turkish liras by such foreign compa- nies and contractors is subject to quotas set by the Ministry of Finance in accordance with their equity capital in Turkey, but special facilities exist for borrowing from the "Blocked Currencies Fund" at the Central Bank. Blocked funds are those accrued or accruing to nonresi- dents but not transferable under the existing exchange con- trol regulations. These include the sales proceeds of real estate situated in Turkey and owned by nonresident physical or juridical persons, insofar as the property is not covered by Law No. 6224 or Law No. 6326. Except for approved invest- ments, nonresidents may not convert into foreign currency 15 Changed on May 14, 1974 to LT 13.50 per US$1. TURKEY any assets or balances owned by them, or earnings accruing to them; all earnings are blocked but if, at the end of the calendar year, such earnings are less than LT 10,000, the amount involved is deblocked. Subject to individual permis- sion, blocked assets and balances may be utilized w i th in Tur- key, e.g., for the payment of taxes, insurance, and maintenance and repair of property; and for l iv ing expenses of up to LT 9,000 a mon th for each beneficiary for owners of such funds or their authorized representatives, and up to LT 5,000 for certain relatives. Normally, such blocked funds may not be transferred to others except by legal succession. The investment of blocked funds in the tourist indus t ry is subject to the following conditions: (1) there must be a contri- bution in new foreign exchange or imported equipment equal to at least 50 per cent of the blocked funds to be used and (2) the investor must undertake not to request transfer for at least f ive years of that part of the capital financed by means of the blocked funds. Blocked funds used in this manner are consid- ered as foreign capital imported under the Law for the En- couragement of Foreign Investments. A portion of 75 per cent of any holder's blocked funds can be transferred to the Blocked Currencies Fund at the Central Bank, from which nonresidents may receive credits for their partner companies' investment requirements in Turkey, pro- vided the permission of the Ministry of Finance is obtained. Dividends and profits derived from these credits have to be blocked again and are nontransferrable. Balances on nonresident accounts established at the Cen- tral Bank in accordance w i th the Paris Agreement on Com- mercial Debts Owed by Residents of Turkey (1959) may be used either partially or who l ly by the creditors for investment or to pay expenses in Turkey at any time prior to the date, established under the Agreement, when the balances may be transferred. The use of these balances for investment purposes is subject to the provisions of the Law for the Encouragement of Foreign Investments. However, invested funds and income related thereto may not be transferred abroad before the transfer date established under the Agreement, except for investment in the export industries or in other industries earning foreign exchange; in such instances the equivalent of up to 25 per cent of the investment may be transferred annu- ally. Foreign capital invested in Turkey under the terms of the Law for the Encouragement of Foreign Investments is ac- corded preferential treatment, provided that the enterprise in which the investment is to be made is deemed to contribute to the economic development of the country, or will operate in a field of activity open to Turkish private enterprise and will not entail monopoly or special privilege. Under this law, all or part of the invested capital or foreign loans may be remitted abroad in the original currency of the capital. Upon application, the M in is try of Finance guarantees the transfer of dividends and of the proceeds from the sale or liquidation of shares or stock certificates registered on the books of com- panies established under the law. Such registered shares or stock certificates are freely transferable between foreign na- tionals, both in Turkey and abroad, and between foreign nationals and residents. The transfer guarantees pass on to 439 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TURKEY the new owner, provided that his name is notified to the M in is try of Finance; if the shares or stock certificates are sold to a resident, however, they must be presented to the M in i s t ry of Finance for cancellation of the guarantees. The capital and interest on long-term loans and credits extended by nonresi- dents to enterprises in Turkey (including those of an agricul- tural character) may be accorded the same transfer benefits. Foreign capital imported under the Petroleum Law is ac- corded additional preferential treatment. By v i r tue of a policy statement of December 1971, Turkish participation in new foreign investments no longer is subject to a m in imum of 51 per cent. In addition to investments under Law No. 6224, foreign investments outside the petroleum sector may be made "under the mone tary regulations," in which case the investor does not enjoy any t rans fer facilities for earnings or l iqu ida t ion proceeds. Transactions in securities, inc lud ing their export and im- port, require approval when nonresident interests are in- volved. Nonresidents are permitted to open noninterest-bearing foreign exchange deposit accounts w i th Turkish banks. Non- residents can no longer open or credit demand accounts in convertible Turkish liras, a l though existing balances can be maintained. The deadlines for the termination of time depos- its in convertible Turkish liras varies between Ju ly 2, 1973 and April 3, 1976, depending on the end-use of the counter- part domestic bank credit. However, time deposits w i th ma- tu r i ty dates going beyond the deadlines specified for the d ifferent end-uses of the counterpart domestic bank credit are permitted to run their fu ll term. No exchange guarantee exists for demand deposits af ter April 3, 1973 and for time deposits af ter the original ma tu r i ty date. Banks have been granted certain general permissions al- lowing them to borrow convertible currencies from nonresi- dents for relending to nonresidents. The total amount of private and public sector borrowing abroad from private sources, inc lud ing supplier credits, is determined in an annual program by the M in is t ry of Finance, which also specifies the eligible sectors and projects. The M in is t ry of Finance, af ter consultation w i th other ministries if appropriate, is authorized to approve such credits and to issue a guarantee of the transferab i l i ty of the foreign ex- change. It is up to the intermediating bank to guarantee the repayment in lira. Turkish borrowers pay that bank the pre- vailing domestic interest rate; the excess over the interest rate payable to the foreign lender, net of a bank ing commission, is credited to an "Interest Equalization Fund'* established in the Central Bank. Regulations issued by the M in is try of Fi- nance specify tha t, w i th certain exceptions, such credits must not amount to more than 60 per cent of the total cost of a project, their ma tu r i ty must not be less than two years, and the rate of interest must not exceed the Euro-dollar rate (LIBOR rate) by more than 1 per cent. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Turkey for num isma t ic purposes. W i th this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized indus tr ial users 440 are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad; any unworked gold held in Tur- key, however, may be presented for m in t ing by the State M in t. Impor ts and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require licenses issued by the M in is try of Finance; such licenses are not normally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and in- dustrial users. Changes during 1973 January 1. The additional protocol signed between Turkey and the EEC on November 23, 1970 came into force. Some of its provisions had already been put in to effect by virtue of a provisional agreement on September 1, 1971. The financial protocol under which the EEC would contribute to the devel- opment of the Turkish economy through the European In- vestment Bank also came in to force. January 1. The reduced rates of stamp du ty of 9 per cent and 9.5 per cent, depending on the type of commodity, were made applicable to imports from all contracting parties to the GATT. Previously, they were applied only to goods imported under the Provisional Agreement w i th the EEC, while the rate was 10 per cent for imports from other sources. January 3. More restrictive directives for the approval of new inward direct investment came into force. Subsequently, domestic bank credit (against convertible currency deposits held in Turkey) to firms whose head offices are located abroad was suspended. January 3. Foreign physical and juridical persons not resi- dent or established in Turkey could no longer open or credit demand accounts in convertible Turkish liras, although exist- ing balances could be maintained; with effect from April 3, 1973 such foreign persons would have to liquidate their time deposits maintained in convertible Turkish liras. However, nonresidents now were permitted to open noninterest-bearing foreign exchange deposit accounts with Turkish banks. January 3. Regulations were issued governing private and public sector borrowing abroad from private sources, for spe- cific investment projects and through the intermediary of banks in Turkey (Decree No. 7/5399). (Excluded were credits to the Republic of Turkey from foreign governments and government agencies and from international agencies.) The max imum total amount of such borrowing in any calendar year, as well as the sectors and projects eligible for it, would be specified in an Annual Program. The Ministry of Finance, af ter consultation w i th other ministries if appropriate, was authorized to approve such credits and to issue a guarantee of the transferab i l i ty of the foreign exchange. It would be the responsibility of the intermediating bank to guarantee the repayment in lira. Turkish borrowers would pay the bank prevailing domestic interest rates; the excess over the interest rate payable to the foreign lender would be credited (after deduction of the banking commission, which could not ex- ceed 1 percentage point) to an "Interest Equalization Fund" to be established in the Central Bank and to be used to provide low interest credit to priority projects. In a com- mun ique, the Ministry of Finance specified tha t, with certain exceptions, such credits could not exceed 60 per cent of the ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution amount of any project, the ma tur i ty could not be less than two years, and the rate of interest could not exceed the Euro-dollar rate by more than 1 per cent. January 4. The 1973 import program was published, repre- senting some fu r th er liberalization of the import system. To- tal imports in 1973 were programmed to be US$1,600 million, wh ich included US$720 million for liberalized goods, US$450 million for quota goods, and US$115 million for imports from bilateral agreement countries. The three main import lists were considerably revised, particularly by the transfer of inves tment goods from the quota list to liberaliza- tion list II. Some of the revisions were designed to make the import regime conform to the liberalization list consolidated to the EEC. Import guarantee deposit rates were reduced f rom 40 per cent to 20 per cent for liberalization list II, f rom 25 per cent to 20 per cent for importers' quotas under the quota list, and from 10 per cent to 5 per cent for industrial- ists' quotas under the quota list. Commodities on liberaliza- t ion list II and on all import quo ta lists were permitted, subject to an additional deposit of 50 per cent, to be imported on payment against goods or payment against documents terms; formerly they could only be imported under letters of credit. The ratio of import quotas exempt from processing of applications by an official body was increased from 20 per cent to 50 per cent of total quota allocations. January 24. The exchange rate applied to proceeds from tobacco exports was changed from LT 13 to LT 14 per US$1. February 1. The l im it applying to the free importation by travelers domiciled in Turkey of goods and machinery (in addition to personal effects) for personal or professional (but noncommercial) use was raised from LT 2,500 to LT 3,000. February 16. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Turkey maintained its central rate unchanged at LT 14 = US$1 and continued to avail itself of wider margins. The special exchange rate of LT 13 = US$1 applying to seven traditional export products was continued, but the Government announced its decision to abolish it effec t ive August 1, 1973 and instead to apply un i fo rm ly the central rate of LT 14 = US$1. February 16. The rates of rebate under the export tax rebate scheme were changed from 10, 15, 25, 30, 35, and 40 per cent of specified direct and indirect taxes to 5, 10, 20, 25, 30, and 35 per cent. March 5. The Central Bank suspended transactions in the fo l low ing currencies: Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, deutsche mark, French francs, Netherlands guilders, and Swiss francs. Transactions were resumed on March 21. March 5. Turkey imposed a temporary ban on imports of commodities for which payment was stipulated in Austrian schillings, deutsche mark, French francs, Netherlands guil- ders, or Swiss francs. This ban was l if ted on March 21. March 23. The deadline for the termination of convertible lira time deposit accounts (previously set at April 3, 1973) was extended to different dates depending on the end-use of the counterpart domestic bank credit, as follows: credits to finance fixed investments for sectors included in the General Encouragement Table in the 1973 Annual Program —April 3, 1976; operational credits for sectors included in the General Encouragement Table in the 1973 Annual Program —April 3, TURKEY 1975; credits for investments in sectors not included in the General Encouragement Table —April 3, 1974; all other cred- its —July 2, 1973. Credits so extended would not be permitted to be changed in to another type of credit un t il the expiry of the extended term. However, time deposits with maturity dates going beyond the dates specified above in relation to d ifferent types of domestic end-use, were permitted to run their fu ll term. The exchange guarantee that had previously been in effect was w i thdrawn from demand deposits effective April 3, 1973 and from time deposits after the expiry of their existing term, i.e., time deposits extended in accordance with regulations issued on March 23, 1973 would cease to have an exchange guarantee for the extended part of the term. The net effect of this series of measures was to give the authorities greater selective control over the end-use of this type of external borrowing, to phase out the exchange guaran- tee, and to facilitate a gradual reduction in the total amount of convertible lira deposits. March 31. The bilateral payments agreement w i th Roma- nia expired. April 18. A law came in to force revising the regulations for the petroleum indus t ry. It provided for a priority position for the state-owned petroleum company, TPAO, and established a new agency, the Turkish Petroleum Directorate, to control all oil operations and oversee crude imports. June 14. The regulations regarding the deblocking and the utilization w i th in Turkey of blocked assets and balances were eased. June 19. The export regime for 1973 was announced. Ex- ports of cattle and fresh, chilled, or frozen beef, as well as exports of timber, were made subject to licensing. June 30. A supplementary protocol to the Association Agreement between the EEC and Turkey, consequent on the accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Denmark to the EEC, was signed. It came in to force on January 1, 1974 and made these three countries parties to the Association Agreement between the EEC and Turkey. July 2. Guarantee deposits for imports were reduced as follows: for goods on liberalized list I from 50 per cent to 25 per cent of the value of the merchandise; for goods on liberal- ized list II from 20 per cent to 10 per cent; for imports under global quotas, from 20 per cent to 10 per cent for goods on importers' quotas and from 5 per cent to 2.5 per cent for industrialists' quotas and export manufacturers. Moreover, payments for imports on liberalized list I were permitted to be made also against documents or goods, while previously letters of credit were obligatory. July 12. Foreign exchange allocations for various types of current invisibles were increased. Turkish citizens were al- lowed to make tourist trips abroad several times a year (in effect four times) instead of once a year, and the exchange allocation for this purpose was increased from US$400 to US$800 a person a calendar year. Special permits no longer were required to employ the services of foreign technicians and experts. Foreign currency allocations henceforth were made available not only for freight charges in connection with the transportation of goods by sea but also for expenditures connected with other freight charges. 441 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution TURKEY August L The special exchange rate of LT 13 per US$1 app ly ing to export proceeds from seven traditional products, inc lud ing raw cotton, was eliminated. August 7. Authorized banks suspended temporarily all dealings in U.S. dollars other than small transactions w i th travelers. The suspension was terminated on August 29. August 17. The prescription of currency rules for exports were changed as follows: Exports to Austria, Belgium, Den- mark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, I ta ly, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom had to be paid for either in the currency of the impor t ing coun t ry or in the currency of any other coun t ry in this group. Exports to other countries w i th which no pay- ments agreement was in force had to be paid for either in U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars, or in any of the currencies of the countries indicated in the previous sentence. Payment for exports to countries w i th which bilateral paymen ts agree- ments were in force had to be received either th rough the appropriate clearing account or in any convertible currency. Previously, proceeds from exports to any nonclearing coun t ry could be received in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, or any other convertible currency. August 24. Supplier credits from abroad were made subject to regulations corresponding to those introduced on Janu- ary 3, 1973 for pr iva te and public borrowing abroad f rom private sources. August 25. A package of economic policy measures was introduced to ease domestic price pressures. A supp lemen tary quota of US$250 million was announced for imports of goods in short supply. Exports of some agricultural products were prohibited, while exports of other agricultural products and of syn the t ic yarn and fibers were made subject to export licensing. For a number of commodities ( inc lud ing cement, lumber, margarine, sunflower-seed oil, cottonseed oil, an imal feed, and cereals), it was ruled that domestic requirements would take priority over export considerations and that they could be subjected to export restrictions. The tax rebate ra- tios were lowered for several export products. Import du ty reductions or exemptions were announced for a number of goods, inc lud ing cereals and wool. Moreover, the additional deposit of 50 per cent was abol- ished that previously was applicable to goods on liberalized list II, on the global quo ta list, and on quo ta lists established w i th bilateral agreement countries, when such goods were imported on the basis of payment against goods or payments against documents. August 25. The pre- import price control system was abol- ished. The post-import price registration remained in force. August 25. The M in is try of Finance was authorized by Decree No. 7 /6577 to determine the parity between the Turk- ish lira and the U.S. dollar; this parity would henceforth be the pa r i ty basis of the Turkish currency. Subsequently the par i ty was fixed at LT 14 = US$1, i.e., the existing central rate. September 9. A decree was issued providing an exchange risk guarantee as follows: If goods covered by a license or a registration certificate issued in accordance w i th the export regulations were effectively exported w i th in 45 days of the date of issue, the purchase of the foreign exchange proceeds would be made at the rate of exchange in force on the issue date of the license or the registration certificate, even if lower than the rate prevailing on the date of shipment. October 12. A number of measures were introduced modi- fy ing the export tax rebate scheme. Thus, fru i ts and vegeta- bles were included in the scheme, w i th rates of rebate ranging f rom 5 per cent to 15 per cent. October 13. A "Blocked Currencies Fund" was established at the Central Bank. Each nonresident holder of blocked liras could t rans fer 75 per cent of these liras to the new Fund. Subject to prior permission from the M in is t ry of Finance, the nonresidents concerned could receive credits from the Blocked Currencies Fund to f inance their own investment requirements in Turkey or those of their affiliates in Turkey. Interest rates on such credits were to be the prevailing rates for domestic bank credit in Turkey. Dividends and profits derived from investments financed w i th these credits would be non transferab le and were to be credited to blocked lira accounts. Previously, blocked liras could only be used for investments in the tourist indu s t ry in Turkey or for personal expenditures in Turkey. November 23. Exchange allocations for s tudy abroad were increased. November 28. The m in imum reserve requirements on short-term deposits ( inc lud ing those held by nonresidents) were increased from 25 per cent to 30 per cent. December 4. The M in i s t ry of Finance issued implementing regulations relating to the use of the Blocked Currencies Fund. Applications for credits had to be made to the Ministry of Finance w i th in one mon th of the date on which the funds were credited to a blocked account. Prior to the application, the part of the balance that exceeded the portion to be used as a credit must be deposited in a Provisional Blocked Ac- count opened w i th the Central Bank. Accrued interest had to be deposited in the Blocked Currencies Fund w i th in 15 days. 442 ©International Monetary Fund.

A central rate of U Sh 6.90000 = US$1 has been established, and Uganda avails itself of wider margins. l The Bank of Uganda does not deal in foreign currencies 2 other than sterling, U.S. dollars, and deutsche mark; its rates for the U.S. dollar are based on the central rate, and its rates for sterling and deut- sche mark are based on the previous day's New York rates against the U.S. dollar. On December 31, 1973, the Bank's buy ing and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were U Sh 6.8978 and U Sh 6.9044, respectively. Authorized commercial banks in Uganda deal in all specified currencies 3 and base their rates on the previous day's closing rates against the U.S. dollar in London, except for Kenya shillings and Tanzania shillings, which are dealt in at par. Authorized banks may freely deal forward w i th customers in sterling, U.S. dollars, and other currencies, provided that there is an unde r ly ing approved import or export contract and that the term of the forward contract does not exceed three mon ths; contracts for longer periods require exchange control approval. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Bank of Uganda on behalf of the Minister of Finance. Impo rt and export control is administered by the M in is t ry of Commerce and Indu s t ry under the External Trade Act and by the Bank of Uganda. The Minister of Commerce and Indu s t ry has powers to prohibit imports and exports.

Transfers between Blocked Accounts in Uganda, and to Blocked Accounts in Kenya and Tanzania, require prior approval. All Blocked Accounts must be held w i th the Uganda Commercial Bank. Imports and Import Payments All permitted imports require approval by the Bank of Uganda. Mon th ly allocations of foreign exchange for imports are limited to a total of U Sh 100 million. Some imports from all sources are prohibited for reasons of public policy; imports prohibited for other reasons include passenger automobiles, cotton fabrics, blankets, electrical home refrigerators, transis- tor radios, and matches. All imports from Israel, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited and imports from Por- tuguese-controlled territories in Africa are not being licensed. Impo r ts norma l ly must be purchased direct from the coun t ry of origin. Some imports of manufac tured goods f rom Kenya and Tanzania are subject to transfer taxes. Documentary evidence showing that the goods have been imported in to Uganda must be forwarded to the exchange control authorities w i th in six mon ths from the date of pay- men t. Payments for nonessential imports are normally made a f ter arrival of the goods, but advance payment is permitted for essential goods. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to all countries are subject to ap- proval by the Bank of Uganda and those to Portugal (and its overseas territories), Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohib- ited.

The allowance is available for travel to any coun try except Kenya and Tanza- nia, for which normally holiday facilities of up to U Sh 500 a person a year are available, and Israel, Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa, for which no allocation is granted. Salaried noncitizens recruited f rom outside East Africa may obtain allocations for travel outside East Africa at the time of their overseas leave. No foreign exchange is released for nursery, primary, and secondary education abroad except for children of diplomats, technical assistance personnel, nonnationals work ing in Uganda on overseas terms, nonna t ional missionaries, and 444 other special cases. Facilities exist whereby salaried foreign nationals may dur ing their stay in Uganda remit to their coun try of origin up to 33V3 per cent of their gross monthly earnings, to cover fam i ly maintenance, savings, etc., provided that they are on a contract of employment which includes a f i rm commitment to leave Uganda upon expiry of the con- tract. The export of Uganda banknotes and coins by travelers is prohibited, except that travelers to Kenya and Tanzania may take out U Sh 100 in Uganda currency. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports require licenses and may be restricted to ensure sufficient supplies for consumption in Uganda. All exports to Israel, South Africa, the Portuguese-controlled territories in Africa, and Rhodesia are prohibited. The State Trading Cor- poration has a monopoly over the export of edible oils. Export proceeds in specified currencies (see footnote 3) must be collected w i th in six mon ths of exportation and of- fered to an authorized bank in Uganda for conversion into Uganda shillings. Coffee, cotton, and hides and skins are subject to export du ty. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in specified currencies (see foot- note 3) must be sold to an authorized bank. The import of Uganda banknotes and coins by travelers is prohibited, ex- cept that returning Ugandan residents may bring in U Sh 100 a person. Travelers may freely bring in foreign currency notes and foreign currency travelers checks. Capital Capital transfers to all countries are restricted and those to Israel, Portugal (and its overseas territories), Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. Residents of Uganda, however, may be granted exemptions from the deposit and surrender requirements in respect of foreign assets for specified Sterling Area assets held prior to June 11, 1965. Capital transfers require individual exchange control ap- proval. Residents of Uganda leaving permanently may nor- mally transfer their assets up to the equivalent of U Sh 50,000. The allowance is reduced by the amount of insurance premi- ums remitted after 1965 outside the facilities for remit- tance of savings. A fu r ther transfer of up to the equivalent of U Sh 20,000 upon each anniversary of the emigrant's depar- ture is allowed. All remaining funds must be credited to a Blocked Account and may either be invested in certain ap- proved securities or held on deposit with the Uganda Com- mercial Bank in Uganda; such funds become transferable after f ive years. The income from such investments is transfer- able also during the period when the funds are blocked. There is no restriction on the investment of foreign funds in Uganda; to secure guaranteed repatriation, however, it is necessary to obtain "approved status" for the investment in terms of the Foreign Investments (Protection) Act, 1964, which in normal circumstances is given freely. Foreign and domestic investment in specified types of production require ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution approval under the East African Industrial Licensing Act and the Uganda Licensing Act, 1969. Dividends and profits due to nonresidents from normal trading operations and distrib- uted by companies operating in Uganda are in principle trans- ferable. All imports and exports of securities require approval. Ap- proval is freely granted for the purchase by nonresidents of Ugandan securities, provided that payment is received in an appropriate manner. The income from such securities is re- mittable, and the proceeds on resale are normally remittable also. Purchases of securities outside Uganda by residents are not normally permitted. A resident of Uganda may not send, as a gift, to any country more than U Sh 100 a year without specific exchange control approval. With minor exceptions, prior exchange control approval is required for loans or overdraft facilities granted to a nonresi- dent or to a body corporate resident in Uganda which is by any means controlled, whether directly or indirectly, by per- sons resident outside Uganda. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Uganda for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial and professional users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in Uganda in any form other than jewelry. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry constituting the per- sonal effects of a traveler require licenses issued by the Minis- try of Finance. Export licenses are not normally granted except for exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. The import of the following from all sources is subject to individual licensing: jewelry of gold, silver, or platinum; goldsmiths' or silversmiths' wares, includ- ing set gems; bullion in the ingot, bar, or sheet; and gold coins. Import licenses for gold bullion (ingots, bars, or sheets), gold jewelry, and gold coins are issued to goldsmiths only and are issued restrictively. Changes during 1973 January 1. With effect from this date, all Blocked Accounts UGANDA had to be transferred to the state-owned Uganda Commercial Bank (UCB), and all government departments, urban author- ities, state boards, and similar bodies receiving government aid were required to bank with the UCB and to place their insurance business with the National Insurance Corporation. The requirement of banking with the UCB was revoked on December 6. January 1. East African shillings ceased to be accepted by the Bank of Uganda and the authorized banks for exchange at par into Uganda shillings. February. The payments agreement signed by the Bank of Zaire and the Bank of Uganda on August 29, 1972 came in to operation. February 18. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Uganda changed its par value from 0.114592 gram to 0.103133 gram of f ine gold per Uganda shilling. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar remained unchanged at U Sh 7.14286 = US$1. The relationship to the Kenya shilling and the Tanzania shilling also remained unchanged. Uganda continued to avail itself of wider margins. February 22. A temporary import ban was introduced for certain nonessential consumer goods which are also produced locally and passenger automobiles. Severe restrictions on im- ports of other goods were introduced. March 13. The exchange rate for the U.S. dollar was pegged at U Sh 7.0000 = US$1. April. The requirement that all imports originating in the People's Republic of China must be effected by the State Trading Corporation was revoked. April 30. Statutory Instrument No. 58 amended the Proper- ties and Businesses (Acquisition) Decree, 1972 (Decree 32) so as to permit the Government to acquire additional foreign-owned companies. July 2. Uganda established a central rate of U Sh 6.90000 = US$1, equivalent to 0.106763 gram of fine gold per Uganda shilling and corresponding to U Sh 8.32377 = SDR 1.

No par value for the dirham has yet been established w i th the Fund. The United Arab Emirates Currency Board establishes daily quotations for the deutsche mark, the pound sterling, the Swiss franc, and the U.S. dollar; these quotations are derived from the previous day's closing U.S. dollar-sterling rate in London. The Board deals w i th commercial banks only. Administration of Control There is neither exchange control legislation nor an ex- change control au tho r i ty in the United Arab Emirates, and there are no registration requirements for inward or ou tward transfers. The United Arab Emirates has ceased to be a Scheduled Territory in terms of the U.K. Exchange Control Act, 1947 but under current U.K. exchange control regula- tions continues to be regarded as a coun try of the Overseas Sterling Area. Import and export licenses, where required, are issued by the authorities of the Emirate concerned. Prescription of Currency All settlements w i th Israel are prohibited. No other pre- scription of currency requirements are in force. Nonresident Accounts No distinction is made between accounts held by residents and those held by nonresidents. Exports to Israel are prohibited. Exports of petroleum from Abu Dhabi and Dubai to the Netherlands and the United States have been suspended. V i r tua l ly all other com- modities may be exported freely, w i thout an export license, to any other destination; each Emirate establishes its own export regulations. There are no requirements attached to receipts f rom exports or re-exports; the proceeds need not be repatriated or surrendered, and they may be disposed of freely, regardless of the currency involved. Proceeds from Invisibles There are no requirements attached to receipts from cur- rent invisibles. Travelers may br ing in any amount in foreign or domestic banknotes. Capital No exchange control requirements are imposed on capital receipts or payments by residents or nonresidents. Transac- tions and settlements invo lv ing Israel, however, are prohib- i ted.

Gold Residents and nonresidents, inc lud ing private persons, may freely and w i thout license purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form, at home or abroad. They may also, w i thout a license and w i thout payment of any customs du ty or tax, impo rt and export gold in any form. Transactions invo lv ing Israel, however, are prohibited. Imports and Import Payments Changes during 1973 Imports from Israel, Rhodesia, and South Africa are pro- hibited, as are imports of products manufac tured by foreign companies blacklisted by the Arab League. Impor ts of a few commodities are prohibited from all sources for moral, health, or security reasons.

The United Arab Emirates Currency Board started operations. May 18. The United Kingdom ceased to issue annual guidelines to commercial banks in the United Arab Emirates w i th respect to settlements w i th nonresidents of the Sterling Area. These guidelines had involved a distinction between ou twa rd payments eligible for settlement in sterling at the official rate of exchange and those not so eligible, and a request to ensure that expatriates' salary remittances were limited to 75 per cent of net earnings. May 19. A new currency un i t, the d irham, was issued to replace the Bahrain d inar and the Qa ta r /Dubai riyal. These two currencies ceased to be legal tender in the United Arab Emirates on November 18 and August 18, 1973, respectively. May 19.

Since June 23, 1972, however, the authorities have not maintained the exchange rate of the pound w i th in announced margins, and therefore all transactions in the official exchange market, except those in currencies ma in ta in ing a fixed relationship w i th sterling, take place at a f luc tua t ing exchange rate. The closing selling and buy ing rates in the foreign exchange mar- ket for the U.S. dollar on December 31, 1973 were US$2.3232 and US$2.3237 per £1, respectively. Authorized banks are allowed to engage in spot and for- ward exchange transactions in any currencies, except Rhode- sian currency, subject to the observance of l im i ts on open positions and the accumulation of spot foreign exchange. Forward rates may f luc tua te under the influence of market forces; transactions w i th resident customers may be entered in to only for approved purposes, where there is an unde r ly ing commercial contract (or where an exporter is tendering for an overseas export contract), and in the currency of the contract. There is also a market in which the foreign currency pro- ceeds 1 (referred to as investment currency) resulting ma in ly from the sale outside the Scheduled Territories (the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, the Republic of I re land ,2 and Gibraltar) of foreign currency securities,3 of direct investments held in non-EEC non-Scheduled Territo- ries outside the Overseas Sterling Area (but see footnote 14), and of most personal residential property situated outside the Scheduled Territories may be negotiated at freely determined rates, usually a t trac t ing a premium over the official market rate (but see footnote 14); at the end of 1973, that premium was about 39V2 per cent calculated at £1 = US$2.60, or about 241/2 per cent calculated at the ru l ing U.S. dollar rate in the official exchange market, the middle closing rate on Decem- ber 31 being £1 = US$1.8671. These funds are available for reinvestment in marketable foreign currency securities, for approved purchases of personal residential property in countries outside the Scheduled Territories other than Rho- desia, and for approved direct investments in non-Scheduled Territories outside the Overseas Sterling Area (but see foot- note 14). The authorized banks may deal among themselves and w i th residents and nonresidents in foreign notes and coins (other than Rhodesian currency) at free market rates of ex- change. The Un i ted Kingdom forma l ly accepted the obligations of Article V I I I, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement, as f rom February 15, 1961. 1 Under the U .K. exchange con trol regulations, foreign cu r rency comprises all currencies o ther than the currencies of the Un i ted K ingdom, the Repub l ic of I re land, and G ibra l tar. 2 The U .K. regulations refer to Ire land as the Repub l ic of Ire land, and for the purpose of th is survey the U .K. usage is being followed. 3 The term "foreign currency securities" in th is survey is generally to be read as mean ing securities payable or op t iona l ly payable in a currency of a coun t ry o ther th an the Un i ted K ingdom, the Repub l ic of Ireland, and G ibra l tar. Special regulations, however, are applicable to foreign currency securities payable in Rhodesian currency. S ter l ing securities are defined as securities payable solely in s ter l ing, Irish pounds, or G ibra l tar currency. The term "securities" includes certificates of deposit and treasury bills. 448 In general, the United Kingdom does not impose restric- tions on transactions between residents of the United King- dom and residents of the Scheduled Territories. Exchange control applies ma in ly to transactions with residents of countries outside the Scheduled Territories. The non-Sched- uled Territories for administrative purposes are divided as follows: (1) the other member countries of the EEC, except the Republic of Ireland; (2) the Overseas Sterling Area (OSA), i.e., the countries other than the Republic of Ireland and Gibraltar which as at June 22, 1972 were treated as Scheduled Territories;4 (3) Rhodesia; and (4) all other countries, usually referred to as the Rest of the Non-Sched- uled Territories (RNST). Administration of Control Exchange control in the United Kingdom is administered by the Bank of England on behalf of the U.K. Treasury. However, practically all commercial banks are authorized to approve most current payments requiring exchange control permission. The licensing of imports and exports is handled by the Department of Trade and Indus t ry. Prescription of Currency Receipts from Scheduled Territories may be in sterling, Irish pounds, or Gibraltar currency; those from other countries, w i th the exception of Rhodesia, must be in sterling from an External Account or in any foreign currency (other than Rhodesian currency), which must be offered for sale to an authorized bank unless permission has been given for the funds to be used for some other purpose. Payments to Sched- uled Territories may be made in sterling, Irish pounds, or Gibraltar currency; payments to other countries, with the exception of Rhodesia, may be made by crediting sterling to an External Account or in any foreign currency except Rho- desian currency. For security reasons, settlements w i th Rhodesia are subject to special regulations generally prescribing the use of Rhode- sian Accounts, Suspense Accounts, or, in certain circum- stances, the Rhodesian Special Account w i th the Standard Bank, London. However, unless specifically included among the permitted debits to Rhodesian Accounts, all commercial payments, except those in respect of exports, due from per- sons resident in Rhodesia to residents of the United Kingdom must be received either in a foreign currency (other than Rhodesian currency) or, w i th the specific permission of the 4 The Overseas Sterling Area thus comprises Aus tra l ia, Bahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda, Botswana, British Indian Ocean Territory, Br i t ish Solomon Islands Protectorate, British Virgin Islands, Brunei, Cayman Islands, Cyprus, Falkland Islands and Dependencies, Fiji, The Gambia, Ghana, Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony, Guyana, Hong Kong, Iceland, Ind ia and Sikkim, Jamaica, Jordan, Kenya, Kuwa i t, Leeward Islands, Lesotho, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldive Islands, Malta, Mauritius and Depen- dency, Nau ru, New Zealand, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Pit cairn Islands, Qatar, St. Helena and Dependencies, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, South Africa, South West Africa (Namibia), Sri Lanka, Swaziland, Tanzania, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos Islands, Uganda, United Arab Emirates, Western Samoa, W indwa rd Islands, People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, and Zambia. ©International Monetary Fund.

Persons normally resi- dent in Rhodesia who are living temporarily in the United Kingdom as students or workers may open Temporary Resi- dent Accounts in sterling w i th authorized banks in the United Kingdom; debits to such accounts are generally permitted on ly for living expenses within the United Kingdom. Nonresident Accounts The sterling accounts of residents of other Scheduled Terri- tories are treated in the same way as those of residents of the United Kingdom. Thus, for transfers between Scheduled Ter- ritories no U .K. exchange control permission is required; for payments to other countries by residents of any Scheduled Territory, the authorized banks are required to ensure that the payment has the approval of the exchange control author- ity in the territory concerned. External Accounts. With the exception of Rhodesian Ac- counts and the Rhodesian Special Account (see below), the sterling accounts of nonresidents with banks in the United Kingdom, i.e., those of residents of countries outside the Scheduled Territories, are designated External Accounts. These accounts may be credited with authorized payments by residents of Scheduled Territories, w i th transfers from other External Accounts, with the proceeds from sales of gold or foreign currency other than Rhodesian currency (including banknotes), and with sterling banknotes mailed from outside the Scheduled Territories. External Accounts may be debited, subject to general or special permission, for payments to residents of the Scheduled Territories, for transfers to other External Accounts, for transfers to Rhodesian Accounts other than in payment for certain goods exported from Rho- desia, for payments in cash in the United Kingdom, and for purchases of any foreign currency other than Rhodesian cur- rency (including banknotes) or gold. Rhodesian Accounts. These accounts are applicable to resi- dents of Rhodesia only. Permitted credits include transfers from External Accounts, provided that the bank has no rea- son to believe that the payment is for a purpose prohibited by the Southern Rhodesia (United Nations Sanctions) (No. 2) Order 1968; payments by residents of Scheduled Territo- ries other than the United Kingdom to residents of Rhodesia, subject to the approval of the exchange control authority in the territory concerned; and payments by U.K. residents to residents of Rhodesia in respect of (1) the sale of foreign currencies other than Rhodesian currency, (2) the discount or ma tu r i ty proceeds of U.K. treasury bills, (3) permitted im- ports from Rhodesia which have entered customs in the United Kingdom, (4) insurance and freight charges resulting from permitted trade between Rhodesia and any Scheduled Territory, (5) insurance claims directly related to such permit- ted trade, (6) pensions and widows' annuities where asso- ciated with the deceased husband's employment, (7) charges and fees relating to patents, designs, and trademarks regis- UNITED KINGDOM tered in Rhodesia, Zambia, or Malawi, and (8) ma tur i ty pro- ceeds of certain endowment insurance policies.

Transfers between Rhodesian Accounts and from Rhodesian Accounts to External Accounts are not normally allowed. Suspense Accounts. Unless eligible for credit to Rhodesian Accounts or to the Rhodesian Special Account, payments to persons resident in Rhodesia must be withheld unless the Bank of England directs otherwise; the funds may be placed on Suspense Accounts and, except with specific permission, may only be (1) used to meet U.K. tax payments and safe custody charges due on the monies in question, or (2) placed on deposit with banks or other financial institutions in the name of the U.K. resident by whom they are held. Permission is normally given for residents of Rhodesia to use Suspense Account monies to purchase U.K. sterling securities on a recognized stock exchange in the United Kingdom and to purchase U.K. treasury bills and savings bonds and certifi- cates. Permission is only given for them to purchase Rhode- sian or foreign currency securities, however, when the funds for the purchase are derived from the sale proceeds of other Rhodesian or foreign currency securities, respectively. The Rhodesian Special Account. This is an account oper- ated by the Rhodesia Pensions Office staff in London and maintained with the Standard Bank, London. Pensions and associated payments due to beneficiaries in Rhodesia from residents of the Scheduled Territories and the Overseas Ster- ling Area, and pensions due from Rhodesia to residents of the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, and most parts of the Overseas Sterling Area are normally settled through this account. Corresponding transfers from Rhodesian Accounts in the names of individuals to the Rhodesian Special Account are freely permitted. Permission is not normally given for payments of any other nature to be credited to the Rhodesian Special Account. Subject to specific approval by the Bank of 449 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution UNITED KINGDOM England, any balance on the Special Account may be used to meet the cost of permitted exports to Rhodesia from the Scheduled Territories and the Overseas Sterling Area and of services provided by residents of the Scheduled Territories and the Overseas Sterling Area for account of persons resi- dent in Rhodesia. Imports and Import Payments For import licensing purposes countries outside the United Kingdom other than Rhodesia5 are divided in to eight groups: the Mediterranean Area ,6 the Non-Community A rea ,7 the Non-CEFTA Area, 8 the Dollar Area, 9 Japan, 10 Romania, the Eastern Area, ll and all other countries. Imports from countries other than Rhodesia are admitted under an Open General Import License without restriction, w i th the following exceptions: (1) from all other countries, seven commodities or groups of commodities; 12 (2) from the Dollar Area only, four commodities or groups of commodi- ties; (3) from Japan only, certain textiles; (4) from the Non-CEFTA Area only, one commodity; (5) from the Non-Community Area only, one commodity; (6) from Roma- nia only, two commodities; and (7) from the Eastern Area only, n ine commodities or groups of commodities. Most arti- cles subject to import licensing can be imported in limited quantities under bilateral or global quotas. A few articles may be imported under open individual licenses, i.e., w i thout limit as to quan t i ty or value. Imports of cereals and cereal prod- ucts, beef and veal, mu t ton and lamb, poultry meat, and dairy products other than butter and cheese are subject to mini- mum import prices enforced through autonomously imposed variable import levies. Imports of many other agricultural, horticultural, and livestock products are subject to EEC reg- ulations. Once licensing requirements have been met to import from countries outside the Scheduled Territories other than Rho- desia, whether under Open General Import License or some other form of license, U.K. residents may purchase foreign currency or credit sterling to an External Account to pay for the import, provided that evidence of customs en t ry is sub- mitted or evidence that the goods have been dispatched to the United Kingdom or are to be dispatched immediately on receipt of payment.

The skins of certain rare animals and most primary whale products also cannot be imported under the Open General License from any source. The restrictions on cotton textiles do not apply to countries in Western Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the Un i ted States. 450 ered necessary or in accordance with the traditions of the trade and the continuance of the practice is considered to be essential. Exchange control forms are not required for pay- ments to residents of the Scheduled Territories, neither are they required for payments to residents of other countries, unless the payment represents part or final settlement for goods for which the total amount payable exceeds £5,000, and evidence of importation cannot be presented to the bank before making the remittance. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to residents of other Scheduled Territories may be made freely. Payments to residents of countries outside the Scheduled Territories require exchange control authorization, which (except for payments to resi- dents of Rhodesia)13 is granted freely for all purposes other than sterling usance credits to finance trade directly between principals resident in non-Scheduled Territories outside the Overseas Sterling Area, subject to the presentation of sup- porting evidence. The completion of an exchange control form is required for payments exceeding £1,000 or its equiva- lent. Authorized banks are permitted to approve applications for transfers on account of many categories of current invisi- bles without any limitation, and for other categories up to established limits. Applications for payments in excess of these limits or for purposes for which no delegation of author- ity has been granted are approved by the Bank of England, provided that no unauthorized capital ou tf low is involved. Authorized banks may dispatch sterling banknotes to non- residents except residents of Rhodesia against payment in sterling from an External Account or in any foreign currency other than Rhodesian currency. For any type of travel outside the Scheduled Territories (except to Rhodesia), U.K. residents can obtain on demand from banks and authorized travel agents foreign exchange up to the equivalent of £300 a person a trip; for travel for busi- ness or professional reasons, an allowance of £40 a day up to a maximum of £2,000 for any one journey can be authorized by banks and certain authorized travel agents. Applications for additional amounts are approved by the Bank of England unless there is reason to suspect that the exchange is to be used for purposes other than genuine travel expenditure. The cost of accommodation, fares, etc., can be paid for w i thout limit in the United Kingdom. Travel exchange purchased in the United Kingdom must normally be recorded in the trav- eler's passport. Under arrangements agreed w i th certain banks, personal checks may be cashed abroad for travel pur- poses, up to £30 a check, if backed by check cards. Credit cards may be used freely to settle travel expenses. Resident travelers may take out up to £300 in foreign currency notes. Any unused travel exchange expressed in foreign currency may be retained for a period of one mon th from the date of 13 For security reasons, v i r tua l ly all cu r rent payments to Rhodesia are prohibited, except when these result f rom permitted trade in goods.

Banks have au thor i ty to ap- prove applications by U.K. residents who wish to open for- eign currency accounts outside the Scheduled Territories for the receipt of travel funds for use during their stay abroad. Travel facilities expressed in sterling may be held for six months from the date of issue or for one month from the date of return to the United Kingdom, if later. In addition, resi- dent travelers may take with them up to £25 in U .K. and other Scheduled Territory banknotes, which may be ex- changed or spent abroad only for travel expenditure; but those traveling direct to the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man may take out any amount. Visitors to the United Kingdom are, in addition, allowed to take out any notes that they brought in with them, other than notes in excess of £25 expressed in the currencies of the United Kingdom or the Republic or Ireland. Authorized banks are permitted to approve, w i th in certain limits and subject to the submission of appropriate documen- tary evidence of the amounts due, applications to pay fees, accommodation charges, and all incidental expenses arising from the education of U.K. residents outside the Scheduled Territories. Special regulations apply to all travel to Rhodesia. For approved official and essential business journeys the Bank of England will authorize the issue of foreign currency at a rate of up to £10 a day w i th a maximum of £300. Facilities for private travel are authorized only where there are compas- sionate grounds. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to Rhodesia are subject to licensing control and licenses are normally issued only for the permitted exceptions (medical and educational supplies, foodstuffs where these are special medical preparations, newsfilm and photographs, and documentary and printed matter less than 100 years old) and for equipment for the essential replacement needs of the Rho- desian Railways and the Central African Power Corporation. V ir tua l ly all exports to other destinations are free of export control and no exchange control forms are normally required. Exporters to countries outside the Scheduled Territories other than Rhodesia must normally obtain appropriate pay- ment w i th in six months of shipment; special exchange control permission to collect at a later date is required only where the exporter extends credit for more than six mon ths w i thout cover from the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD). Receipts in foreign currencies must be offered for sale to an authorized bank unless the recipient has obtained specific permission to credit them to a retained currency ac- count (subject to supervision) or permission has been given for them to be used for some other purpose. Permitted ex- ports to Rhodesia must be paid for prior to shipment in any foreign currency other than Rhodesian currency or, if specific permission is granted by the Bank of England, in sterling from the Rhodesian Special Account. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts in foreign currencies on account of invisibles must be offered for sale to an authorized bank, unless recipients of UNITED KINGDOM such currencies have permission to credit them to a retained currency account or to use them for some other purpose. British and other banknotes may be brought into the United Kingdom freely. Capital1* Residents of the United Kingdom who receive foreign cur- rency other than Rhodesian currency from certain capital account sources (mainly the sale or redemption of foreign currency securities and the sale or liquidation of direct invest- ments held outside the Scheduled Territories, Overseas Ster- ling Area, and EEC or of personal residential property situated outside the Scheduled Territories) may, in certain circumstances and w i th permission, use the exchange (which is regarded as investment currency once permission has been given) for the purchase of marketable foreign currency securi- ties, the purchase of personal residential property outside the Scheduled Territories, or the making of approved direct in- vestments (in practice only those outside the Overseas Ster- ling Area); they may also sell the exchange for sterling to other residents to be used for the same purposes. If permis- sion is not forthcoming, the foreign currency must be offered for sale at the rates ruling in the official market to an autho- rized bank in the United Kingdom. If permission is granted, however, the equivalent in foreign currency of 25 per cent of the proceeds must normally be sold to an authorized bank for sterling at the official market rate of exchange. 15»16 This "25 per cent requirement" is not applicable, however, to the pro- ceeds from the sale or redemption of foreign currency securi- ties payable solely in an Overseas Sterling Area currency or payable in such a currency and sterling (but see footnote 14). In certain circumstances, residents of the United Kingdom who are foreign nationals and who have obtained exemption from their liabilities under the Exchange Control Act in re- 14 W i th effect from March 27, 1974 a number of changes in exchange control rules for direct and portfolio investment were introduced. Their main effect was the termination of certain preferen t ial t rea tment accorded to the Overseas Sterling Area and the EEC. (1) The rules governing f inance for ou twa rd direct investment in the Overseas S ter l ing Area and the EEC became the same as those already app ly ing to other non-Scheduled Territories. Official exchange henceforth was available on ly for "super-criterion" projects and U .K. compa- nies were normally expected to finance new investments in the Overseas Sterling Area and the EEC by borrowing foreign currency or by one of the other permitted methods not involving the use of official exchange. (2) U .K. companies henceforth were expected normally to arrange for the repatriation to the United Kingdom of not less than two th irds of the net taxed earnings of their OSA subsidiaries, a requirement already observed w i th regard to subsidiaries in other non-Scheduled Territories ( inc lud ing the EEC). (3) The proceeds of sales and l iqu ida t ions of direct investments in non-Scheduled Territories outside both the EEC and the Overseas Sterling Area ceased to be eligible for sale in the inves tment currency market and had to be offered for sale for s ter l ing at the current market rate of exchange, as previously applicable to realization proceeds in EEC and Overseas Sterling Area countries. (4) Proceeds accruing to U .K. residents from the redemption or sale proceeds of securities payable or optionally payable in Overseas Sterling Area currencies became subject to the same 25 per cent surrender rules applicable to such proceeds of securities payable or optionally payable in non-Sterling Area currencies. 15 Where currency is received from similar sources by residents of other Scheduled Territories, permission may also be given for such funds to be regarded as investment currency; in this case, the 25 per cent requirement would norma l ly app ly, but for securities owned prior to April 7, 1965, or any o ther foreign currency securities derived therefrom by way of "switches," the requirement applies on ly on ou t r ight sales for s ter l ing or for reinvestment in s ter l ing securities. 18 The fu ll amount of the currency proceeds is normally permitted to be sold as inves tment currency when a residential property has been held for private use; when it has been held as an inves tmen t, however, the proceeds are not normally eligible to be treated as investment currency. 451 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution UNITED KINGDOM spect of assets denominated in the currency of the country of their nationality may obtain permission for the sale proceeds of exempted securities to be sold for sterling in the investment currency market up to 75 per cent of the amount concerned. In rare circumstances, exempted cash balances may also be sold as investment currency. There are no restrictions on capital transfers by residents of the United Kingdom into the beneficial ownership of resi- dents of other Scheduled Territories. All capital transfers by residents to countries outside the Scheduled Territories require approval. Each individual resi- dent of the United Kingdom may, from his own resources, make cash gifts or personal loans not exceeding a total of £1,000, or the equivalent in foreign currency, during each calendar year to residents of the Overseas Sterling Area, as well as a fu r ther £300 or the equivalent to residents of other countries outside the Scheduled Territories except Rhodesia; additional amounts may be allowed under appropriate cir- cumstances. The cash gifts allowance is noncumulative and is not transferable from one resident to another. A resident of the United Kingdom w i th dependents who are established residents of countries outside the Scheduled Territories other than Rhodesia may make payments from his own resources not exceeding £2,000 a year to support those dependents. Such payments, which may be gifts or loans, are outside the cash g ift scheme and do not prejudice the normal cash gift allowances. For security reasons, no capital transfers are allowed to Rhodesia, whether in the form of direct investment or of the purchase of Rhodesian securities, or by any other means, except to relatives, or other Rhodesian residents where hu- manitarian reasons are given, to the extent of £75 during any period of two years. Direct investments in the Overseas Sterling Area require approval; this is normally granted and for approved projects foreign currency is made available without limitation at offi- cial market rates of exchange. For direct investments in non-Scheduled Territories out- side the Overseas Sterling Area and the EEC, official ex- change is normally made available only for certain projects directly concerned w i th promoting exports of goods and ser- vices where the prospective benefit to the U.K. balance of payments is expected to equal or exceed the total cost of the investment within 18 months and to continue thereafter; this benefit will normally occur by way of additional export re- ceipts, but may also arise from profits and other foreign currency receipts that would not take place without the in- vestment. For such projects ("super-criterion" projects), offi- cial exchange may be made available up to £250,000 or 50 per cent of the total investment, whichever is larger; any balance must be financed by foreign currency borrowing, the use of investment currency, the export free of payment of capital equipment and stock-in-trade forming an integral part of the investment, by the issue or transfer of shares to nonresidents on appropriate terms, by the capitalization of an overseas subsidiary's current account indebtedness to the U.K. parent company, or by approved profit retention. Direct investment other than for super-criterion projects is considered on the basis that its capital cost should not fall 452 directly upon the U.K. official foreign exchange reserves at least un t il an equivalent amount has been received in the United Kingdom by way of benefits arising from the invest- ments; such investments can normally be financed by foreign currency borrowing, the use of investment currency, the ex- port free of payment of capital equipment and stock-in-trade forming an integral part of the investment, by the issue or transfer of shares to nonresidents on appropriate terms, by the capitalization of an overseas subsidiary's current account indebtedness to the U.K. parent company, or by approved profit retention. The permitted proportion of retained foreign currency earnings normally is one third of net earnings after taxes, applied on a global basis where more than one subsid- iary is involved. There is no limit on earnings which may be retained in a subsidiary in the Overseas Sterling Area (but see footnote 14). The same rules apply to direct investment in non-Sched- uled Territories that are member countries of the EEC, with the exception that official exchange up to £1 million a project a year can be used to finance all new approved direct invest- ments in member countries of the EEC (but see footnote 14). The purchase of foreign currency securities outside the Scheduled Territories must be financed either with invest- ment currency or with foreign currency borrowing. Such bor- rowing is freely permitted when undertaken by or through U.K. professional security managers, and the resale of foreign currency securities acquired in this manner is exempt from the "25 per cent requirement" until the loan portfolio is liqui- dated and the profit repatriated. Purchases of marketable foreign currency securities with investment currency are freely permitted by virtue of certain general permissions granted to banks, stockbrokers, and other authorized deposi- tories. Purchases from other residents may also be effected with sterling on The Stock Exchange (sterling prices reflect the prevailing investment currency premium). The purchase by U.K. residents of a house or apartment for personal use in countries outside the Scheduled Territories requires specific approval and must be made either from an- other Scheduled Territory resident for sterling or another Scheduled Territory currency or from a nonresident of the Scheduled Territories with investment currency; payment for attendant expenses and improvements, but not maintenance, must also be made with investment currency. (As an excep- tion to this rule, residents temporarily employed in the Over- seas Sterling Area or member countries of the EEC may be authorized to purchase necessary accommodation at current official market rates of exchange.) Approval is normally lim- ited to one property a family; purchases of investment cur- rency are normally limited to reasonable amounts and may be made before exchange control approval is received pro- vided that the funds are held by an authorized depository and that a formal application is lodged to purchase the property within six months. All proceeds from the realization, redemption, or maturity of sterling capital assets (including direct investments) owned by nonresidents of the Scheduled Territories other than resi- dents of Rhodesia are remittable at the official rate of ex- change. Payments to nonresident beneficiaries are authorized freely in respect of inheritances due from the estates of de- ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ceased residents; capital payments under life and other insur- ance policies taken up by nonresidents w i th resident insur- ance companies are also authorized freely. Residents of the United Kingdom who leave with the in- tention of residing for at least three years in a country outside the Scheduled Territories and apply to transfer their assets are, on their departure from the United Kingdom, regarded for exchange control purposes as nonresidents, and, w i th the following exceptions, their assets are treated accordingly. Re- patriates (non-Scheduled Territory nationals, other than Rhodesians, who having been resident in the United King- dom return to take up residence in their country of national- ity) may normally transfer all their sterling assets abroad at the official rate of exchange. Other residents leaving to take up residence in countries outside the Scheduled Territories and the Overseas Sterling Area except Rhodesia are allowed on departure to transfer for a family unit up to £5,000 through the official foreign exchange market and may export any foreign currency securities they hold; the remaining de- clared assets in excess of £5,000 are restricted for a four-year period from the date of the departing person's redesignation as a nonresident. U.K. residents taking up residence and employment in member countries of the EEC, however, may, with specific approval, transfer sterling assets at the official rate of exchange in excess of the £5,000 limit where this is necessary in order to ensure their freedom to take up the employment in question. For emigration to the Overseas Sterling Area, the basic settling-in allowance is £20,000 (with a similar concession for those taking up employment), also available at the official rate of exchange, and holdings of foreign currency securities are exportable. During the four-year period the restricted funds may be disposed of for foreign currencies other than Rhodesian currency through the investment currency market, or may be invested in sterling securities which are quoted on The Stock Exchange, the income therefrom being freely re- mittable through the official exchange market. After the four-year period any remaining assets are transferable in ac- cordance with the rules then applicable to the assets of a nonresident; at present, the transfer at the official rate of exchange is normally allowed. The participation of foreign capital as a direct investment in the United Kingdom is subject to individual authorization, which is normally granted, provided that adequate capital for the project is supplied in an approved manner of payment (see section on Prescription of Currency, above) or by the import of goods and services; the foreign currency received must be surrendered at rates ruling in the official market unless per- mission has been given for the funds to be used for some other purpose. Cases involving the take-over of existing companies that by their size or nature constitute a vital part of British industry are considered on their merits. Permissions given for direct investments in the United Kingdom by nonresidents normally are, unless otherwise agreed with the Bank of Eng- land, conditional on the consideration being paid in sterling from an External Account or in foreign currency (other than Rhodesian currency) and, where nonresidents (other than residents of the EEC and the Overseas Sterling Area) have a controlling interest, on any subsequent finance being pro- UNITED KINGDOM vided in foreign currency at least in proportion to the nonresi- dent interest in the equity of the company. Foreign firms and foreign individuals must obtain permis- sion from the Treasury in order to raise capital in the United Kingdom, and U.K. resident subsidiaries of foreign compa- nies are required to obtain consent before issuing shares or other securities to nonresidents. U.K. residents also need permission to lend to U.K. companies controlled by nonresi- dents. Such permission is normally given for sterling lending for the purpose of financing the company's day-to-day busi- ness, but is not normally given for any expansion of manufac- turing capacity except for companies whose activities are regarded as bringing special advantages to the U.K. econ- omy. There are three important exceptions to these principles: (1) Unlimited sterling finance in the United Kingdom is nor- mally allowed to U.K. companies in which any nonresidents have less than a controlling interest, except to companies which are purely vehicles for portfolio investment. (2) U.K. companies controlled by residents of the EEC or the Overseas Sterling Area that are not purely vehicles for portfolio invest- ment are normally allowed unlimited sterling finance for their operations anywhere in the United Kingdom. (3) U.K. com- panies controlled by residents of any non-EEC country out- side both the Scheduled Territories and the Overseas Sterling Area are upon application allowed similar facilities in respect of new expenditure in the areas of the United Kingdom which qualify for special government assistance (the assisted areas), while their requests in respect of new expenditure in other areas of the United Kingdom are considered on their merits. U.K. banks are prohibited from providing sterling loans or overdrafts to persons resident outside the Scheduled Territo- ries and the Overseas Sterling Area for the purpose of financ- ing trade between non-Scheduled Territories, but sterling lending to residents of the Overseas Sterling Area to finance trade with such non-Scheduled Territories is unrestricted. Borrowing by U.K. residents from nonresidents of the Scheduled Territories to finance expenditure in the United Kingdom is subject to restriction. Private sector U.K. resi- dents other than authorized banks normally are not permit- ted to borrow foreign currency from nonresidents of the Scheduled Territories for conversion into sterling for use in the United Kingdom, or to finance current payments to non- residents of the Scheduled Territories, unless the term of the borrowing is at least two years (five years in the case of borrowing for personal consumption, property development, or financial transactions); exporters, merchants, and certain commodity traders are, however, permitted to borrow foreign currency for shorter periods from authorized banks to finance their sales. Public sector bodies normally are not permitted to borrow foreign currency unless the term of the foreign borrowing is at least five years. Authorized banks must not lend foreign currency to U.K. residents other than authorized banks for any other purpose without prior reference to the Bank of England. Under certain permissions delegated to authorized deposi- tories, transactions in securities of most types may generally be carried out freely between residents of the United King- dom, except that transactions in Rhodesian securities may only be effected on The Stock Exchange. Residents are nor- 453 ©International Monetary Fund.

When foreign cur- rency securities expressed in currencies other than Overseas Sterling Area currencies are sold on The Stock Exchange for sterling, an amount of investment currency in the form of foreign currency (other than Rhodesian currency) equivalent to 25 per cent of the sale proceeds must be purchased in the investment currency market for resale to an authorized bank at the official market rate of exchange. Professional dealers mak ing a "book" may on application be exempt from the 25 per cent requirement in respect of transactions on the "book." Investment currency held for a continuous period of 6 mon ths ceases to be investment cur- rency unless an amount of investment currency in the form of foreign currency (other than Rhodesian currency) equiva- lent to 25 per cent of the amount held is, at the end of the 6-month period, sold to an authorized bank at the current market rate in the official foreign exchange market, except for certain authorities for the purchase of private property out- side the Scheduled Territories where investment currency may be retained for up to 18 mon ths w i thout the 25 per cent requirement being imposed. Investment currency may on ly be retained as investment currency for a max imum of 12 months, after which period any amount remaining must be offered for sale to an authorized bank at the current market rate in the official foreign exchange market. 17 Professional security managers acting on their own behalf and for clients are permitted, subject to certain conditions, to borrow foreign currency for the purpose of mak ing portfolio investments in marketable foreign currency securities. U.K. jobbers and other security dealers may, with permission, ar- range day-to-day borrowing of foreign currency, whether from U.K. banks or from nonresidents, to finance a "book" in foreign currency securities, but not to finance holdings of such securities as investments. Residents of other Scheduled Territories are not prevented by the U.K. regulations from buy ing and selling sterling secu- rities in the United Kingdom; they may also buy and sell, subject to certain conditions, Rhodesian securities on The Stock Exchange, but they must obtain the permission of the U.K. authorities to buy and sell other securities in the United Kingdom. Permission is required for all transfers of securities in the United Kingdom in which a nonresident of the Scheduled Territories is involved as either transferor or transferee, but most transfers are covered by a general au thor i ty. In most cases, U.K. companies may issue sterling securities (including 17 Inves tment currency may be invested temporarily in short-term govern- ment bonds (with up to six mon ths to run before f inal m a t u r i t y) or in s ix -mon th treasury bills or other forms of recognized short-term money-market paper ( inc lud ing certificates of deposit) w i thout incu r r ing the need to comply w i th the 25 per cent requirement on resale of the paper. 454 bearer securities) under a general permission given by the U.K. authorities. Nonresidents of the Scheduled Territories except Rhode- sian residents may buy sterling securities on The Stock Ex- change against payment in foreign currency or in sterling from an External Account. Securities so purchased may be exported from the United Kingdom. Foreign currency securi- ties may be bought and sold by nonresidents of the Scheduled Territories on The Stock Exchange for settlement in foreign currency or, in certain circumstances, for settlement in ster- ling w i thout the benefit of the investment currency premium. Nonresidents must obtain permission to buy securities in the United Kingdom other than on The Stock Exchange, whether or not the securities are quoted on a stock exchange. Nonresi- dents other than Rhodesian residents may sell sterling securi- ties in the United Kingdom for sterling which may be held on External Account or, alternatively, the proceeds may be transferred abroad at official market rates. All transactions in securities by or on behalf of residents of Rhodesia require the specific approval of the Bank of England. Except in respect of U.K. companies controlled by nonresi- dents of the Scheduled Territories (where Bank of England consent is required), warran ts issued by registrars, company secretaries, and paying agents in respect of capital payments on matured securities registered in the names of nonresidents other than Rhodesian residents may be dispatched freely to addresses outside the Scheduled Territories. These warrants may be paid by crediting sterling to an External Account. Authorized banks may freely accept foreign currencies from nonresidents of the Scheduled Territories for deposit; such deposits may be re-lent to other nonresidents or switched in to sterling and made available to domestic bor- rowers who have permission. Ind iv idual ceilings are set on each bank's overall open position in foreign currencies and on the amount of spot assets which may be held against forward liabilities in foreign currencies. The Bank of England has au tho r i ty to call for differential Special Deposits, but this au tho r i ty has not so far been invoked. Gold Residents of the Un i ted Kingdom may freely buy, hold, or sell domestic and foreign gold coins. With this exception, residents of the United Kingdom other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial and professional users are not permitted to purchase, hold, or sell gold in any form other than jewelry, whether at home or abroad, unless they are specifically or generally permitted to do so. Permission is granted restrictively and is generally limited to established genuine domestic requirements for industrial and profes- sional purposes (including the manu fac tu re of gold medals, medallions, etc.). The M int from time to time strikes gold sovereigns. Al- though legal tender, these do not circulate in the United Kingdom. Gold coins which are legal tender have also been issued in Jersey and the Isle of Man.

Not for Redistribution having been current there, has at any time after May 16, 1969 ceased to be so. The import by any resident of the United Kingdom of gold bullion, gold coins, and gold medals, medallions, tablets or other pieces in pictorial relief or bearing inscriptions is on Open General Import License, from all sources except Rho- desia, but the holding of, or dealing w i th, bullion is subject to restrictions, as stated above. The export of gold bullion and all gold coins requires prior exchange control approval. Au- thor i ty has been given to authorized dealers in gold to issue licenses in respect of exports of gold bullion and coin pur- chased by any non-Scheduled Territory resident in the Lon- don gold market against payment in External Account sterling or foreign currency. A license is required from the Department of Trade and Indus try for the export of gold (and other) jewelry, etc., containing diamonds. The export of gold in manufactured form over 100 years old and valued at £4,000 and over also requires a license from the Department of Trade and Industry. Manufactures of gold other than medals, medallions, tab- lets or other pieces in pictorial relief or bearing inscriptions may be imported without quantitative restriction under Open General Import License from all sources except Rhodesia. There is a free gold market in London in which gold bars are freely traded among (1) authorized dealers in gold, (2) any nonresidents of the Scheduled Territories, and (3) residents of the Overseas Sterling Area who are sellers of new production. The U.K. authorities do not intervene in the market as either buyers or sellers. A commission of l/4 of 1 per cent is charged on all purchases; there is no commission on sales. Authorized banks may enter into forward transactions in gold without prior permission from the Bank of England. Banks may also finance purchases of gold by nonresidents of the Scheduled Territories by lending foreign exchange and accept gold as collateral for advances in foreign currencies or External Ac- count sterling to nonresidents of the Scheduled Territories. Changes during 1973 January 1. The United Kingdom became a member of the EEC. The Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement remained in force. January 1. Gibraltar was reinstated as a Scheduled Terri- tory under the Exchange Control Act, 1947. January 1. Additional goods could be imported from the Eastern Area under the Open General Import License. Most had been on open individual license. January 1. Licensing arrangements for cotton yarn and woven cotton textiles from restricted sources were modified. For goods exported on or after this date there would be no global quota, and cotton yarn and woven cotton textiles from all restricted sources would be imported under country quo- tas. Cotton textiles from Israel were placed on Open General Import License. (Certain imports from those Mediterranean countries which had agreements with the EEC would, no later than April 1, 1973, enter the United Kingdom free of quota restrictions.) January 1. An Open General License came into effect which eliminated quantitative restrictions on exports to other UNITED KINGDOM EEC countries of certain nonferrous materials. Another Open General License dealt w i th exports to all destinations except Rhodesia of certain iron and steel scrap; the existing arrange- ments for export controls on iron and steel scrap were ex- tended. January 1. The ECGD offered increased credit insurance cover (up to 40 per cent of the main contract) and widened financial facilities for exporters' subcontracts placed in mem- ber countries of the EEC. January 1. The remaining quan t i ta t ive restrictions on im- ports of industrial goods of EEC origin were removed, as were those on certain agricultural products originating in member countries of the enlarged EEC. (Most remaining restrictions on agricultural products f rom these sources were removed on February 1, 1973.) Quantitative restrictions on imports of certain ju te goods from Austria, Finland, Iceland, Portugal, Sweden, and Switzerland also were removed. January 1. The United Kingdom gave notice of termination w i th effect from February 1, 1973 of the U .K. Bacon Market Sharing Unders tand ing. January 1. The Bank of England's new rules on mergers and participations in the bank ing field came in to operation. January 11. Authorized depositories acting on behalf of residents of the United Kingdom in tend ing to purchase a specific property situated in the non-Scheduled Territories other than Rhodesia for private use were permitted to acquire sufficient investment currency for this purpose before the in tend ing purchaser received exchange control approval, pro- vided that a formal application had been made or would be lodged within six mon ths. The special facilities for the pur- chase of property for private use by U .K. residents who were, or were to be, temporarily employed in Norway, were w i th- drawn. January 25. Re turn ing resident travelers, whatever the pe- riod of absence from the United Kingdom, were permitted to retain any unused travel facilities expressed in foreign cur- rency for a period of one mon th f rom the date of return to the United Kingdom. This brought the rules into line with those applied to the surrender of unused foreign currency obtained abroad by the use of a check guarantee card. Fur- thermore, banks were given delegated au tho r i ty enabling them to approve applications by U.K. residents who wish to open foreign currency accounts in the non-Scheduled Territo- ries other than Rhodesia for the receipt of travel funds for use during their stay abroad. January 26. The Channel Islands were brought within the scope of restrictions on exports of manuscripts, documents, and other archives over 70 years old. January 31. Authorized banks' au tho r i ty to approve cer- tain income payments due to nonresidents under trusts and settlements was extended to include payments of income un- der certain settlements inter vivos created before June 23, 1972. January 31. The trade agreements w i th Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, and South Africa, including the remaining provisions concerning Sterling Area prefer- ences of the Ottawa Agreement of 1932, expired. January 31. Residents of the United Kingdom could upon application make, within their cash gift allowances of £1,000 455 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution UNITED KINGDOM and £300 a year, personal loans as well as outright gifts to nonresidents other than persons resident in Rhodesia. The au thor i ty to banks previously related only to outright gifts. January 31. A resident of the United Kingdom w i th depen- dents who were established residents of countries outside the Scheduled Territories other than Rhodesia could make pay- ments from his own resources not exceeding £2,000 a year to support those dependents. Such payments, which could be gifts or loans, were outside the cash gift scheme and would not prejudice the normal cash gift allowances. Banks were given au tho r i ty to approve such payments. Their au thor i ty previously related only to remittances for the support of de- pendent relatives by persons of non-Scheduled Territory na- t iona l i ty who were, for exchange control purposes, resident in the United Kingdom. February 1. Exports of cast iron scrap were restricted. February 1. Following the adoption by the United King- dom of the EEC Common Agricultural Policy, quan t i ta t ive import restrictions were removed from a number of agricul- tu ral products inc lud ing m i lk, butter, apples, and sugar, irre- spective of origin. February 12. The exchange market was formally closed. It reopened on February 13 and sterling continued to float. February 19. Imports of certain handloom cotton textiles were placed on Open General Import License. March 2. The exchange market was formally closed. It reopened on March 19. March 6. The Treasury reintroduced a fac i l i ty terminated on March 22, 1972 under which it was prepared to provide exchange cover for U.S. dollar borrowing by certain public bodies (nationalized industries and local authorities). The prescribed m in imum ma tur i ty for such borrowing, previously ten years, now was f ive years. Public sector bodies would remain able to borrow in foreign currency w i thout cover subject to obtaining exchange control consent. March 12. The Bank of England announced that agreement had been reached with the banks and the finance houses on a scheme for the application of differential special deposits in respect of domestic and overseas liabilities. (No differential calls for special deposits were made in 1973.) March 19. New exchange rate margin arrangements be- tween certain European currencies came in to operation, based on a decision of the Council of Ministers of the EEC. The United Kingdom did not participate in these arrange- ments and sterling continued to float. March 21. A supplementary quota was established for im- ports of bananas from the Dollar Area. Further increases were announced in June, August, October, and November. March 25. The member exchanges of the Federation of Stock Exchanges in Great Britain and Ireland amalgamated in to a single organization called The Stock Exchange. March 30. Exports of potatoes were restricted. March 31. Cotton textiles from Ireland and Portugal were placed on Open General Import License, provided that the goods were not consigned to the United Kingdom from any source subject to U.K. import restrictions. March 31. For statistical purposes only, specific licenses were required for imports of specified woven polyester-cotton textiles from most sources subject to quan t i ta t ive restrictions 456 for cotton textiles. Licenses were freely issued, except for imports originating in the Eastern Area, Hong Kong, Japan, the Republic of Korea, or the Republic of China. (In July the Department of Trade and Indus t ry advised importers that no guarantee could be given that licenses would continue to be freely available.) April 1. The first of five successive reductions of 20 per cent of import duties on goods originating in EEC member countries took place. (The second reduction occurred on Jan- uary 1, 1974.) Import duties on industrial goods other than those subject to contractual margins of Commonwealth pref- erence were reduced to 80 per cent of the rate applied at January 1, 1972. April 1. The United Kingdom gave effect to its tariff obliga- tions under the Agreements between the European Commu- nities and Austria, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, and Switzerland. In addition, the Community arrangements for trade with Finland and Norway were put into effect until such time as Agreements w i th those two countries come into force. April 1. A value-added tax was introduced. The general rate was 10 per cent. The purchase tax was abolished. April 1. Additional cotton textiles were placed on Open General Import License. May 4. New regulations in respect of gold bullion were issued formally removing certain restrictions imposed when the London gold market reopened on April 1, 1968. They related to (1) authorized dealers in gold entering into forward transactions in gold; (2) authorized banks financing pur- chases of gold by nonresidents by lending foreign currency; and (3) authorized banks accepting gold as collateral against advances of foreign currency to nonresident customers. All of these acts previously required the prior permission of the Bank of England, which had already been freely given for some time. In addition, the directive was revoked which stip- ulated that authorized dealers could make delivery of gold bullion only against payment. May 21. Exports of iron and steel scrap to countries other than EEC member countries were restricted. Since January 1, such exports to all destinations other than Rhodesia had been unrestricted. May 22. The Bank of England announced two measures relaxing the restrictions on sterling lending to nonresidents. It would consider applications by U.K. companies and branches which were not vehicles for portfolio investment and which were controlled by either residents of member countries of the EEC or residents of the Overseas Sterling Area who were themselves controlled directly or indirectly by residents in other countries outside the Scheduled Territories, to raise in the United Kingdom all the finance required for their operations in the United Kingdom. May 25. Certain textiles and textile products originating in the Eastern Area were placed on Open General Import Li- cense. June 4. The Oils, Seeds and Fats Commodity Scheme came into operation; it also covered copra, and the separate facili- ties of the Copra Scheme ceased to be available. The new scheme expanded the Vegetable Oil Scheme arrangements to include dealings, inter alia, in soybean oil, sunflower-seed oil, ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution coconut oil, and marine and animal oils and fats. Participants were allowed to settle between themselves in foreign currency for oils, seeds, and fats originating in non-Scheduled Territo- ries. June 29. Crude petroleum, petroleum products, and natu- ral gas from Eastern Area countries other than Romania were placed under Open General Import License; previously, im- ports from those sources were not permitted. July 1. Restrictions on exports of potatoes and sugar were lifted. July 16. A new Open General Import License came into effect; it did not involve any additional liberalization. July 25. EEC quota restrictions were applied to exports to th ird countries of certain nonferrous scrap materials. August 16. Revised quota levels were announced for im- ports of woven cotton textiles from the Republic of China, Egypt, India, and Pakistan. September 3. A soybean oil futures contract expressed in U.S. dollars was introduced on the London Vegetable Oil Terminal Market. New exchange control rules came in to ef- fect applicable to dealings in such contracts on the London market or on terminal markets abroad. September 6. The Treasury announced that the Govern- ment had undertaken to continue to guarantee certain official sterling reserves of Sterling Area countries for a fur ther six-month period from September 24, the expiration date of the existing guarantee agreements. In broad terms, the guar- antee would be available to holders who maintained in their reserves the minimum sterling proportions set for the pur- poses of their Sterling Agreements or who held amounts obtained by applying those proportions to actual reserve holdings on September 24. An upper limit to the amounts covered by the guarantee was set by reference to the level of holdings on September 24. The guarantee was given at US$2.4213, the average of the exchange rates at noon on the three working days up to and including September 6. The balances eligible for a guarantee payment were official ster- ling reserves held on September 24, 1973 or the last working day of March 1974, whichever were the less, after deduction (as formerly) of an amount equivalent to any official holdings of U.K. equities or 10 per cent of total official external re- serves, whichever was the greater. September 17. A mild arabica coffee futures contract ex- pressed in U.S. dollars was introduced on the London Coffee Terminal Market. New exchange control rules came into ef- fect for dealings in such contracts on the London market or on terminal markets abroad. October 1. Coffee and coffee extract were placed on Open General Import License. October 1. Imports of cocoa beans and cocoa products originating in and consigned from nonmember countries of the International Cocoa Agreement became subject to indi- vidual licensing. October 1. Exports of iron and steel scrap to all destinations were brought under specific license and restricted by quota. October 12. Authorized banks which had approved applica- tions for redesignation from emigrants no longer had to refer to the Bank of England before making available to such emigrants, within their basic emigration allowance, the pro- UNITED KINGDOM ceeds from the sale of declared assets realized after redesigna- tion, provided that any increase in the value of the assets did not take the persons concerned over their basic allowance. October 12. Authorized banks having submitted applica- tions to the Bank of England on behalf of persons who had left the United Kingdom to take up established residence in countries outside the Scheduled Territories, could before their redesignation as nonresidents make available to such persons, without affecting their basic allowance, any income accruing from declared assets, provided that such income accrued to them after the date of their departure from the United King- dom or after the date on which their application for emigra- tion facilities was dispatched to the Bank of England, whichever was the later. October 19. Existing regulations and approval policies were amended to facilitate certain forms of borrowing abroad. (1) The m in imum maturity normally prescribed for foreign cur- rency borrowing for domestic use or to finance current pay- ments to nonresidents was reduced for the private sector from five years to two years; this reduction also applied to the undrawn portions of such loans authorized previously. Appli- cations for borrowing under the two-year rule would be con- sidered by the Bank of England in the light of its guidance to U.K. banks with respect to their lending in sterling; the guidelines in force involved restraint on lending for property development, for private consumption (other than house pur- chase), and for financial transactions. (2) The Treasury's ex- change risk guarantee on foreign currency borrowing by public sector entities, which had previously been limited to dollar loans, was extended to borrowings in other foreign currencies, but the five-year minimum maturity remained in force. (3) The qualification for covered borrowing by local authorities was modified. While the previous guidelines ex- tended only to those authorities which, at a qualifying date in 1972, had gross loan debt of £100 million or more, that qualifying date was now brought forward by one year. October 24. Exports of crude petroleum and petroleum products were placed under export control. Initially, exports were permitted under Open General License, but from No- vember 12 such exports to any destination were controlled by individual licenses. November 1. A large increase in the Cuban cigar quota was announced for 1974. November 9. The permission given to U.K. residents to make payments to residents of the Overseas Sterling Area due under contracts issued or entered into before June 23, 1972 was withdrawn. Any payments still outstanding which could not be completed under existing permissions were to be re- ferred to the Bank of England. November 23. Tariff changes under the second stage in the transition toward the EEC tariff structure were announced, to be effective January 1, 1974. They included the first move toward alignment on the common external tariff. Simulta- neously, tariffs on imports from the developed members of the Commonwealth and on processed foodstuffs from other developed countries would be raised. December 10. Public sector bodies borrowing foreign cur- rency under the Treasury's exchange risk facility were permit- ted to retain a portion of the difference between the applicable 457 ©International Monetary Fund.

The conver t ib i l i ty of the U.S. dollar in to gold and other reserve assets has been suspended and exchange rates are not maintained w i th in any stipulated mar- gin from parity. There are no restrictions on foreign pay- ments, except those imposed for security reasons on transactions invo lv ing the authorities or nationals of Cuba, North Korea, and No r th Viet-Nam, and those imposed pur- suant to UN Security Council Resolutions Nos. 232 and 253 on any transfer of funds to, or on behalf of, or for the benefit of, any person in Rhodesia (including the authorities thereof), unless the funds are in payment of imports of strategic and critical materials of Rhodesian origin. The United States formally notified the Fund on Decem- ber 10, 1946 that it was prepared to accept the obligations of Article V I I I, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Fund Agreement. Administration of Control The Treasury Department deals w i th license applications invo lv ing financial or commercial transactions directly or in- directly w i th Cuba, Nor th Korea, Rhodesia, and Nor th Viet-Nam, or their nationals, as specified under the Foreign Assets Control Regulations, the Cuban Assets Control Regu- lations, and the Rhodesian Sanctions Regulations. It also deals w i th license applications invo lv ing the blocked accounts in the United States of the People's Republic of China under the Foreign Assets Control Regulations. The Foreign Direct Investment Program (FDIP)l is administered by the Office of Foreign Direct Investments (OFDI) in the Department of Commerce. The Federal Reserve Board administers the Vol- un ta ry Foreign Credit Restraint Program for banks and other financial ins t i tu t ions (VFCRP). * The Bureau of Customs of the Treasury Department administers import quotas; such quotas, however, are generally established and allocated by other agencies. Import quotas on specified dairy products are administered by the Department of Agriculture through the issuance of import licenses. The import quotas on sugar are allotted among eligible exporting countries in accordance with a statutory formula administered by the Department of Agriculture and are prorated among eligible importers under regulations administered by that Department. Allocations and licenses for imports of crude petroleum and petroleum products are issued by the Department of the Interior. For items subject to export control other than crude petroleum and petroleum products the Department of Commerce is, in general, the responsible au thor i ty. Imports and Import Payments The importation of merchandise, as well as payment there- for, is prohibited under Treasury regulations, unless licensed, if such merchandise is of Cuban, Nor th Korean, or No r th 1 These programs were terminated w i th effect f rom January 29, 1974.

Import quotas are in effect, pursuant to Section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, for cotton, certain cotton waste, 2 most dairy products, semiprocessed cotton products, wheat and wheat products, and peanuts. Import quotas established by the Sugar Act are in effect for sugar and confectionery. With the exception of the import quotas for peanuts, certain cotton and cotton products, and bu t ter oil, the quotas above, including those for sugar, are on a coun- try-of-production basis. The Un i ted States is a pa r ty to the Long-Term Cotton Textiles Arrangement, which authorizes importing countries to request exporting countries to limit or restrain exports of cotton textiles under specified conditions, and, if the exporting coun try does not accede, to impose an import quota. The United States has concluded comprehen- sive bilateral agreements under the Long-Term Cotton Tex- tiles Arrangement governing imports of cotton textiles, and agreements on man-made and woolen textiles have been reached with the main supplying countries. 3 As at the end of 1973, no limitations were applied to imports of crude petro- leum and petroleum products, but these were generally sub- ject to import licenses and import license fees. Imports of fresh, frozen, or chilled beef, veal, and mu t ton are governed by bilateral agreements as an alternative to manda tory quotas under the Meat Import Act of 1964; in June 1972, however, all meat quotas were suspended. The transfer of funds to Rhodesia for most purposes other than payment for imports of strategic and critical materials (see section on Exchange Rate System, above) is permitted only under license. Other payments and transfers abroad may be made freely, w i th certain exceptions which are permitted only under license; these exceptions are payments to or for the account of the authorities or nationals of Cuba, Nor th Korea, and Nor th Viet-Nam. Exports and Export Proceeds Munitions can be exported only under license issued by the Office of Mun i t ions Control in the Department of State. Li- censes are not granted for exports of arms and ammunition to South Africa. Most exports to Rhodesia require licenses and generally no licenses are issued except for food and hu- manitarian items. All exports (except phonograph records, publications, and, to Cuba, limited gift parcels) to Cuba, Nor th Korea, and North Viet-Nam, are subject to individual validated licenses. 4 Exports of designated strategic materials and equipment to all other countries (except Canada) also require individual validated licenses.

It covers textiles and apparel of cotton, wool, and man-made fibers. 4 On April 18, 1974 the U.S. authorities authorized certain U.S. companies to allow the ir Argen t ine subsidiaries to ship specified locally produced motor vehicles to Cuba. At the t ime it was emphasized that approval of these transactions constituted a special exception to the U.S. embargo on trade w i th Cuba. 459 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution UNITED STATES Japan, single distribution licenses may be obtained to cover a fu ll year's shipments. The licensing requirements applicable to Poland and Romania are less restrictive than those applica- ble to other Eastern European countries (except Yugoslavia). Exports of certain commodities to all destinations have from time to time been subject to control for reasons of short supply; as at the end of 1973 such controls were applicable to ferrous scrap and to crude petroleum and petroleum prod- ucts. The proceeds of exports are not subject to exchange control. Payments for and Proceeds from Invisibles These are not restricted, except that they are prohibited to and from Cuba, Nor th Korea, No r th Viet-Nam, and Rhode- sia. Individuals leaving or entering the coun try w i th more than US$5,000 in domestic or foreign currency, travelers checks, money orders, a n d / or bearer-form negotiable securi- ties must declare these to the customs at the point of exit or en try. Capital* Incoming or outgoing capital payments by residents or nonresidents are not subject to exchange control. However, as noted above, there are restrictions on certain transactions w i th or invo lv ing Cuba, North Korea, North Viet-Nam, and Rhodesia, and there are certain reporting requirements for travelers entering or leaving the coun try (as well as corre- sponding reporting requirements for shipment of currency or bearer assets through the mails). U.S. citizens or residents, when purchasing foreign stocks and debt obligations (including shares in offshore mu tual funds) from foreigners, are subject to an Interest Equalization Tax (IET) equivalent to a borrowing charge of % of 1 per cent a y e a r6 (the rate of tax being 11.25 per cent for certain acquisitions of stock and 0.79 per cent to 11.25 per cent, depending on ma tu r i ty, for certain acquisitions of debt obli- gations, including bank loans, w i th a period remaining to ma tu r i ty of one year or more). Major exemptions from the tax are direct investments, investments in less developed coun tr ies ,7 purchases from other U.S. holders, debt obliga- tions acquired in connection w i th exports, and the purchase of original or new issues when the President of the United States determines that the application of the tax will have such consequences for a foreign country as to imperil or threaten to imperil the stability of the international monetary 5 On Janua ry 29, 1974 it was announced that w i th immediate effect the rate of Interest Equalization Tax (IET) was reduced to zero and the VFCRP and FDIP were terminated. This action included rescission of the controls on repayment of ou t s tand ing foreign borrowings announced by OFDI on December 26, 1973. 8 Reduced to the equivalent of V4 of 1 per cent for trades and acquisitions of foreign stocks or obligations made a f ter December 31, 1973, un t il reduced to zero on January 29, 1974. 7 Among other countries the tax is applicable to Abu Dhabi, Bahamas, Bahrain, Bermuda, I ran, I raq, Kuwait-Saudi Arabia Neutral Zone, Libyan A rab Republic, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia.

The VFCRP has resulted in the establishment of "guide- lines" for U.S. banks, U.S. agencies and branches of foreign banks, and U.S. nonbank financial institutions in respect of their foreign assets. Federal Reserve member banks must meet marginal re- serve requirements of 8 per cent on large-denomination time deposits (US$100,000 and above) and related instruments, including Euro-dollars; certain large nonmember banks and agencies and branches of foreign banks comply voluntarily, at the request of the Federal Reserve Board. The mandatory FDIP has placed restraints on direct in- vestment by setting annual limits on net capital outflow plus reinvested earnings, and limiting the amount of certain types of short-term financial assets held abroad by direct inves- tors.8 A direct investor is defined as a person within the United States who directly or indirectly controls, owns, or acquires 10 per cent or more of the voting power or right to receive income of a foreign national. Three regional ceilings are enforced on the making of direct investment during any year by direct investors which do not elect the minimum world-wide allowable; 9 one for less developed countries;10 one for other countries judged to be dependent on a substan- tial continuing inf low of capital that cannot be adequately met from non-U.S. sources;11 and one for all other coun- tries. 12 However, direct investors are virtually free to finance new or additional direct investments with long-term funds and rolled-over short-term funds borrowed in any foreign country except Canada. Canada is exempt from all balance of payments restraints, except for the application of the IET to some transactions. Gold Residents may import, purchase, hold, and sell for numis- matic purposes domestic and foreign gold coins minted be- fore 1960. Gold coins minted after 1959 may be held if they have been determined to be of recognized special value to collectors. Licenses are required to import any gold coins minted after 1959, and these are not normally issued. The import of counterfeit coins and restrikes is prohibited. Gold bullion may not be held in the United States except by monetary authorities and licensed industrial, professional, and artistic users. The purchase or holding of gold abroad by U.S. citizens and firms is also prohibited except under license 8 Where the regulations require a company to repatriate more income than is allowed by host coun try laws or by business circumstance, such as joint ownership situations, specific relief may be granted by the OFDI. 9 A single m in imum allowable of US$6 million world-wide was permitted un t il November 27, 1973, when it was increased to US$10 million. 10 As defined for the purposes of the IET (see footnote 7).

Licensing author- ity is vested in the Secretary of the Treasury. Producers of gold may sell their output at free market prices either to licensed industrial users or abroad (except to monetary au- thorities). Gold may be freely imported by licensed users within the limitations of their authorized inventory holding. A license is required for the export of gold except gold recov- ered from natural deposits in the United States which may be exported without license. Commercial imports of gold jewelry are free of quantitative restriction. Imports and exports of gold coins and gold bul- lion are free of customs du ty and other fiscal charges. Domes- tic sales of jewelry, including gold jewelry, are subject to excise du ty at the rate of 15 per cent, while domestic sales of gold in any other form, including rare gold coins, are free of fiscal charges. The use of the international reserve assets of the United States has been limited to settlement of outstanding obliga- tions and, in cooperation with the International Monetary Fund, to other situations that might arise in which such use could contribute to international monetary stability and the interests of the United States. Changes during 1973 January 1. The suspension of quota restrictions on meat imports was extended to the end of 1973. January 1. All import limits on No. 2 heating oil were removed for the period to April 30, 1973. The quota for imports of crude and unfinished oil and finished products for the Eastern United States was increased to 2.7 million barrels a day for 1973. January 2. The following changes in the FDIP were an- nounced: (1) credits extended by direct investors to their affiliated foreign nationals with respect to the export sale or lease of qualifying U.S. goods and services on normal com- mercial terms would be exempted under the FDIP regula- tions; (2) the alternative minimum positive direct investment allowables would be consolidated into a single world-wide minimum allowable of US$6 million a year; and (3) as in the 1971 and 1972 program years, direct investors would be al- lowed to count certain transactions effected in the first two months of 1974 for purposes of computing their 1973 pro- gram compliance in respect of the repatriation of foreign claims. (Since in accordance with (1) the extension of qualify- ing export credits would be exempt from charge under the FDIP after December 31, 1972, repayments of such credits to the direct investor after that date would not be counted as negative transfers of capital for 1973 or subsequent compli- ance years.) The exemption of qualifying export credits would eliminate any substantial distinction between the FDIP and the other U.S. capital controls in the treatment of extension of export financing. January 8. Amendments published on December 9, 1972 to the Antidumping Regulations came into effect. On the same date, the Treasury imposed a countervailing duty on imports from a manufacturer enjoying subsidies in his home country. UNITED STATES January 10-11. Direct export subsidies for lard, broilers, and wheat flour were terminated. As a result, direct subsidies on the export of farm products were being paid only on peanuts, the domestic production of which also received sub- sidies. February 12. The United States informed the International Monetary Fund that the President was requesting that the Congress authorize a proposal to the Fund that there be a 10 per cent reduction in the par value of the dollar from SDR 0.921053 to SDR 0.828948 (equivalent to US$42.222222 a f ine ounce of gold). The anticipated change in the par value of the dollar was reflected in international markets at once (see also October 18, below). February 12. It was announced that the IET and the FDIP would be terminated at the latest by December 31, 1974 and that the Federal Reserve Board would consider comparable steps for the VFCRP. This intention was reaffirmed on March 16, 1973 when the U.S. authorities emphasized that the phasing out of the controls on long-term capital outflows by the end of 1974 was intended to coincide with a strong improvement in the U.S. balance of payments position and that any steps taken during the interim period toward their elimination would take due account of exchange market con- ditions and balance of payments trends. February 12. It was announced that the President would send shortly to the Congress proposals for comprehensive trade legislation. March 15. The import price break level for cheese under quota was raised from 47 cents a pound f.o.b. to 69 cents a pound f.o.b. The President asked the Tariff Commission to investigate the need for a temporary increase in cheese import quotas and to report its findings by April 7. March 25. The President issued a proclamation permitting the Oil Policy Committee to grant oil company requests for import licenses without regard to the quota of 250,000 barrels a day. April 10. The President signed into law a 15-month exten- sion of the IET, up to June 30,1974. Although technically the tax had expired on April 1, most brokers agreed to continue collecting it in anticipation of congressional action. The ex- tension was retroactive to April 1. The IET was amended as follows: (1) securities newly is- sued by foreigners to finance foreign direct investment in the United States were exempted, provided that the foreign in- vestment was for a minimum period of ten years and that at least 50 per cent of the total cost was financed from abroad; (2) certain securities sold to foreigners which were subject to IET when sold to U.S. residents were exempted from U.S. estate taxes; and (3) the exemption for less developed countries was limited to corporations that have significant operations within such countries, thereby excluding shipping companies registered in developing countries but owned by nonresidents and obtaining a substantial portion of their in- come from operations outside such countries. April 10. The President transmitted to Congress the Trade Reform Act of 1973 as well as a companion bill amending the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Webb-Pomerene Act. Proposals for a system of generalized tariff preferences in favor of developing countries were included. 461 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution UNITED STATES April 23. A Treasury decision was published regarding the extent to which price information relating to sales below cost of production should be used in determining "fair value" w i th in the meaning of the An t idump ing Act of 1921, as amended. The conclusion was based on the s ta tu tory defini- tion of "foreign market value" in the Act. April 25. A Presidential Proclamation increased with im- mediate effect the annual cheese quota for each supplying coun t ry by 50 per cent; the additional quantities had to be entered prior to August 1. An Executive Order to this effect was issued on May 17. May 1. Quantitative controls on imports of crude petro- leum and petroleum products were terminated, import duties were suspended, and a system of import license fees was introduced; the fees would be increased progressively over a period of seven years. Imports of ethane, propane, butanes, and asphalt were free of both license and fee. May 11. The 1973 import quota for non fat dry milk was increased from 26.8 million to 86.8 million pounds. May 16. It was announced that Federal Reserve System Regulations D, M, and Q were being amended as follows: (1) The reserve requirements on member banks' Euro-dollar bor- rowings and foreign branch loans to U.S. residents were w i th immediate effect reduced from 20 per cent to 8 per cent. 13 (2) The reserve-free bases were being phased out over a period of approximately eight months. (3) The limitations on the rates of interest which member banks may pay on a single ma tu r i ty deposit of US$100,000 or more were suspended, regardless of ma tur i ty (previously, the ceilings were suspended only for maturities of 30-89 days; interest payments on deposits w i th a m a tu r i ty of less than 30 days, other than official fund s, remained prohibited). The purpose was to align the treatment of Euro-dollar borrowings w i th that accorded large certifi- cates of deposit and other bank-related commercial paper, which were not subject to an 8 per cent marginal reserve requirement. May 16. The Federal Reserve Board asked key nonmember banks for their cooperation in conforming to the new regula- tions issued the same day. Specifically, such banks were re- quested to hold reserve deposits against increases in large certificates of deposit. May 24. The OFDI announced substantially improved benefits for direct investors selling their equ i ty securities abroad for cash or exchanging them for the stock or assets of a foreign company held by a large number of foreign nation- als. Previously, only the proceeds of long-term foreign bor- rowing (mainly issues of bonds and convertible bonds, but not issues of shares) and under certain circumstances ex- changes of equity shares could be used as an offset to positive direct investment. Under the new specific authorization pol- icy, a direct investor could be specifically authorized to make positive direct investment in addition to its "Subpart E" al- lowables, in recognition of an equity transaction in which foreign nationals (other than Canadians) obtained the direct investor's securities for investment. For those of its shares 13 There was an exemption from the reserve requirement where a corporate headquarters in the United States borrowed Euro-dollars for use outside the Un i ted States in order to comply w i th OFDI regulations. The Federal Reserve Board term ina ted t h is exemption on February 11, 1974. 462 sold that qualified for this relief, the direct investor would normally be granted a specific authorization in an amount up to 90 per cent of the net proceeds of the sale, and for those of its shares exchanged that qualified, the direct investor would normally be granted a specific authorization in an amount up to 90 per cent of the value of the shares based on their market value on the date they were transferred to the foreign nationals. There was also a relaxation of various rules covering the exchange by a direct investor of its equity shares for the stock or assets of a foreign en t i ty held by a small number of foreign nationals; among other things, for such an exchange transac- tion that qualified for relief, the direct investor would nor- mally be granted a specific authorization for an amount equal to 100 per cent of the value of its shares exchanged, but the direct investor would be charged w i th a transfer of capital in any year in which the original foreign recipients disposed of any of the shares. Previously, the overseas issuance of equity securities had been permitted as an offset only on a limited basis, because of the d i f f i cu l ty of monitoring the resale of any such securities to U.S. residents. The new rules came into force on June 25, 1973 but they were retroactive to January 1, 1973. May 29. An extensive review of U.S. unilateral export con- trols (i.e., non-COCOM controls published by the U.S. De- par tment of Commerce as the Commodity Control List) was completed. This review was undertaken pursuant to Section 4(b) of the Export Adm in is tra t ion Act of 1969, as amended. As a result of the review, the number of commodity categories subject to U.S. unilateral controls was reduced from 550 to 73. June 1. The Federal Reserve Board requested U.S. agen- cies, branches, and nonmember bank subsidiaries of foreign banks vo lun tar i ly to observe the new reserve requirement of May 16, 1973 (providing for an 8 per cent marginal reserve) on any increase in borrowings from banks abroad, including their own head offices. It was proposed that for agencies, branches, investment companies aff i l ia ted w i th foreign banks, and U.S. subsidiaries of foreign banks the 8 per cent reserve be maintained against any additional increases in net funds obtained f rom foreign banks over the amounts obtained on average during the mon th of May. The amounts to be in- cluded would consist of net balances due to directly related ins t i tu t ions abroad, together with net time deposits of, and net borrowings from, other foreign banks. June 4. The Secretary of the Treasury informed the Con- gress that the Administration would have no objection if Congress wished to legislate removal of the 30 per cent w i th- holding tax on dividends paid to foreigners, thus removing a disincentive for foreign investors to purchase U.S. equity shares. June 19. The President removed all federal fees from 1973 imports of petroleum products from Canada; the import li- cense fees imposed on May 1 were removed, and a more lenient schedule of fees would come in to effect on May 1, 1974. June 25. An amendment to the Foreign Direct Inves tment Regulations was published which provided that an acquisi- ©International Monetary Fund.

June 27. An embargo was imposed on the export of soy- beans and cottonseeds and various meal and oil products of soybeans and cottonseeds. The embargo was replaced on Ju ly 2 by a system of validated licenses and partial fu l f i l lm ent of contracts ou ts tand ing on June 13. On Ju ly 5, additional products were placed under validated export licensing re- quirements; they included fish meal, peanuts, edible fa ts such as lard and tallow, and almost all edible oils. July 2. Exports of iron and steel scrap became subject to licensing. July 10. It was announced that the amount of the reciprocal currency arrangements ("the swap network") between the Federal Reserve System and 14 foreign central banks and the BIS had been increased from US$11.7 billion to nearly US$18 billion. On the same date, the System began certain in terven- tion operations in the exchange ma rke t. On Ju ly 18 a jo int statement was issued by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the Secretary of the Treasury that in terven t ion would take place "at whatever times and in whatever amounts are appropriate for ma in ta in ing orderly market conditions." July 17. The OFDI announced that although compliance with the FDIP was measured on the basis of the calendar year, a direct investor might deduct from positive direct in- vestment made dur ing 1973 an amount equal to any available proceeds of long-term foreign borrowing or of borrowing from the direct investor's overseas finance subsidiary made on or before February 28, 1974, that were "allocated" to such positive direct investment on or before that date (provided that the proceeds, as of February 28, 1974, were not held, directly or indirectly, in any form of foreign property). This decision was in line with the practice which started late in 1971 of allowing direct investors two additional mon ths for compliance on a calendar year basis. July 19. The Federal Reserve Board amended the VFCRP to request U.S. agencies and branches of foreign banks to observe specific lending ceilings under the VFCRP, stating that the lack of a specific guideline had produced some un- evenness in observance of the VFCRP. The ceiling of a U.S. agency or branch of a foreign bank that held US$ 1 million in foreign assets would be equal to its holdings of foreign assets on June 30, 1973 of types subject to restraint under the guidelines less any decrease (or plus any increase) in its liabili- ties to foreigners subsequent to June 30, 1973. Subsequent to that date any increase in such assets should be at least matched by an increase in foreign liabilities; correspondingly, any increase in such liabilities should be accompanied by at least an equal reduction in such assets. The guidelines, as amended, thus permitted the ins t i tu t ions concerned to in- crease their claims on non-U.S. residents to the extent that they increased the amount of funds they borrowed from their own parent banks and from other non-U.S. sources; this did not change the degree of restraint affec t ing these ins t i tu t ions. Previously, the guidelines had asked merely that the ins t i tu- UNITED STATES tions concerned act in conformity w i th the spirit of the VFCRP guidelines and to consult w i th the Federal Reserve Bank in the ir district; since December 1, 1971 they had also been asked to submit mon th ly reports on their foreign asset positions.

September 21. The Congress adopted an Act to Amend the Par Value Modification Act (U.S. Public Law 93-110); Sec- tion 3 of the new Act repealed Sections 3 and 4 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 and l if ted all restrictions proh ib i t ing U.S. citizens and residents from purchas ing, holding, selling, or otherwise dealing in gold. These provisions would come in to effect on ly when the President found and reported to Congress th at in te rna t ional mone tary reform had proceeded to the point where elimination of regulations on private own- ership of gold would not adversely affect the United States' in terna t ional monetary position. September 21. The Secretary of the Treasury was autho- rized and directed by Title II of the Act amending the Par Value Modification Act to require submission of reports on foreign currency transactions conducted by any U.S. person and by any foreign person controlled by a U.S. person, as such terms are defined in Section 7 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Congressional statement of f ind ings in- cluded in Title II made it clear that the Congress found it desirable to supplement existing legal au tho r i ty for the collec- tion of data on capital flows, including transactions by large U.S. business enterprises and their foreign affiliates. The Treasury announced that it would soon issue regulations to implement the reporting requirement. October 18.

The OFDI announced a new category of relief by specific authorization in the matter of affiliated foreign national earnings stemming from certain translation gains arising through foreign currency revaluations (including those on inventories). The OFDI also stated that acts in- tended to avoid the long-term foreign borrowing require- ments imposed by the regulations by means of short-term negative capital transfers from AFNs at year-end ("round tripping") m ight be viewed as cons t i tu t ing an evasion of the spirit and in ten t ion of the regulations, which envisaged com- pliance by mak ing a long-term foreign borrowing, the pro- ceeds of which must remain outstanding for a period of 12 con t inuous months. November 5. The U.S. Tariff Commission announced new customs valuation reporting requirements, to come in to effect on December 10. November 27. Quota restrictions on sugar imports were suspended un t il the end of 1974. November 27. The OFDI announced that its regulations were being amended to ease year-end compliance problems. First, the "earnings allowable" would be revised to authorize 60 per cent of the greater of 1972 or 1973 AFN earnings; the existing allowable of 40 per cent was calculated exclusively on the basis of the previous year's earnings. Second, there would be a relaxation in the controls covering the m in imum allow- able inves tment that smaller direct investors w i th no substan- tial historical base could make w i thout hav ing to transfer funds back to the United States, either by repatriation of excess earnings or by borrowing funds abroad. The amount allowable (world-wide) under this criterion would be raised from US$6 million to US$10 million. December 13. Exports of crude petroleum and petroleum products were made subject to licensing. December 17. The Treasury eased the restrictions on im- ports of gold coins by issuing a general import license cover- ing all foreign gold coins minted f rom 1934 through 1959; the import of such coins minted prior to 1934 had long been unrestricted. However, it was announced that licenses would no longer be issued for the import of gold coins m in ted af ter 1959. December 26. It was announced that the United States was mak ing new ad jus tmen ts in the various programs that re- strained capital outflows: (1) The IET would be reduced from the existing rate of approximately 0.75 per cent to the equivalent of 0.25 per cent; the new rate schedule would be applicable to trades and acquisitions of foreign stocks or obligations made after De- cember 31, 1973. 464 (2) The following liberalization in the FDIP would be effec- tive for 1974: (a) The m in imum world-wide allowable avail- able to smaller direct investors would be raised from US$10 m i l l ion to US$20 m i l l ion, (b) The earnings allowable would be increased from 60 per cent to 100 per cent of foreign a f f i l ia te earnings for either 1973 or 1974, at the direct inves- tor's election. This would permit compliance with the regula- tions w i thout the necessity of foreign earnings remittance, (c) A new "debt repayment allowable" would be added to the regulations, which would authorize a direct investor to repay 20 per cent of its total outstanding foreign borrowing allo- cated to positive direct investment as of the end of the 1973 compliance year. This repayment allowable would be in addi- tion to the m in imum, historical, and earnings allowables. The m in imum, historical, and earnings allowables would not, however, be available for debt repayment and direct investors would not be permitted to reduce outstanding foreign debt below 80 per cent of the amount allocated effective as of year-end 1973. The regulations would operate to permit re- payment of specific outstanding debt obligations, but direct investors would be required to refinance aggregate repay- ments in excess of the 20 per cent repayment allowable. Relief for borrowing hardship situations would continue to be avail- able through specific authorization. (3) The fo l low ing amendments to the VFCRP guidelines would be effective January 1, 1974: (a) The ceiling for each commercial bank was increased to US$10 million or to an amount of 4 per cent above the ceiling in effect immediately prior to the present revision, whichever was higher, (b) The request that banks refrain from making nonexpert loans with maturities of over one year to residents of the developed countries of continental Western Europe was eliminated, (c) U.S. agencies and branches of foreign banks would have a ceiling of at least US$10 million for making foreign loans and other investments of types restrained under the Program, whereas the existing m in imum ceiling was US$1 million, (d) Agencies and branches would be able to recalculate the "base net foreign position," which determined the relationship be- tween their foreign lending and foreign borrowing, by using 96 per cent of their foreign liabilities for June 30,1973. (e) The restraint against term loans to the developed countries of continental Western Europe would be dropped for agencies and branches, as it was being dropped for banks, (f) The ceiling of each nonbank financial institution would be in- creased to an amount 5 per cent above that in effect at the end of 1972 or to US$2 million, whichever was higher, (g) The request that nonbank financial ins t i tu t ions refrain from in- creasing their loans and investments in the developed countries of continental Western Europe beyond the amount held at the end of 1968 was eliminated. December 31. The suspension of quota restrictions on meat imports was extended to the end of 1974. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution UPPER VOLTA Exchange System No par value for the currency of Upper Volta has been established w i th the Fund. The un it of currency is the CFA Franc, l which is officially maintained at the rate of CFAF 1 = 0.02 French franc. Exchange transactions in French francs, the intervention currency, between the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de 1'Ouest (BCEAO) and commercial banks take place at the rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02, free of commission. Exchange transactions relating to foreign countries, i.e., countries other than France (and its Overseas Departments and Territories except the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries of the French Franc Area, take place in a dual exchange market at rates based on the fixed rate for the French f ranc and the Paris exchange rate for the foreign currency concerned in either the official exchange market or the financial f ranc mar- ket. Settlements eligible for the official exchange market are payments and receipts in respect of imports, exports, and most other current transactions, as well as all current pay- ments by or in favor of domestic and foreign public authori- ties and public bodies. All other settlements with foreign countries, as well as transactions in banknotes of foreign countries and banknotes issued by the BCEAO, take place through the financial franc market at freely fluctuating rates. The principal current payments and receipts channeled through the financial franc market are those relating to travel expenses, capital earnings, workers' remittances, fam i ly re- mittances, and study abroad. Exchange rates for certain Eu- ropean currencies in the official market are based on par values and central rates; the effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar in this market is not confined w i th in any announced margins. W i th the exception of those relating to gold, Upper Vol- ta's exchange control measures do not apply to (1) France (as defined above) and Monaco; and (2) all other countries whose bank of issue is linked w i th the French Treasury by an Opera- tions Account (Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the People's Republic of the Congo, Dahomey, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). Hence, all payments to these countries may be made freely. All other countries, except Upper Volta itself, are considered foreign countries, and in principle financial relations only w i th for- eign countries are subject to exchange control. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the External Finance Bureau in the Directorate of the Treasury and of Public Ac- counts in the Ministry of Finance and Commerce, which also supervises borrowing abroad, the issuing, advertising, or of- fering for sale of foreign securities in Upper Volta, inward direct investment and all outward investment, and the solicit- ing of funds in Upper Volta for placement in foreign 1 The CFA f ranc is issued by the Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de TOuest (BCEAO) and is the common currency in Dahomey, Ivo ry Coast, Niger, Senegal, Togo, and Upper Vo l ta. countries. The approval au tho r i ty in respect of exchange con- trol, except for imports and exports of gold and business travel allocations in excess of CFAF 400,000 has been dele- gated to the BCEAO and, within limits specified in the ex- change control regulations, to authorized intermediaries. The BCEAO also is authorized to collect, either direct or through the intermediary of banks, financial institutions, the Postal Administration, and notaries public, any information neces- sary to compile the balance of payments statistics. All ex- change transactions relating to foreign countries must be effected through authorized banks, the Postal Administra- tion, or the BCEAO. Import and export licenses are issued by the Directorate of Commerce at the Ministry of Finance and Commerce. Import attestations for liberalized commodi- ties are made out by the importer himself and are visaed by the customs. Prescription of Currency Upper Volta is an Operations Account country of the French Franc Area, since the BCEAO maintains an Opera- tions Account w i th the French Treasury; settlements with France (as defined above), Monaco, and the other Operations Account countries of the French Franc Area are made in CFA francs or French francs. Certain settlements with Ghana are made through special accounts. Settlements with all other countries are usually made through correspondent banks in France in any of the currencies of those countries or in French francs through Foreign or Financial Accounts in Francs. All settlements w i th Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. Nonresident Accounts The regulations pertaining to nonresident accounts are based on those applied in France. BCEAO banknotes may be credited to Financial Accounts in Francs when they have been mailed direct to the BCEAO agency in Ouagadougou by authorized banks' foreign correspondents. Otherwise, the crediting to nonresident accounts of BCEAO banknotes, French banknotes, or banknotes issued by any other institute of issue that ma in ta ins an Operations Account with the French Treasury is prohibited. Imports and Import Payments Imports originating in or shipped from Portugal, Rhode- sia, and South Africa are prohibited. Imports from countries in the French Franc Area may in principle be made freely, although exceptionally special regulations may be issued. Im- ports from EEC countries, with minor exceptions, are liberal- ized and require only an import attestation. Most imports from other countries are subject to licensing. Imports from non-EEC countries outside the French Franc Area are admit- ted in accordance w i th an annual import program, deter- mined each year by the Directorate of Commerce. Under this program, global quotas are established up to which import 465 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution UPPER VOLTA licenses are issued for specified commodities. Impo r ts f rom Ghana are subject to special regulations. All import transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled w i th an authorized bank when their value ex- ceeds CFAF 500,000. The import licenses or import attesta- tions entitle importers to purchase the necessary exchange, but not earlier than eight days before shipment if a documen- tary credit is opened or eight days before the payment is due if the commodities have already been imported. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles to France (as defined above), Mo- naco, and the other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area are permitted freely; those to other countries are subject to exchange control approval, which for many invisibles has been delegated to the authorized banks. All payments to Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. Authorized banks and the Postal Adm in is tra t ion have been empowered to make transfers to foreign countries freely, on behalf of residents, up to CFAF 50,000 a t rans fe r. Payments for invisibles related to trade are permitted free ly when the basic trade transaction has been approved or does not require authorization. Transfers of income accruing to nonresidents in the form of profits, dividends, and royalties are also permitted. Residents trave l ing for tourism to countries other than France (as defined above), Monaco, and the other Operations Account countries of the French Franc Area may obtain an exchange allocation of an amount equiva- lent to CFAF 175,000 a person a t r ip (CFAF 87,500 for children under ten) for any number of trips a year; any foreign exchange in excess of CFAF 5,000 remaining a f ter return to Upper Volta must be surrendered. The basic allocation for travel abroad for business purposes is the equ iva lent of CFAF 20,000 a day, w i th a max imum of CFAF 400,000 a trip. Resident travelers going to foreign countries may take out up to a max imum of CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO banknotes, French banknotes, and banknotes issued by any in s t i tu te of issue that ma in ta ins an Operations Account w i th the French Treasury. Resident travelers to other countries of the French Franc Area may take out any amount in BCEAO banknotes, but if their destination is not to a member coun t ry of the West African Monetary Union, they must declare to the customs the amount taken out if it exceeds CFAF 150,000. Nonresident travelers may freely take out, in addition to any means of payment established in the ir name abroad, foreign banknotes up to the equivalent of CFAF 175,000 or, subject to the submission of appropriation (if it was either declared upon en t ry or acquired by drawing on a Financial Account in Francs or an Account in Foreign Currency or by exchange of foreign travelers checks, etc.), any larger amoun t. They may also take out any foreign means of payment other than banknotes acquired in Upper Volta by debit to a Finan- cial Account in Francs or an Account in Foreign Currency, again subject to submission of documentation. Finally, they may take out freely up to CFAF 25,000 in BCEAO bank- notes, French banknotes, and banknotes issued by Opera- tions Account countries. 466 Exports and Export Proceeds Exports to countries of the French Franc Area may be made freely but for statistical purposes certain agricultural products require a license f rom the Directorate of Commerce. Exports to Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohib- ited. Exports to all other countries are permitted freely but some also require a license. Certain commodities can be ex- ported in special circumstances only. Exports to Ghana are subject to special regulations. Export proceeds received in currencies other than those of France or another Operations Account coun t ry must be surrendered w i th in two mon ths of the date on wh ich the payment falls due (the due date stipu- lated in the commercial contract, which must not, in princi- ple, be later than 180 days a f ter arrival of the goods at their destination). All export transactions relating to foreign countries must be domiciled w i th an authorized bank when the ir va lue exceeds CFAF 500,000, and the exporter must sign a foreign exchange comm i tment and submit a customs cer t if ica t ion. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from transactions in invisibles w i th France (as defined above), Monaco, and other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area may be retained. All amoun ts due f rom residents of other countries in respect of services and all income earned in those countries f rom foreign assets must be collected and surrendered w i th in two mon ths of the due date. Such proceeds and earnings must not be received in or f rom Portugal, Rhodesia, or South Africa. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount of bankno tes and coins issued by the BCEAO, the Bank of France, or any bank of issue ma in ta in ing an Operations Ac- count w i th the French Treasury, as well as any amount of foreign bankno tes and coins (except gold coins) of countries outside the French Franc Area. Resident travelers must w i th in eight days a f ter re tu rn surrender to an authorized bank any foreign means of payment in excess of CFAF 5,000 that they bring in. Capital All capital movements between Upper Volta and Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa are prohibited. Capital move- men ts between Upper Volta and France (as defined above), Monaco, and other Operations Account countries in the French Franc Area are free of exchange control; capital trans- fers to all o ther countries require exchange control approval and are restricted, but capital receipts from such countries are permitted f ree ly. Special controls (additional to any exchange control re- qu i remen ts that may be applicable) are ma in ta ined over bor- row ing abroad, over inwa rd direct inves tment and all ou twa rd inves tmen t, and over the issuing, advertising, or o f fe r ing for sale of foreign securities in Upper Volta; these controls relate to the transactions themselves, not to pay- men ts or receipts.

Not for Redistribution other member countries of the West African Monetary Un- ion, and those other countries whose bank of issue is linked with the French Treasury by an Operations Account. Special controls are maintained also over imports and exports of gold, over the soliciting of funds for deposit with foreign private persons and foreign firms and institutions, and over all publicity aimed at placing funds abroad or at subscribing to real estate building operations abroad; these special con- trols do apply also to France (as defined above), Monaco, and the Operations Account countries. All investments abroad by residents of Upper Volta require prior authorization by the Minister of F inance .2 Foreign direct investments in Upper Volta 3 must be declared to the Minister of Finance before they are made. The Minister has a period of two mon ths from receipt of the declaration du r ing which he may request the postponement of the projects sub- mitted to him. The total or partial liquidation of either type of investment also is subject to prior declaration to the Minis- ter. Both the mak ing and the liquidation of investments, whether these are Upper Volta investments abroad or foreign investments in Upper Volta, must be reported to the Minister of Finance and the BCEAO w i th in 20 days following each operation. Direct investments are defined as investments im- plying control of a company or enterprise. Mere participation is not considered as direct investment, provided that it does not exceed 20 per cent in the capital of a company whose shares are quoted on a stock exchange. The issuing, advertising, or offering for sale of foreign secu- rities in Upper Volta requires prior authorization by the Min- ister of Finance. Exempt from authorization, however, are operations in connection w i th (1) loans backed by a guarantee from the Upper Volta Government and (2) shares that are similar to or may be substituted for securities whose issue, offering for sale, or sale in Upper Volta has previously been authorized. Borrowing by residents from nonresidents requires prior authorization by the Minister of Finance. The following are, however, exempt from this authorization: (1) loans constitut- ing a direct investment, which are subject to prior declara- tion, as indicated above; (2) loans taken up by industrial f irms to finance transactions abroad, by any type of firm to finance imports in to or exports from Upper Volta, or by approved international trad ing houses to finance international mer- chanting transactions; (3) loans contracted by authorized banks; (4) loans other than those mentioned above, when the total amount outstanding of these loans, inc lud ing the new borrowing, does not exceed CFAF 100 million for any one borrower, provided that the annual interest rate does not exceed the normal market rate and that the proceeds are immediately surrendered by the sale of foreign currency on the exchange market or debited to a Foreign Account in Francs.

Lending abroad is subject on ly to exchange control autho- rization by the BCEAO, acting on behalf of the Minister of Finance. The lending of CFA francs to nonresidents for peri- ods of up to two years, however, is freely permitted. Ordinance No. 70-074/PRES/PL-TP of December 31, 1970, the Investment Code, provides preferential treatment for foreign investment in Upper Volta. Two preferential cate- gories (A and B) are established, in accordance w i th which preferential treatment w i th respect to stable rates of taxes, duties, and other fiscal charges may be accorded to specified enterprises for periods of up to 25 years. The benefits under Category B are far more liberal than those under Category A; they are negotiable between the investor and the Govern- men t, and the enterprise accorded such benefits must be of exceptional importance to the development of the coun try. Law No. 25 /61 / AN set up an assistance fund for new indus- tries. Gold Residents are free to hold, acquire, and dispose of gold in any form in Upper Volta. Imports and exports of gold from or to any other coun t ry require prior authorization by the External Finance Bureau in the Ministry of Finance and Commerce. Exempt from this requirement are (1) imports and exports by or on behalf of the Treasury or the BCEAO; (2) imports and exports of manufac tured articles containing a minor qu an t i ty of gold (such as gold-filled or gold-plated articles); and (3) imports and exports by travelers of gold objects up to a combined weight of 500 grams. Both licensed and exempt imports of gold are subject to customs declara- tion. Changes during 1973 January 29. The commissions levied by the BCEAO on transfers to France (and other countries of the French Franc Area except those of the West African Monetary Union) were made identical w i th those on transfers to countries outside the French Franc Area. February 13. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the exchange rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02 was maintained; the effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously CFAF 255.785 = US$1, became CFAF 230.207 - US$1. February 23.

Not for Redistribution Exchange Rate System Imports and Import Payments URUGUAY On October 7, 1960 a par value for the Uruguayan Peso was established by Uruguay w i th the Fund; however, ex- change transactions no longer take place at rates based on that par value. There is a dual exchange market, consisting of a commercial market and a financial market. Payments and receipts in respect of imports, exports, fre igh t, and insurance on imports and exports, and most public sector exchange operations are settled in the commer- cial marke t, where the exchange rates are fixed (although adjusted from time to time), while all other permitted ex- change transactions take place in the financial market, in which the exchange rates fluctuate. On December 31, 1973 the buy ing and selling rates in the commercial market were Ur$928 and Ur$937 per US$1, respectively, and those in the financial market were Ur$925 and Ur$930 per US$1, respec- tively. The Central Bank supplies foreign exchange to the com- mercial banks for imports, and the proceeds from exports (valued at the officially assessed price or aforo where applica- ble) must be surrendered to the monetary authorities. l Com- mercial banks operate on their own account in the financial market, but are not permitted to exceed their overbought positions (in terms of U.S. dollars) of February 29, 1972 and must surrender any excess exchange holdings to the Central Bank. The application of exchange taxes (detracciones or reten- ciones) to the proceeds from certain traditional exports and the payment of subsidies through tax credit certificates (rein- tegros) on proceeds from certain nontraditional exports give rise to various effective buying rates that d iffer from the commercial market buying rate. Administration of Control Exchange transactions are carried out through authorized banks, bank ing houses, and the monetary authorities. The latter collect import surcharges and export taxes, hold the special deposits required for certain imports, and receive ex- port and import registrations. Prescription of Currency Payments between Uruguay and the countries w i th which Uruguay has concluded reciprocal credit agreements may be made through accounts maintained with each other by the central banks, w i th in the framework of the LAFTA mu l t i la t- eral clearing system; these countries are Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela.2 Settlements w i th other countries are made in U.S. dollars or other con- vertible currencies. 1 On March 1, 1967, a new Central Bank was established but some operations are still being carried out on its behalf by the Bank of the Republic. The term "monetary authorities" as used here refers to both banks taken together. 2 A reciprocal credit agreement w i th Brazil came i n to effect on June 1, 1974. All imports are subject to registration prior to the placing of orders abroad. The registrations are generally valid for 180 days, within which period goods must be cleared through customs. Certain imports are temporarily prohibited. Most imports are subject to an import surcharge (recargo), a special deposit (consignation), and /or prescribed terms of payment. Goods are classified in to nine categories; goods in one cate- gory bear no surcharge; goods in the other categories are subject to surcharges of 10, 30, 40, 60, 75, 90, 150, or 225 per cent, payable at the time of registration. Imports from LAFTA countries receive a full or partial exemption from the surcharges. Many imports are subject to special deposits in Uruguayan pesos of a certain percentage of the c.i.f. value; the deposit must be lodged w i th the monetary authorities at the time of registration and is refundable upon application after six months. For the second half of 1973, imports by each importer in each surcharge category up to 160 per cent of the U.S. dollar value of his import declarations (denuncias de importation) exempt from special deposits during the second half of 1971 were exempt from special deposits; in addition, special depos- its were waived for imports up to 69 per cent of individual imports in 1970 of certain special categories of imports. For imports in excess of the margin exempt from special deposits, the required deposit rate varied depending on the surcharge category applicable as of July 21, 1971. For imports free of surcharge, or imports w i th surcharges as of that date of up to 30 per cent, the special deposit was 450 per cent (315 per cent for imports from LAFTA countries; for imports with surcharges of more than 30 per cent and up to 90 per cent the rate was 900 per cent (630 per cent for imports from LAFTA countries); and for imports with surcharges above 90 per cent, the rate was 1,200 per cent (840 per cent for imports from LAFTA countries). The regime of special deposits is not applicable to goods designated as capital goods by Decree No. 482/971 of Au- gust 3, 1971. Imports by the public sector that have been approved by the Central Bank and imports financed with external loans at maturities specified below are among those exempt from special deposits. Most imports are subject, in addition to any customs du ty required, to an additional import du ty of 18 per cent of the c.i.f. value, payable upon customs clearance. The tax is not applied to imports originating in GATT or LAFTA countries, nor to imports of specified agencies and public institutions; in addition, an exemption of 100 per cent, 85 per cent, or 40 per cent of the applicable tax is provided for specified imports. All imports valued at over US$1.82 are subject to consular charges of Vie of 1 per cent of the peso amount resulting from the conversion of the f.o.b. value at a rate of Ur$55 per US$1; the amount of the charges is payable in foreign exchange at a rate of U r$l = US$2.10 (at a rate of U r$l = US$1 for private imports of petroleum and petro- leum products, alcohol, and tetraethyl lead, at a rate of Ur$l = US$0.50 for imports of the same commodities by the 469 ©International Monetary Fund.

In a few cases, the calculation is based on an officially assessed price, which usually is expressed in U.S. dollars per kilogram. Sales of foreign exchange for most private sector imports are prohibited unless m in imum f inanc ing requirements are fu lf i l led. At the end of 1973, foreign exchange was made available by the banking system for imports of goods other than capital goods on ly when payable 180 days or more a f ter the date of shipment; for capital goods valued at US$10,000 or less, c.i.f., the m in imum terms were two years, and for those in excess of US$10,000 f ive years, in either case applica- ble to 80 per cent of the c.i.f. value. For imports for wh ich f inanc ing under these conditions could not be obtained, the Central Bank could authorize the sale of exchange on a case-by-case basis. The sale of exchange was made at the earliest 15 days prior to the m a tu r i ty date. Provided that the importer had deposited the peso equivalent of the transaction w i th in 30 days after the date of approval of the application for customs clearance, the sale was made at the rate of ex- change in effect on the date of the deposit; for importers not mak ing the deposit w i th in the 30-day period, however, the sale of exchange was made at the rate in effect on the date of payment. In 1971 special arrangements were applied to certain other import payments and an exchange rate guarantee was given subject to the lodging of a peso deposit. Certain arrears have arisen in the implementation of these and subsequent ar- rangements. Payments for Invisibles Freight and insurance on imports and exports are settled in the commercial market. All other payments for invisibles are settled at the financial rate. There are basic exchange allowances for certain current invisibles. Thus, for tourism and other travel, the allocations (including fares) are as fol- lows: for travel to Argentina, $a 1,000 a person a trip; to Brazil, Cr$600 a person a trip; to Chile and Paraguay, either $a 1,750 or Cr$ 1,200 a person a trip; to other South American countries, US$25 a person a day, subject to a max imum of US$500 a person a trip; and to all other countries, US$30 a day, subject to a maximum of US$900 a person a trip. Tickets for foreign travel are subject to a stamp tax of Ur$100. Exchange for fam i ly remittances is restricted to close rela- tives w i th permanent residence abroad and is subject to a maximum of US$150 a mon th for each recipient and remittor, no recipient or remittor being permitted to receive or effect a remittance more than once a mon th. The sale of foreign exchange for students on scholarships abroad is limited to an amount per mon th no greater than the difference between 3 These charges are equivalent to 11.55 per cent, 5.50 per cen t, 2.75 per cen t, and 5.775 per cent, respectively. 470 US$500 and the amount of the mon th ly scholarship. For certain other invisibles, exchange is granted for the fu ll amoun ts due. Payments for other specified types of invisibles may, in principle, be made freely th rough the financial mar- ket, subject to the regulations issued by the Central Bank. However, at the end of 1973 imp lemen t ing regulations gov- erning sales of exchange for some of these had not yet been issued. For such transactions (remittances relating to the re- patriation of direct inves tmen ts and head office expenses), the f inanc ial market remained effectively closed. Remittances of p ro f i ts and dividends were limited to 10 per cent per annum of the invested capital expressed in the currency of origin. There are no l im i ta t ions on the export of foreign or domes- tic banknotes. Exports and Export Proceeds The proceeds of the principal exports are subject to taxes (detracciones or retenciones), which are w i thhe ld by the mon- etary au thor i t ies on the basis of either the f.o.b. value or the aforo value of the commodity concerned. The tax is stipulated in pesos per un it of export commod i ty, but it may not be more than 50 per cent or less than 0.01 per cent of the peso proceeds of the export, except that for exports of meat the stipulated max imum is 25 per cent while for wool the permitted limits are 2 per cent and 35 per cent of the f.o.b. value. The exchange proceeds of trad i t ional exports subject to taxes must be sur- rendered in f u ll to the mone tary au thor i t ies not later than 30 days a f ter shipment has been authorized (75 per cent for certain leather products); the proceeds from exports of non- trad i t ional products must be surrendered w i th in 60 days if the sale is on a cash basis (75 days for certain leather goods) or w i th in 210 days if the sale is made on credit. For certain exports, inc lud ing wool and hides, m in imum f.o.b. values (m in imum surrender prices or aforos) expressed in U.S. dol- lars per kilogram have been established for various grades and types. Subsidies in the form of tax credit certificates (reintegros) of up to 40 per cent of the f.o.b. value are granted on certain non t rad i t ional exports. Exports of certain types of beef and dairy cows, wool ewes, specified minerals ( inc lud ing iron, copper, zinc, a lum inum, and nickel), and protein concentrates used for animal feed are prohibited. As at the end of 1973 exports of certain animal fa ts, all types of sheepskin, an imal bristle, greasy wool, and skirted greasy wool were also temporarily prohibited. Ex- ports of wheat, sorghum, corn, and sunf lower seeds are pro- hibited f rom time to time. Proceeds from Invisibles All proceeds f rom invisibles may be held, utilized, or sold to the bank ing system. Department stores, hotels, and other tourist establishments are authorized to accept foreign cur- rencies at the rate preva i l ing in the f inanc ial marke t; the proceeds must be sold th rough the bank ing system. There are no l im i ta t ions on the import of foreign or domestic bank- notes. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Capital4 Inward capital transfers by either residents or nonresidents may be made freely through the bank ing system, and the exchange may be sold in the financial market anonymous ly; if the seller of foreign exchange identifies himself, however, he is entitled to repurchase in the financial market on any f u t u re date the same amount of foreign exchange. Exchange rate guarantees are in effect available on certain inward capital transfers, whether made by residents or nonresidents; these consist of swaps w i th the Central Bank. Outward capital transfers are subject to prior authorization; those of resi- dent-owned capital are restricted. All obligations in excess of US$1,000 that are contracted abroad by the private sector must be declared w i th in 30 days of the date of the contract. In addition, all foreign currency loans extended to the private sector by either foreign sources or domestic banks must be registered w i th the Central Bank w i th in 30 days of the signing of the contract in order to be eligible for servicing through the commercial market. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form in Uruguay or abroad, provided that the transactions are registered. Gold may be exported only if accompanied by evidence of prior importation. Any private purchases abroad for nonindustrial use, however, must be financed f rom the buyer's own exchange holdings. Imports and exports of gold for industrial use are settled through the commercial marke t. Changes during 1973 January 1.

Not for Redistribution VENEZUELA Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.265275 gram of f ine gold per Venezuelan Bolivar. No transactions take place at the par value. Ex- change transactions take place at the following rates. 1 The Central Bank of Venezuela purchases proceeds of the petro- leum and iron ore exporting companies at the rate of Bs 4.20 per US$ 1. Any proceeds from exports of cacao and coffee that are offered for sale to the Central Bank must be purchased by it at the rate of Bs 4.285 per US$1. The Central Bank sells exchange to the Government and its agencies and to the commercial banks (for sales to the public only) at Bs 4.285 per US$1 .2 The commercial banks purchase foreign exchange from the public at rates close to Bs 4.28 per US$1. Commercial banks must sell exchange to the public at Bs 4.30 per US$1 for all transactions; foreign banks may on ly sell foreign exchange that has not been obtained from the Central Bank. Some foreign exchange is also negotiated on the two stock ex- changes, where buy ing and selling rates usually are s l igh t ly below Bs 4.30 per US$1. Exchange houses are permitted to deal only in banknotes, coins, and travelers checks. The Cen- tral Bank offers swap facilities under which it buys U.S. dol- lars at Bs 4.27 and resells at Bs 4.30 after 180 days. Administration of Control There is no exchange control mechanism. Import and ex- port licenses, when required, are generally issued by the Min- istry of Development or the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, depending on the commodity. Under the terms of an agreement between the Government and the Central Bank, the latter has the responsibility of ensuring that a subsidy is applied to imports of wheat for human consumption and to certain exports of coffee and cacao. Prescription of Currency Payments between Venezuela and Argentina, Chile, Co- lombia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay may be made through accounts maintained w i th each other by the Central Bank of Venezuela and the central banks of the countries concerned. Proceeds from exports of petroleum and petroleum derivatives must not be received through these accounts. Otherwise, no prescription of currency require- ments are in force. Imports and Import Payments The import of certain goods is either prohibited or reserved for the Government; these include fu l ly assembled automo- biles, certain textiles, coffee, citrus fru i t, bananas, pineapples, melons, salt, opium, cigarette paper, natural pearls, and matches. In addition, a few other commodities require import licenses; quan t i ta t ive restrictions applicable irrespective of 1 The exchange rates given (except those for the Central Bank's swap transactions) are those applicable to sight d ra f ts on New York. 2 The Central Bank does not sell foreign exchange to the public but does sell m inor amoun ts to its staff and certain government officials, at the Bs 4.30 rate, for travel expenses and personal remittances. 474 origin are maintained on these items for protective purposes. Licenses are valid for all countries except Rhodesia and South Africa. Import licenses for some products are issued on the condition that the importer has purchased domestic products equal to a prescribed percentage of the quan t i ty import (con- tingentamiento). Imports of wheat for human consumption receive a subsidy of 25.55 per cent of the f.o.b. value, calculated at Bs 4.30 per US$1; they require an import license, and the Central Bank's Import Subsidy Office establishes eligibility for the subsidy. All other commodities are free from import licens- ing. Imports from Rhodesia and South Africa are prohibited. Import payments may be made freely. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles may be made freely; private sector purchases of exchange for this purpose are made from commercial banks or exchange houses. Resident and nonresi- dent travelers must on departure pay a travel tax of Bs 80 a person a trip; exemptions exist for children under seven, for- eign tourists, Venezuelan and foreign diplomats, and person- nel of international organizations. Travelers may freely export domestic and foreign currency. Exports and Export Proceeds Exports of certain fu rs and hides, scrap metals, and a few other commodities are prohibited. Licenses are required for the exportation of many other commodities, except petro- leum. Most export licenses are issued by the Ministry of Develop- ment, but those for coffee and cacao are granted by the Minis- try of Agriculture and Livestock. Exports of products containing subsidized imported wheat are subject to special arrangements to ensure that the subsidy received is repaid. The export of gold and precious stones requires an export license issued by the M in is try of Finance. The petroleum and iron ore exporting companies must surrender to the Central Bank export proceeds, to the extent of their local currency requirements (including taxes), at a rate of Bs 4.20 per US$1. Otherwise, there are no surrender requirements for export proceeds or other exchange receipts. Exporters of coffee and cacao may (but need not) sell exchange proceeds to the Cen- tral Bank at Bs 4.285 per US$1; they may receive an export subsidy calculated to prevent the f.o.b. bolivar prices of these products in Venezuelan ports from fa l l ing below specified m in imum amounts regardless of external prices for these products. Eligibility for this subsidy is maintained even if the exchange proceeds are not surrendered. In principle, the ben- efit of these arrangements based on guaranteed minimum prices may be extended to firms processing domestic coffee or cacao for export. All exports to Rhodesia and South Africa are prohibited, as are exports of petroleum and m i l i ta ry equipment to the People's Republic of China and Nor th Korea. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Proceeds from Invisibles Exchange receipts from invisibles are freely disposable. Travelers may freely import domestic and foreign currency, w i th the exception that the Currency Law prohibits the im- portation for commercial purposes of foreign coins other than gold coins. The importation of Venezuelan gold coins is re- served for the Central Bank. Capital All capital transfers are permitted freely. Brokerage activ- ity in Venezuela, however, in shares or un i ts of foreign invest- ment trusts or mutual funds is prohibited. There is no registration procedure for incoming capital. The Central Bank regulates bank credit to nonresidents and companies whose capital is more than 50 per cent owned by physical persons or companies that are resident or domiciled abroad. The General Banking Law of December 30, 1970 authorizes the Government to regulate bank credit to companies whose capital is more than 40 per cent owned by nonresident or foreign physical persons or companies. This law also provides special regulations for foreign banks operating in Venezuela. Gold Venezuelan gold coins are legal tender but do not circulate. Residents may hold, acquire, and sell gold coins in Venezuela for numismatic and investment purposes. The Central Bank does not deal in gold with the public, but gold coins, medal- lions, and bars are freely negotiated between licensed import- ers, exchange houses, and the public. Commercial banks may freely negotiate gold coins among themselves and w i th other residents but do not normally deal in gold w i th the public. Imports and exports of monetary gold are reserved for the Central Bank, as is the import of gold coins that are legal VENEZUELA tender in Venezuela. Other imports and exports of gold re- qu ire licenses. Imports require licenses from the Ministry of Finance and in certain cases also from the Ministry of Devel- opment, while exports are licensed by the M in is try of Finance only. The law prescribes a license for all imports and exports of gold by anyone not registered at the M in is try of Develop- ment as an industrial user, but in practice imports and ex- ports by private persons are permitted free of license. Imports of gold coins and of gold bars and ingots weighing more than 12 kilograms are free of customs du ty; all other gold imports are subject to du ty at vary ing rates. All imports of nonmone- tary gold are subject to consular duties ranging from 2 per cent to 3V2 per cent ad valorem. Changes during 1973 February 13. Venezuela became a signatory to the Carta- gena Agreement of the Andean Group. It forma l ly became a member of the Group late in 1973. February 19. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Venezuela changed the buy ing rate of Bs 4.30 per U.S. dollar to Bs 4.20 and that of Bs 4.385 per U.S. dollar to Bs 4.285. All other buy ing and selling rates were also appreciated by 10 centavos per US$1. May 1. A new customs ta r i ff based on the Brussels Tariff Nomenclature came in to force. The number of items subject to import licensing was reduced from 580 to about 100. September 26. An Export Incentive Law was promulgated. It provided for the promotion of nontraditional exports by a system of bearer tax credit certificates (CATs) that were freely negotiable. The law came in to effect on September 28. September 26. A law was promulgated creating an Export Finance Fund. It provided for credit facilities for exports of nontraditional goods and services of national origin that were considered to have priority for economic development pur- poses. The law came in to effect on September 28. 475 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution VIET-NAM used for investment. Their use is subject to the approval of the Directorate-General of Exchange. Investments financed from Capital Accounts generally are not covered by the In- vestment Law of 1963 (see section on Capital, below), and proceeds from the liquidation of such investments are cred- ited to Capital Accounts unless the Ministry of National Economy has declared them eligible for the privileges of the law. Balances in Capital Accounts are negotiable between nonresident foreigners. Imports and Import Payments The bulk of imports comes under one of three headings: (1) imports financed with funds from the U.S. Agency for In- ternational Development (AID); (2) imports financed from Viet-Nam's own foreign exchange resources; and (3) "third- country-financed imports," i.e., imports financed with French, German, and Japanese loans, or French export credit. In principle, products imported under the AID pro- grams are not included among imports that are financed otherwise. However, when AID financing proves insufficient for obtaining imports of essential products, such imports may be financed from Viet-Nam's official exchange reserves. Many imports are prohibited. Except for those commodities also financed by the U.S. AID programs and prohibited commodities, all imports fi- nanced w i th Viet-Nam's own exchange are effected through the "Import Credit" procedure, under which they are exempt from license. All other imports require licenses. Certain im- ports are subject to advance deposits and /or import sur- charges. Some imports are permitted without foreign exchange (sans Exchange Rate System 1 No par value for the Vietnamese Piastre has been estab- lished w i th the Fund. The exchange rate structure is based on an official rate and a special rate, both of which may be adjusted from time to time; on December 31, 1973 these rates stood at VNS550 and VN$455, respectively, per US$1. Dif- ferent effective exchange rates arise from the application of certain subsidies and commissions. Payments and receipts must be effected through the autho- rized banks. Authorized banks are allowed to engage in for- ward buy ing or selling of foreign exchange in the domestic or foreign exchange markets, but only in relation to payments for imports and only in certain specified currencies. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the National Bank of Viet-Nam (Directorate-General of Exchange). Most remit- tances must have the prior approval of the Directorate-Gen- eral of Exchange; the au thor i ty to approve some payments for private invisibles has been delegated to the authorized banks. Imports financed by U.S. aid require licenses and are subject to special contracts or procurement procedures. Import li- censes are issued by the Ministry of Economy (Directorate of Commercial Aid) and are countersigned by the National Bank (Directorate of Foreign Aid). Licenses are generally not required for imports financed w i th Viet-Nam's own ex- change. Prescription of Currency With the exception of import payments under the French credit insurance program, all payments must be made in U.S. dollars. Proceeds from exports to France, the Federal Repub- lic of Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom must be received in the currency of the country concerned. Other receipts may be accepted either in a currency quoted by the National Bank (deutsche mark, French francs, Japanese yen, or pounds sterling) or in any other convertible currency, provided that prior to repatriation such other currencies are converted in to a currency quoted by the National Bank. Nonresident Accounts Nonresidents may maintain accounts with banks, subject to the approval of the Directorate-General of Exchange. Nonresident Accounts in Free Piastres may be freely cred- ited with the proceeds from the sale of convertible exchange and may be freely debited for most payments to residents. A category of nonresident accounts, Capital Accounts, covers piastres owned by nonresident foreigners that may not be transferred abroad. Balances in Capital Accounts may be 1 Following the replacement of equalization taxes (taxes de perequation) by import surcharges on December 29, 1973, exchange subsidies for exports were eliminated in Janua ry 1974 and replaced by a subsidy not invo lv ing a mu l t ip le currency practice. On Janua ry 12, 1974 the special exchange rate for certain tied commod i ty aid impor ts from the United States was eliminated and replaced by a fiscal subsidy outside the scope of the exchange system. As a result of these modifications, the exchange rate was un if ied at VNS560 per US$1. 476 imports under suppliers' credits are subject to a different type of deposit (consignation). Payments for Invisibles Most payments for invisibles require approval by the Directorate-General of Exchange. Students approved by a special commission are granted US$80 a mon th for study in the Republic of China or Hong Kong and US$150 a month for study elsewhere; they are also granted allocations for tuition and medical fees and for extraordinary expenses. Stu- dents participating in short-term training courses abroad are granted up to US$130 a month. Foreign specialists employed in Viet-Nam may transfer up to 50 per cent of their salary every month, but not more than US$600 a mon th. In principle, foreign firms are generally permitted to trans- fer up to 70 per cent of their net annual profit after tax, after examination of their accounts and after deduction of any losses in previous years. Profit transfers by foreign enterprises established or expanded between February 14, 1963 and June 2, 1972 under the terms of the 1963 Investment Law are governed by the provisions of that law unless they meet the requirements of the "Foreign Exchange Working Capital Sys- tem" (see section on Capital, below). Although dividends declared in Viet-Nam and accruing to nonresidents and for- eign residents may in principle be transferred abroad, under the terms of the 1963 Investment Law transfers of profits and dividends are limited to 20 per cent annually of the declared capital. Net annual profits after tax from projects covered by the new Investment Law, Law No. 4 /72, may be transferred without limit. Each resident authorized to travel abroad is entitled to purchase the following amounts of foreign exchange at the official rate: travelers to the Khmer Republic and Laos US$30 a day, with a maximum of US$300 a person a trip, and travelers to other countries US$40 a day, with a maximum of US$2,400 a person a trip. The allocations mentioned may be supplemented by the equivalent of US$40 in foreign bank- notes. Travelers are permitted to take with them up to VN$5,000 in Vietnamese banknotes. Foreign exchange not used by foreign travelers may be re-exported. Exports and Export Proceeds Most exports do not require a license; they must be domi- ciled (registered) with an authorized bank, however, which is responsible for the repatriation of the foreign exchange. All exports to communist countries, exports to any destination of manufactured or semimanufactured products originally im- ported into Viet-Nam, gold, rice, rice products, and certain other items are prohibited; the prohibition does not apply to imported goods that have been processed in Viet-Nam, pro- vided that the value added corresponds to, or exceeds, a specified proportion of the export price. Exporters are al- lowed to retain in EFAC (Exportations-Frais Accessoires) accounts 10 per cent of their total export proceeds for the settlement of incidental expenses related to the export trans- action. Most exports enjoy subsidies on the basis of the de- clared export value in terms of Vietnamese piastres. VIET-NAM Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles must be surrendered at the official rate. Foreign military personnel and official U.S. civilian person- nel serving in Viet-Nam are paid in scrip ("military payment certificates" or MPCs), which can be exchanged for piastres at the official rate only through special official channels (mili- tary banking facilities). They are not permitted to possess foreign banknotes or travelers checks in Viet-Nam, but there are military banking facilities under which eligible foreign persons may open accounts in piastres, MPCs, or U.S. dollars at two U.S. banks in Saigon. A traveler entering Viet-Nam may bring in any amount of foreign exchange and up to VN$5,000 in Vietnamese bank- notes. Foreign military and civilian personnel (government officials) must surrender on arrival any foreign banknotes they bring into Viet-Nam. Capital Under general regulations, capital may be imported with- out formalities, but foreign investors must register their capi- tal with the Vietnamese authorities and agree on the terms of the investment in order to be able to repatriate their capital and to transfer profits. Under the Investment Law of 1963, special benefits could be accorded to new foreign investments in those sectors of the economy that are given high priority. The minimum investment in agriculture was established at VN$0.5 million, and in industry at VN$1 million. Imports of equipment and spare parts needed by foreign undertakings covered by the law were exempt from customs duties. Foreign technicians employed by these enterprises were exempt from income tax for 2 years. Foreign investments were free of taxes on profit, securities, and real estate for specified periods of time. The new investments were not subject to any national- ization measures for the first 15 years from the date of the written authorization granted to the investor; they were ac- corded the same treatment as that applicable to domestic investments. The law provided for the transfer of profits at an annual rate of up to 20 per cent of the invested capital, and for the repatriation of the original investment after 5 years at an annual rate of up to 20 per cent if the capital was newly imported (after 20 years for investment of foreign-owned cap- ital previously held in Viet-Nam). A new Investment Law promulgated on June 2, 1972 has superseded the Investment Law of 1963. The provisions of the 1963 law, however, are still applicable to the enterprises which were governed by them. Under the new law, which mainly adds new fiscal benefits to the provisions of the 1963 law, fiscal incentives are granted to new investments whether financed in Vietnamese currency or in foreign exchange brought from abroad, provided that (1) the investments are made in a "priority sector" and (2) that the initial capital is over VN$10 million in the primary sector and over VN$20 million in the secondary and tertiary sectors. Besides fiscal exemptions the foreign enterprises enjoying the benefits of the law are authorized (1) to transfer abroad total net annual profits and (2) to repatriate after five years of operation the capital invested, in annual installments of 20 per cent. 477 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution VIET-NAM Investments not covered by either Investment Law nor by the regime described in the following paragraph are subject to the regulations and case-to-case decisions of the Director- ate-General of Exchange, which normally authorizes the transfer of up to 70 per cent of net annual profits after taxes but does not permit disinvestment; such investments are not eligible for the above-mentioned tax exemptions. Under a "Foreign Exchange Working Capital System," for- eign capital imported in the form of direct investment or as medium-term and long-term credit in cash or in kind may be registered with the National Bank and treated as follows. Capital must be brought from abroad and sold through au- thorized banks, where it is credited to a "Foreign Exchange Working Account.'* Profits, dividends, and interest on such capital may be transferred annually up to a maximum of 20 per cent of the registered amount and repatriation may be made up to an annual maximum of 25 per cent of the regis- tered capital. Imports and exports of capital normally are made at the official rate. Gold Within Viet-Nam, the holding of gold and all transactions in gold are subject to licensing, but the controls are not rigidly enforced and unlicensed holdings of gold by individu- als are tolerated. Only the National Bank is empowered to import and export gold. All domestic transactions in gold are subject to a luxury tax of 10 per cent on the sale value or the manufacturing cost. The export of gold by physical or juridi- cal persons other than the National Bank is prohibited. The import of gold by physical or juridical persons other than the Table of Exchange Rates (as at December 31, 1973 )2 National Bank is also prohibited, with the following excep- tions: (1) Vietnamese settled in Laos may, when returning to Viet-Nam, bring in up to 13 taels 4 of gold in the form of jewelry; (2) residents may import gold without allocation of foreign exchange, provided that they have an import license and pay a customs du ty of 130 per cent and an equalization tax of VNS100 per US$1; (3) nonresidents may, without allo- cation of foreign exchange, bring in to Viet-Nam any quan- t i ty of gold, provided that its en try is declared and that it is deposited in safe custody with an authorized bank; the util- ization of such gold is subject to prior authorization by the Directorate-General of Exchange, and if it is sold in Viet-Nam, the sales proceeds must be credited to a Capital Account. Changes during 1973 January 2. A general export subsidy of VN$50 per US$1 surrendered was established, replacing the existing general subsidy which consisted of the differential between the pre- vailing official exchange rate and VN$500 per US$1. January 26. The official exchange rate was changed from VN$465 to VN$475 per US$1. The special rate was changed from VN$320 to VN$330 per US$1. February 19.

The deposit was to be collected at the time of opening of the letter of credit and retained by the National Bank for six months. February 23. Communique No. 8 /BKT /BTC abrogated the procedure whereby importers undertaking imports through the "Import Credit" procedure were allowed to pay only the import value minus VN$100 per US$1 at the time of allocation of the import credit, and the balance upon utili- zation of the letter of credit. Henceforth, the fu ll domestic currency counterpart amount against the foreign exchange amount granted under the "Import Credit" procedure was to be collected. February 23. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the National Bank announced that it would maintain the official exchange rate at VN$475 per US$1. March 3. Communique No. 12/BKT increased the advance import deposit requirement established on February 22 to VN$600 per US$1 of import value. March 3. Communique No. 13/BKT again allowed the issuance of letters of credit for imports of textile products financed with Viet-Nam's own exchange resources. At the same time, an advance import deposit of VN$600 per US$1 of import value was required for all textile imports financed w i th Viet-Nam's own exchange resources. The deposit was to be held for six months from the opening of the letter of credit. In addition, a temporary equalization tax of VN$160 per US$1 was imposed on textiles held in customs warehouses on February 24, 1973. March 7. The special exchange rate was changed from VN$330 to VN$360 per US$1. The official rate remained unchanged. March 7. Communique No. 15/BKT raised the advance import deposit for imports under the Commercial Import Program to VN$100 per US$1, to be held for six months, from VN$30 per US$1 held for three months. The deposit was to be collected at the time an application for an import license was filed. March 14. The special export subsidy of VN$25 per US$1 was granted on two additional items, iron bars and glass tubes for medical purposes. April 27. The official exchange rate was changed from VN$475 to VN$485 per US$1; the special exchange rate was changed from VN$360 to VN$380 per US$1. April27.

The official exchange rate was changed from VN$525 to VN$535 per US$1; the special rate was changed from VN$425 to VN$440 per US$1. November 22. Decree No. 486 established import sur- charges on v ir tua l ly all items in new ly established import lists C (less essential imports, inc lud ing textile goods) and D (other imports), so that total customs levies (consisting of the statutory tariff and the surcharge) amounted to 100 per cent ad valorem on virtually all items; certain motor vehicles were subject to a customs levy of 200 per cent. For certain items in lists C and D, the import surcharges replaced the equaliza- tion taxes on import payments. December 6. The official exchange rate was changed from VN$535 to VN$550 per US$1; the special exchange rate was changed from VN$440 to VN$455 per US$1. December 29. As part of a series of exchange reform mea- sures, Decree No. 544 eliminated all equalization taxes on import payments (which had ranged from VN$75 to VN$300 per US$1, in addition to a variable equalization tax). Ad valorem import surcharges to be collected at the time of customs clearance of the imports were substituted, except for certain imports financed by U.S. aid. 479 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Exchange Rate System Payments for Invisibles WESTERN SAMOA No par value for the Western Samoa Tala has been estab- lished w i th the Fund. A central rate of WS$1 = US$1.67736 has been established, corresponding to 1.23565 grams of f ine gold or SDR 1.39045, respectively, per WS$1. The interven- tion currency is the U.S. dollar and Western Samoa avails itself of wider margins. On December 31, 1973, the Bank of Western Samoa's buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were US$1.6617 and US$1.6396, respectively, per WS$1. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered by the Minister of Fi- nance operating as the exchange control au thor i ty; the Minis- ter may delegate his approval au tho r i ty to the Financial Secretary, who in turn may delegate part of his powers to authorized banks. All payments to nonresidents of Western Samoa require the approval of the Ministry of Finance. The M in is try, however, has delegated to the Bank of Western Samoa, the only authorized bank, au tho r i ty to approve cer- tain payments up to any amount and certain other payments up to specified amounts. Prescription of Currency Western Samoa has ceased to be a Scheduled Territory in terms of the U.K. Exchange Control Act, 1947 but under current U.K. exchange control regulations continues to be regarded as a country of the Overseas Sterling Area. Most settlements with Sterling Area territories take place in Ster- ling Area currencies, but there are no prescriptions as to the currencies in which payments to or from nonresidents of Western Samoa must be made or received. Nonresident Accounts Payments for certain invisibles, such as overseas contrac- tual obligations and insurance, are approved automatically by the Bank of Western Samoa up to any amount or within limits determined by the Ministry of Finance. Payments in excess of these limits as well as payments for all other invisi- bles require the prior approval of the Ministry of Finance. Remittances in respect of study abroad are freely authorized. The Ministry of Finance approves up to any amount the transfer of genuine income derived locally from pensions, rents, interests, and dividends by persons permanently resi- dent overseas. Residents traveling to American Samoa, whether for business or private purposes, are entitled to a foreign currency allowance equivalent to US$50 a person a quarter; an additional allowance of US$15 a day is provided to cover hotel expenses. The basic travel allowance for other countries is equivalent to WS$10 a person a day, subject to a limit of WS$ 1,000. The Ministry of Finance grants supple- mentary allocations when evidence of genuine need is pro- vided. Resident travelers may take out foreign banknotes, as part of their foreign currency allowance, up to WS$20 a per- son a trip. Resident and nonresident travelers may take out any amount in domestic currency. Exports and Export Proceeds V ir tua l ly all exports require the prior approval of the Min- is try of Finance. Exports may be prohibited by the Director of Agriculture on grounds of low quality, or by order of the Head of State to alleviate domestic shortages. Copra exports are controlled by the Copra Board and banana exports by the Produce Marketing Division of the Ministry of Agriculture. Export proceeds must be surrendered to the Bank of Western Samoa w i th in a reasonable time after shipment. Where excep- tional circumstances exist, the Ministry of Finance may waive this requirement for certain export items. No distinction is made between the accounts of residents and nonresidents of Western Samoa. Proceeds from Invisibles Imports and Import Payments The import of a few commodities is prohibited from all sources for reasons of security or health. Other commodities may be imported from any source. Each licensed commercial importer receives an annual allocation of foreign exchange, to be taken up on a quarterly basis, which may be used freely for the import of any commodity that is not prohibited except automobiles. The allocations are made by the Ministry of Finance and communicated to the Bank of Western Samoa; the la t ter automatically provides the foreign exchange re- quired for import payments upon submission of documentary evidence. Persons who are not licensed importers may import any commodity freely up to WS$100 a person a year but require the prior approval of the Ministry of Finance for imports of higher value. The import of motor vehicles, other than for exclusive use in plantation work, requires an advance deposit of 50 per cent of the retail value. 480 All receipts from invisibles must be surrendered to the Bank of Western Samoa. Resident travelers must on return sell to the Bank all foreign currency brought in. Resident and nonresident travelers may bring in any amount in foreign and domestic banknotes. Capital All outward capital transfers by residents require the spe- cific approval of the Ministry of Finance and capital received by residents must be surrendered to the Bank of Western Samoa. Inward capital remittances do not normally require approval, but borrowing abroad by nonbank residents does. The transfer of legacies from estates of deceased local resi- dents due to beneficiaries permanently residing overseas is approved up to a limit of WS$ 10,000 a year. The Bank of Western Samoa approves transfers of gifts to relatives and dependents, either for special fam i ly occasions or by way of maintenance, up to WS$200 a year for each family group. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Foreign investments in specified activities in Western Samoa are encouraged. The Enterprises Incentive Act No. 27 /1965, as amended in 1969, makes provision for the granting of certain relief of customs duties, income tax, and business license fees to persons engaged in approved enterprises. Both the repatriation of capital and profit remittances on foreign capital are subject to approval by the Minister of Finance; such approval is normally granted. Gold Residents may freely purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form. There are no restrictions on imports or exports of gold in any form. Changes during 1973 January 1. Foreign exchange allocations for importers came in to effect which were set at levels below those of 1972. Subsequently, additional allocations were granted which brought 1973 allocations up to about the 1972 level. February 20. Following the announcement that the U.S. WESTERN SAMOA dollar was being devalued, the Western Samoa tala remained pegged to the New Zealand dollar, at the previously existing ratio of WS$0.8076 = $NZ 1. The par value of the latter currency was maintained in terms of gold. As a result, the tala appreciated in terms of the U.S. dollar. The buying and sell- ing rates for the U.S. dollar, previously US$1.4937 and US$1.4662 per WS$1, became US$1.6617 and US$1.6396 per WS$1. May 10. Advance import deposits were required for motor vehicles, other than for use exclusively in plantation work; the buyer had to deposit 50 per cent of the retail value at the time of ordering. July 9. Western Samoa discontinued the fixed exchange rate relationship of the Western Samoa tala with the New Zealand dollar and maintained the effective parity relation- ship for the U.S. dollar unchanged at WS$1 = US$1.67736. July 26. A central rate of WS$1 = US$1.67736 was estab- lished. Western Samoa also availed itself of wider margins. The U.S. dollar became the intervention currency. The effec- tive parity relationship for the U.S. dollar remained un- changed. 481 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Exchange Rate System Exports and Export Proceeds YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC The currency of the Yemen Arab Republic is the Yemen Rial, which is issued by the Central Bank of Yemen. No par value has been established with the Fund. All transactions take place in a free market at a f luc tua t ing exchange rate. On December 31, 1973 the rate for the U.S. dollar was about YRls 4.50 per US$1. Administration of Control Exchange control is administered on behalf of the Minister of Economy by the Central Bank of Yemen, which has the au tho r i ty to grant exchange licenses and licenses for imports and exports. The only commercial banks and authorized deal- ers are the Yemen Bank for Reconstruction and Development and four branches of foreign commercial banks. Prescription of Currency Settlements under bilateral payments arrangements l are made in the currencies and through the accounts provided for by these arrangements. Otherwise, settlements are usually made in pounds sterling or U.S. dollars. Imports and Import Payments Imports from Israel are prohibited. Imports of a few com- modities are reserved for the Government. All other imports require import licenses. These are issued freely for all com- modities for which government agencies or firms with govern- ment participation do not have the exclusive right of importation. In addition to a license, the importation of cer- tain commodities requires the permission of the competent m in is try or, for certain textiles, of the Sanaa Textile Factory. Imports that are financed by the importer w i th his own for- eign exchange held abroad also require an import license. Importers who have obtained an import license may obtain the necessary foreign exchange from the local banks or the free market. In addition to the applicable customs du ty, im- ports are subject to a defense tax of 5 per cent ad valorem and a statistical tax of 2 per cent ad valorem. Payments for Invisibles Payments for current invisibles may be made freely when financed from foreign currency accounts held at home or abroad by exporters of goods or services, or when effected in foreign banknotes. All other payments in respect of invisibles require an exchange license issued by the Central Bank. Such licenses are issued freely for virtually all current invisibles, including tourist travel. Travelers may freely take out any amount in domestic or foreign banknotes. 1 The Yemen A rab Republic ma in ta ins a bilateral payments arrangement w i th Egyp t. 482 Exports to Israel are prohibited. For statistical purposes only, all exports require registration forms, which are issued freely by banks; export licenses are not required. Exporters are not required to surrender the foreign exchange proceeds; these may be retained in foreign currency accounts with do- mestic banks. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles need not be surrendered but may be retained in foreign currency accounts with domestic com- mercial banks. Travelers may freely bring in any amount in domestic or foreign banknotes. Capital In principle, all capital transfers require prior approval and capital proceeds must be surrendered; in practice, no restric- tions are imposed on inward or outward capital transfers. Both domestic and foreign investment are regulated by Law No. 13 of 1970. Foreign investors in the Yemen Arab Repub- lic are free to transfer abroad any desired proportion of their net profits after taxes or of their capital. Gold A 20-rial gold coin has been issued, which is not legal tender and does not circulate in the Yemen Arab Republic. By virtue of Ministerial Decree No. 21 /1973 residents are free to purchase, hold, and sell gold in any form in the Yemen Arab Republic and to import or export gold in any form without an import, export or exchange license. Changes during 1973 February. Following the announcement on February 12, 1973 that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the Yemen authorities decided to allow the rate of the rial to be deter- mined by market forces. Previously, the rate had been stable for some time at YRls 5.00 = US$1. By February 25, the rial had appreciated in the free market to about YRls 4.50 per U.S. dollar. The Central Bank then announced its intention to stabilize the rate at this level, provided that only a mini- mum of market intervention was required to do so. March 14. Pending the promulgation of a law that would formally repeal certain regulations that were no longer being enforced (see August 15, below), the Central Bank issued a circular providing the following: (1) All private imports henceforth required an import li- cense; previously, imports financed by a private importer with his own foreign exchange held abroad were exempt from licensing. (2) Banks no longer required the prior approval of the Central Bank to make payments for current invisibles, pro- vided these were financed out of foreign currency accounts, whether held at home or abroad, or settled in foreign bank- notes. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC (3) The surrender requirements for export proceeds were terminated. Exporters of all commodities were permitted to retain in full their foreign exchange proceeds in resident for- eign currency accounts with domestic commercial banks. Bal- ances could be used freely in accordance with (2) above. (4) The same facilities as granted to exporters by the mea- sure under (3) above were extended also to the recipients of foreign currency proceeds from current invisibles. May 27. Ministerial Decree No. 21 /1973 revoked Regula- tion No. 5 of 1967 which restricted domestic dealing in gold and the import and export of gold. The Regulation had not been enforced for some time. August 15. A draft law was introduced to revoke a number of other trade control and exchange control regulations that had not been enforced for some time. Among other things, the import and export of domestic and foreign currency by travelers would become formally exempt from prior authori- zation by the Central Bank. By the end of the year, the law had not yet been enacted. 483 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN Exchange Rate System The currency of the People's Democratic Republic of Ye- men is the Yemeni Dinar, which is issued by the Bank of Yemen and is defined as equivalent to 2.13281 grams of f ine gold. No par value for the Yemeni dinar has been established w i th the Fund. The central rate is YD 1 = US$2.89524 or US$1 = YD 0.345395. On December 31, 1973, the National Bank of Yemen's buy ing and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were YD 0.343 and YD 0.350. Administration of Control The administration of exchange control is carried out by the Bank of Yemen's (the central bank) General Department for Exchange Control through the Foreign Exchange Com- mittee, which has delegated certain powers to the Director of Exchange Control, a member of the Committee. The Ministry of Economy and Indus t ry issues import and export licenses; those for gold and other precious metals require the prior approval of the Director of Exchange Control. Exchange transactions must be carried out through the intermediary of authorized dealers (licensed commercial banks approved by the Director of Exchange Control); at present the only com- mercial bank and authorized dealer is the National Bank of Yemen. Except for payments for imports against letters of credit or documents, which may be approved by the autho- rized dealer, and for payments by the oil refinery, all pay- ments for imports (including those of precious metals) require the prior approval of the Director of Exchange Control. Two public corporations and a semipublic corporation are en- gaged in foreign trade (see section on Imports and Import Payments, below). The oil refinery is treated as a resident entity but in its operation generally is not affected by the existing exchange and trade controls. Prescription of Currency The People's Democratic Republic of Yemen has ceased to be a Scheduled Territory in terms of the U.K. Exchange Control Act, 1947 but under current U.K. exchange control regulations continues to be regarded as a country of the Over- seas Sterling Area. Exchange transactions must be carried out th rough the intermediary of authorized dealers in accordance w i th prescription of currency regulations that are in certain respects similar to those applicable in the United Kingdom. All payments to Israel and Rhodesia are prohibited. Export proceeds and certain receipts from invisibles must be received in prescribed currencies * and surrendered to authorized deal- ers. Payments for imports must be made in prescribed curren- cies. Nonresident Accounts Nonresident accounts may be held by certain persons not resident in the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. The 1 Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, deutsche ma rk, French francs, I ta l ian lire, Ne ther lands guilders, pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. 484 principal type of nonresident account is the External Account in Yemeni Dinars. External Accounts may be credited with proceeds from convertible foreign currency transferred from abroad, with bank interest payable on such accounts, and with balances from other External Accounts. Transfers from abroad must be in the form of bank drafts; the accounts cannot be credited with payments in the form of foreign banknotes (unless they have been declared to the customs on entry), or with locally raised or locally earned funds. External Accounts may be debited for any payments to residents, for transfers to other External Accounts, and for payments abroad in any convertible currency. Transfers abroad from Nonresident Accounts in Yemeni dinars require the prior approval of the Exchange Control Department. The Foreign Exchange Committee may direct any payment to a nonresi- dent to a Blocked Account. Except with the Committee's prior approval, Blocked Accounts may be debited only for purchases of specified securities. Imports and Import Payments With minor exceptions, all imports other than those of the oil refinery require individual licenses. Most overland mer- chanting trade with the Yemen Arab Republic is also exempt from the licensing requirements. There are special regulations governing merchanting trade with neighboring countries. Im- ports from Israel and Rhodesia are prohibited. An import program is drawn up annually, but its quotas are operated flexibly. Payments for imports on a c.& f. basis against letters of credit or documentary drafts can be made by authorized dealers w i thout the prior approval of the Director of Ex- change Control; most other forms of payment for imports require no approval. Insurance on imports must be effected locally. A Board of Trade is in charge of the trading activities of the nationalized companies. The National Company for For- eign Trade has a monopoly over imports of flour, sugar, wheat, rice, ghee, cooking oil, tea, and cigarettes. The Na- tional Import Company Ltd. imports certain consumer goods not mentioned in Law No. 37 of 1969. The National Com- pany for Home Trade is the sole importer of automobiles and other vehicles, all government requirements, and most re- quirements of the public hospitals, as well as other specified items. Imports into and exports from the free port zones within the port of Aden are free of exchange and trade con- trols (except in respect of transactions between these zones and the rest of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen) and are exempt from customs duties. Payments for Invisibles All payments for invisibles require prior approval by the Director of Exchange Control. The basic exchange allowance for tourism, which residents may take up without applying for exchange control approval, is the equivalent of YD 125 a person a trip in travelers checks, drafts, and foreign notes and coins (50 per cent of this amount for children under ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ten). 2 Allowances for other types of travel are granted on the merits of the application. Foreign employees of approved enterprises and the oil refinery are allowed to remit abroad up to 50 per cent and three eighths, respectively, of their total earnings (net of taxes). All insurance is nationalized; existing policies have been transferred to the National Insurance and Reinsurance Company, and payments abroad in respect of premiums are not permitted. Travelers may take out the equivalent of YD 5 in domestic banknotes and up to the equivalent of YD 125 in travelers checks, foreign banknotes, or other foreign means of payment. Furthermore, nonresi- dents may take out any foreign exchange declared upon en t ry. Exports and Export Proceeds Most exports, including petroleum products, are exempt from licenses. All exports to Israel and Rhodesia are prohib- ited. Except for exports to the Yemen Arab Republic speci- fied by the Foreign Exchange Committee, export proceeds must be received in prescribed currencies within six months of shipment and must be sold to authorized dealers upon receipt. The proceeds of exports or re-exports to the Yemen Arab Republic may be surrendered in the national currency of the importing country. Proceeds from Invisibles All claims of residents for services rendered to nonresidents must be collected in foreign currency (or received from an External Account) when due and surrendered to authorized dealers. Travelers may freely bring in foreign banknotes but not more than YD 5 in domestic currency. Capital V ir tua l ly all capital payments and transactions require prior approval. Expatriates are normally permitted upon de- parture to remit their liquid funds to their country of perma- nent residence. Foreign investments that have been approved under the Law for the Organization of Industry and the Promotion of 2 The equivalent of YD 75 for Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kuwa i t, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Yemen Arab Republic, and the Gulf States. Travelers to the Yemen Arab Republic may a l terna t ive ly take out up to YRls 1,000 in Yemen rials. PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN Industrial Investment (Law No. 23 of May 14, 1971) may be granted exemptions from import du ty and various other tax facilities. All remittances abroad of interest and profits require prior approval by the Director of Exchange Control. Profit remit- tances abroad by foreign firms under Law No. 23 also are subject to the Exchange Control Law (Law No. 16) and in any one year should not normally exceed 50 per cent of the accrued net profit. Beginning five years after production has started, the net value of the enterprise (calculated on the basis of actual or book value or surrender or liquidation value, whichever is less) is transferable at the rate of 25 per cent a year; if an expatriate national or foreign investor encounters difficulties, however, his capital may be retransferred six months after en t ry. Interest due on any loans obtained abroad after the firm concerned has been established may also be remitted, provided that all duties, taxes, and other govern- ment dues have been paid. Gold Only the monetary authorities and authorized dealers may purchase, hold, or sell gold bullion. Licensed goldsmiths may purchase, hold, and sell other unworked gold and gold coins and ornaments. Other residents may hold gold only in the form of ornaments or numismatic coins. Exports and imports of gold by registered goldsmiths require licenses issued by the Ministry of Economy and Industry (General Department for Foreign Trade); in certain cases, the consent of the Foreign Exchange Committee must also be obtained. Travelers may bring in or take out reasonable amounts of gold, in the form of ornaments only (not exceeding YD 250 in value for incom- ing travelers and not exceeding YD 100 for departing travel- ers). Imports and exports of gold by travelers are subject only to customs control, but incoming travelers must sell to an authorized dealer any gold coins or bullion they carry. Changes during 1973 February 16. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, the authorities decided to main- tain the gold content of the currency unchanged. The central rate, previously YD 1 = US$2.60571, became YD 1 = US$2.89524. 485 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution YUGOSLAVIA Exchange Rate System The par value is 0.0433330 gram of f ine gold per Yugoslav Dinar, corresponding to Din 20.508 = SDR 1 or Din 17 = US$1. However, since July 12, 1973 the authorities have not maintained the exchange rate of the dinar within announced margins and therefore all transactions, except for receipts and payments effected under the procedures set fo r th for certain countries with which Yugoslavia has bilateral payments agreements, take place at a f luc tua t ing exchange rate. The buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar in the foreign exchange market in Belgrade on December 31, 1973 were Din 15.58 and Din 15.63 per US$1, respectively. The foreign exchange market is limited to spot transactions between au- thorized business banks and the National Bank of Yugosla- via. The currencies dealt in are Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guil- ders, Norwegian kroner, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. Administration of Control On the basis of laws governing these matters, the Federal Executive Council prescribes the general provisions in respect of foreign trade and exchange transactions. The Federal Sec- retariat for Foreign Trade, by virtue of these general provi- sions, establishes rules and regulations, makes decisions governing commercial transactions, and issues import and export licenses when required. It is also charged w i th securing balanced trade with payments agreement countries. The Fed- eral Secretariat for Finance prescribes the specific provisions governing exchange transactions. This Secretariat and the National Bank of Yugoslavia administer the exchange con- trols. The National Bank prescribes the methods of payment to and from foreign countries; it also licenses compensation transactions. All foreign exchange transactions must be carried out through the National Bank or an authorized bank. The latter are of three types. Fully authorized banks, which must have a minimum credit fund of Din 500 million and deposits of at least Din 1,000 million, may engage in all foreign exchange transactions in Yugoslavia and abroad, as well as in foreign credit operations (including the granting of guarantees). Lim- ited authorized banks, which must have a m in imum credit fund amounting to Din 100 million and deposits of at least Din 200 million, may conduct foreign exchange operations in Yugoslavia only; they may neither keep foreign exchange accounts abroad nor engage in foreign credit operations, ex- cept through the intermediary of a fu l ly authorized credit bank. Authorized exchange offices may only deal in foreign banknotes and travelers checks; this status is open to all commercial and savings banks, hotels, and specifically autho- rized tourist agencies. Commercial exports and imports may be effected by all economic organizations (both producing and trading under- takings) registered for this purpose. Registration is effected automatically, provided that certain conditions, including the 486 provision of m in imum working capital for trade enterprises, are fulfilled. Economic organizations that are not registered to conduct foreign trade channel their orders through eco- nomic organizations which export a n d / or import on their own behalf. Prescription of Currency Payments to and from countries with which Yugoslavia has bilateral payments agreements are made in the currencies and according to the procedures set forth in those agreements. If no agreement exists, settlement is usually made in a convert- ible currency. Yugoslavia has payments agreements requiring settlements through bilateral accounts as follows: (1) in U.S. dollars w i th Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Ghana, Greece, Hun- gary, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, and the U.S.S.R.; (2) in the partner country's currency with Iraq. Certain settlements with Bangladesh, Colombia, Mexico, and Pakistan take place through special accounts. A degree of multilateralization of payments is provided under the bilateral payments agree- ments w i th Afghan is tan, Ghana, Hungary, and Iraq. Nonresident Accounts Foreign juridical and physical persons may maintain ac- counts denominated in foreign exchange and in dinars in Yugoslavia according to the following rules. Foreigners resi- dent outside Yugoslavia may freely open accounts in convert- ible currencies in Yugoslavia. Foreign missions and foreigners resident in Yugoslavia may freely open with authorized banks accounts expressed in foreign currencies or dinars. Foreign exchange accounts in convertible currencies of nonresident juridical and physical persons are kept in the currency deposited. * Balances on these accounts may be used for all payments in Yugoslavia, in dinars or in the currency concerned, and abroad, in any convertible currency. Trans- fers from these accounts are free if made in the currency in which the account is kept; outward transfers in other convert- ible currencies are subject to the account-holding bank being prepared to make the necessary conversion. Nonresident foreign exchange accounts in bilateral curren- cies may be opened only for certain foreign juridical and physical persons resident in Yugoslavia and subject to prior approval by the National Bank. Balances may be used only for dinar payments in Yugoslavia or for retransfer to the bilateral country to which the account is related. Foreign juridical and physical persons may freely open nonresident accounts in convertible dinars with authorized banks. Such accounts can be credited freely w i th amounts whose transfer in convertible currency has been authorized and they may be debited freely for permitted payments in 1 Accounts may be denominated in any of the fo l low ing currencies: Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner, deutsche ma rk, Finnish ma rkkaa, French francs, I ta l ian lire, Japanese yen, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, pounds s ter l ing, Spanish pesetas, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. Other convertible currencies must be converted in to one or more of the foregoing currencies. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution Yugoslavia and for transfer abroad in the convertible cur- rency of the account holder's country of domicile. Nonresident juridical and physical persons may also open other dinar accounts w i th authorized banks. These other ac- counts may be credited with dinars acquired in Yugoslavia in accordance with the existing regulations or subject to the approval of the National Bank of Yugoslavia. Balances are, in principle, nontransferable and may be spent in Yugoslavia only for noncommercial payments by the account holder or by members of his close family, or by the owner and staff of foreign firms if the account holder is a foreign juridical per- son. If balances on these accounts derive from copyright royalties or from work performed in Yugoslavia by foreign- ers, from pensions and disability allowances of persons who have emigrated from Yugoslavia, or from alimony payments, transfers may be effected in accordance with the existing regulations. Resident nationals may maintain foreign exchange ac- counts or foreign exchange savings deposits in convertible currencies with any authorized bank, provided that they orig- inate from receipts specified in the relevant regulations. These accounts are kept in the currency deposited, are interest bear- ing, and interest is paid partly in the foreign currency depos- ited and partly in dinars. Foreign exchange accounts may be retained for an indefinite period of time and may be drawn upon freely for payments in Yugoslavia and abroad on behalf of the account holder or his immediate family; balances are not transferable to other persons or accounts (see section on Proceeds from Invisibles, below). Yugoslav emigrants resid- ing abroad and former emigrants returning to Yugoslavia may also open foreign exchange accounts in Yugoslavia that may be used freely for payments in Yugoslavia or abroad. Foreign exchange accounts in bilateral currencies may be maintained by resident nationals. In the case of currencies of Eastern European countries 2 and Mongolia the accounts are denominated in dollars of account; for other bilateral curren- cies the accounts are kept in the currency deposited. In gen- eral, balances may be used only for dinar payments in Yugoslavia or for retransfers to the bilateral country to which the account is related. Imports and Import Payments Commercial imports may be effected only by economic organizations registered as participating in foreign trade. In addition to economic organizations specializing in foreign trade, most major industrial producers are registered. The import of certain basic foodstuffs, such as wheat, rice, coffee, lard, edible oils, and sugar, is carried out by economic organi- zations that have been selected by the Federal Office for Food Reserves, on the basis of public bids. For most commodities import licenses are not required. All commodities included in the foreign trade nomenclature are classified in five categories, largely in accordance with the manner in which exchange is made available: LB—liberalized goods; DL—goods liberalized under special license; GDK — goods imported under global exchange quotas; RK and DK YUGOSLAVIA —goods subject to individual quotas (RK if individual quo- tas are fixed by quan t i ty and DK if they are fixed in dinars); and D —imports subject to ad hoc licensing. Goods in the LB category are mainly raw materials, food- stuffs, and spare parts, but they also include some consumer goods; at the end of 1973, 4,394 items (out of a total of 7,578) were classified under LB. Protective equipment for workers and all other goods not specifically included in the GDK, RK, DK, or D lists were also liberalized and free from any quantitative restriction. Imports of LB commodities ac- counted for 28.3 per cent of total imports in 1972, and 51.6 per cent of total imports in 1973. Exchange for payments for LB imports from the convertible currency area is made avail- able freely in any convertible currency appropriate to the exporting country. Payments for imports of liberalized goods from payments agreement countries must be made in the manner prescribed in the relevant payments agreement and may be restricted according to the availability of funds in the appropriate clearing account. DL goods comprise certain previously restricted consumer items, such as tape recorders and watches, whose 1972 import value was negligible. Special licenses are required for these items for statistical and recording purposes. The Secretariat for Foreign Trade is obliged to issue the license within 20 days from the date of application. Once the license is obtained the importer may freely acquire foreign exchange for the import payment in the same manner as for LB goods. At the end of 1973, 20 items were liberalized under the DL regime, and imports of these items corresponded in 1973 to 0.3 per cent of total imports. The GDK list comprises raw materials, most capital equip- ment, and most of those consumer goods not liberalized un- der the LB and DL regimes. In 1972 imports of commodities that were on this list amounted to 46 per cent of total imports, and in 1973 imports of the same items amounted to 21.2 per cent of total imports. Such imports can be made under several different procedures. Those for nonconsumer goods are as follows: Each importer of raw materials and other reproduc- tion materials receives a global foreign exchange quota and may use the exchange so allocated to purchase any such goods listed as GDK. For certain imports by the metalwork- ing, shipbuilding, and electrical industries, the authority to use the allocated foreign exchange quota is dependent on the exports that the importers have made (import-export l ink- ing). 3 Major exporters, i.e., exporters whose exports settled in convertible currency account for more than 51 per cent of their total sales proceeds, are permitted to pay freely for imports of raw materials and other reproduction materials for their own needs. Payment for imports of capital goods on the GDK list may be financed from specific exchange allocations; a considerable portion may be freely financed from retention quota funds (see section on Exports and Export Proceeds, below), funds originating in depreciation allowances, and credits obtained abroad, including suppliers' credits. The spe- cific exchange allocations are limited mainly to large invest- ment projects, including public utilities; the amounts are determined by the Federal Assembly. Economic organiza- 2 Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Poland, Romania, and U.S.S.R. 3 The system of export-import l ink ing arrangements was terminated w i th effect from January 1, 1974. 487 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution YUGOSLAVIA tions may acquire foreign exchange at a predetermined pro- portion of their annual depreciation allowance, a ratio that varies according to the economic sector involved. Imports under commodity quotas (list RK or list DK), mainly selected agricultural and mineral products (such as wheat, sugar, rice, coffee, and salt) but also machine tools and certain plastics, are subject to quotas established for each commodity and cannot be imported under any other proce- dure. The quotas are established either in physical quantities (RK) or in dinars (DK). There are separate quotas in each case for imports from convertible area countries and pay- ments agreement countries; their allocation among importers is decided by negotiations among the economic organiza- tions. 4 Imports of RK and DK items amounted to about 21 per cent of total imports in 1972 and about 20.6 per cent of total imports in 1973. Exchange is provided automatically for payments for imports of goods subject to the RK and DK regime, but only up to a predetermined quan t i ty or amount for each item. Goods in list D comprise gunpowder, ammun i t ion, opium, motor vehicles, tractors, certain textile fibers and yarns, tele- vision sets, railroad rolling stock, and aircraft. Import li- censes are required only for list D commodities. These licenses automatically entitle an enterprise to purchase the requisite foreign exchange. Imports of D items accounted for 4.7 per cent of total imports in 1972 and 6.5 per cent of total imports in 1973. For certain goods there is an additional requirement, irre- spective of those set out above, of a special import license ("accordance") issued by the Federal Secretariat for Foreign Trade. At the end of 1973 these goods were 61 LB items, 6 GDK items, 4 RK items, and 2 DK items. For all items concerned, the Secretariat may prescribe direct importation from the country of origin; these items include a wide range of tropical foodstuffs and fruits, raw materials, fats, oils, and textiles, as well as tin and raw cotton. Private persons who are Yugoslav nationals and hold for- eign exchange accounts with Yugoslav banks may use these funds freely to import goods intended for their own use or for the use of close relatives residing with them, regardless of the import regime for the goods. Also, Yugoslavs returning from work abroad and nonresidents residing in Yugoslavia for more than three mon ths may import goods up to Din 50,000 intended for their personal needs or the needs of their own household, provided such goods were paid for from the sav- ings from their foreign earnings; such savings may be held abroad or in foreign exchange accounts w i th Yugoslav banks. As an exception to the foregoing, owners of foreign ex- change accounts and Yugoslav nationals work ing abroad may import automobiles, trucks, motorcycles, mopeds, and bicycles, together w i th mounted motors and essential spare parts for these vehicles, provided that importation is effected through a registered enterprise and payment is made through 4 In principle, any such allocation among importers must be agreed upon among economic organizations w i th in the Federal Economic Chamber. If the importers are unable to agree among themselves, the Federal Secretariat for Foreign Trade is authorized to decide on the d is t r ibu t ion. Imports of coffee, wheat, sugar, rice, and salt for final consumption are administered by the Federal Office for Food Reserves, which is authorized to select the most competitive importer from among registered importers. 488 a foreign exchange account held at a Yugoslav bank. Yugo- slav and foreign nationals are exempt from this prescribed manner of payment and method of importation, however, under the following circumstances: when they return for per- manent residence in Yugoslavia, provided that they have spent at least f ive years abroad; when a vehicle is inherited; when a motor vehicle is purchased out of an insurance indem- n i ty received for a motor vehicle that has been destroyed and had originally been paid for in foreign currency; and if they have spent at least two years abroad continuously and have owned a vehicle for at least two years. Yugoslav citizens returning from a tourist trip abroad may import any amount of goods intended for the needs of their household. However, if the value of the goods exceeds Din 1,000, these goods must be handed over, at the customs office at the point of en try, to a domestic forwarder for deliv- ery to the owner's address; such delivery cannot be made unless the customs duties are paid. Compensation transactions are only authorized in excep- tional circumstances; in both 1972 and 1973 they accounted for less than 1 per cent of total imports. Many agricultural commodities and foodstuffs are subject to variable import levies. A 1 per cent special tax for customs evidence and a 3 per cent equalization tax ("contingency tax") are payable on all commodities not exempt from customs du ty. In addition, an import surcharge of 6 per cent of the c.i.f. value at the border has to be paid for all dutiable com- modities, with the exception that the surcharge has been re- duced to 2 per cent for capital equipment for the development of basic primary product industries, and for certain essential items such as butter, wheat flour, hides, and raw cotton. Payments for Invisibles Payments for invisibles related to merchandise transac- tions, including transportation, are fu l ly liberalized. Ex- change to cover export promotion expenses abroad is made freely available to exporters. Pensions, wages, and salaries are transferable under certain conditions. Payments in respect of royalties and alimony granted by court order are freely trans- ferable, but if a payment is to be made to a country with which Yugoslavia maintains bilateral payments arrange- ments, then such payments may be made only if the agree- ment in question provides for this to be done on a reciprocal basis. Authorized banks may sell foreign currency up to the equivalent of Din 600 for remittances for court and other fees abroad and for specified personal expenses. The National Bank may authorize the sale of any amount of foreign ex- change for the foregoing and for unspecified purposes when justified in light of the circumstances. Purchases of services abroad, as well as spare parts, fuel, etc., by Yugoslav enterprises involved in international freight and passenger transportation are liberalized. There is no basic exchange allowance for tourist travel abroad. However, travel agencies may sell organized tours abroad against payment in dinars up to an amount equivalent to 50 per cent of their individual retention quotas. The Na- tional Bank may also authorize travel agencies to sell foreign exchange for both group and individual travel abroad. Pay- ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ments for other invisibles may be made from the remitter's own foreign exchange funds (e.g., from retention quotas, or, when made by various social and sociopolitical organizations, from specific annual allocations). Not more than Din 500 in domestic currency, in denominations of Din 50 or less, may be taken out by travelers. Foreign travelers may bring in and take out any amount in foreign exchange w i thout de- claring it. Exports and Export Proceeds In principle, exports are free of control, except for certain raw materials that are in short supply on the domestic market (including petroleum and petroleum derivatives and certain livestock) and certain other materials such as gunpowder, weapons, and narcotic drugs. Exports to countries w i th which Yugoslavia has a bilateral payments agreement are subject to approval by the Federal Secretariat for Foreign Trade ("accordance"). Such approval may be given for a group of commodities or for all commodities to be exported w i th in a certain period (global approval). Permission to ex- port to bilateral countries may be made conditional on an under tak ing to import from such countries. In accordance w i th bilateral arrangements, Yugoslavia restrains exports of certain commodities to France, the Federal Republic of Ger- many, Sweden, and the United States. A preferential export regime exists for economic organizations recognized as "major exporters." 5 Proceeds from exports must be repatriated w i th in 90 days from the date of exportation, unless specific approval is granted to deviate from this rule. The surrender of these proceeds is not required. The full export proceeds may be credited to foreign exchange sight deposit accounts which the exporter ma in ta ins with an authorized bank of his choice; separate accounts must be established for each currency. Ex- change on these accounts may either be used, subject to the relevant regulations, for payments for imports and invisibles or be sold to an authorized bank. Retention quotas may be used to pay for imports of certain consumer goods if such imports are made by economic organizations that are in the catering and tourist industries or are engaged in setting up trade fairs, and by film enterprises; such imports are also permitted as consignment stocks. The part of the export proceeds that remains at the free disposal of the exporter for payments abroad is referred to as the retention quota; the remainder may be retained indefi- nitely or used for certain payments abroad, but cannot earn interest. The permitted retention rate is 20 per cent for all export earnings from goods and services, with the exception that rates of 45 per cent and 100 per cent, respectively, apply to foreign exchange earnings of tourist agencies, hotels, etc., and to receipts of Yugoslav enterprises operating abroad. In some instances (services rendered to foreign tourists and sales of newly mined gold to the National Bank), sales against payment in dinars are regarded as exports for retention quota purposes. Producing enterprises selling specified consumer 5 The concept of "major exporters" was abolished with effect from Janu- ary 1, 1974. YUGOSLAVIA goods in Yugoslavia for foreign currency may retain 20 per cent of the foreign exchange thus earned. Proceeds from Invisibles Proceeds from invisibles must be repatriated within 60 days from the date on which the claim is payable, except that profits earned in foreign exchange by Yugoslav organizations from construction activities abroad must be repatriated w i th in 90 days following the date of completion of the project. The performance of construction and engineering services in payments agreement countries is subject to an "accordance" issued by the Federal Secretariat for Foreign Trade. Receipts from services are eligible for retention quo- tas. Exchange proceeds may be used for payments abroad connected with the activities of the economic organization concerned, including payments for purchases of equipment and other material for its own needs. The retained exchange is not transferable to economic organizations other than those with which the recipients are cooperating in technical and business matters, but it can always be sold to authorized banks. If the exchange is used to pay for imports, the usual import procedures apply. Residents who, while employed abroad, deposited their savings in foreign savings banks and obtained a "savings book," may withdraw their balances in the form of foreign exchange when in Yugoslavia. Residents may hold interest-bearing foreign currency ac- counts in Yugoslavia. The accounts may be credited with the fu ll amount of a person's savings from per diem allowances, salaries, and other earnings abroad, and from fellowships, royalties, and inheritances. They may also be credited with 50 per cent of the amount of foreign exchange accruing from pensions, disability allowances, alimony, and grants received from abroad, and w i th the full amount of foreign exchange accruing from indemnities and insurance. These accounts may be used freely for the personal needs of the account holder and of close members of his family; they are not trans- ferable to other persons or accounts and may be retained for an indefinite period of time. Authorized trade organizations may sell manufactured goods to foreign tourists in Yugoslavia against payment in foreign exchange at a discount of 10 per cent, representing the exemption from turnover taxes. This discount is granted only on purchases in authorized shops' against checks expressed in foreign currencies or against certain foreign banknotes. Not more than Din 500 in Yugoslav banknotes, in denomi- nations of Din 50 or less, may be brought in by travelers. Capital Foreign loans and credits may be freely contracted by fully authorized banks and economic organizations, with the ex- ceptions that no consumer goods may be imported on de- ferred payment terms, and that no foreign financial credits may be taken up whose repayment terms include a grace period of less than two years. All other inward or outward transfers of a capital nature by residents or nonresidents re- quire individual licenses.

For financial credits and foreign exchange deposits received by business banks for the account of nonresidents, the f ive basic rates of deposit in tro- duced in April 1972 range from 1 per cent for maturities over ten years to 40 per cent for maturities of less than two years. However, as a temporary measure beginning in mid-Decem- ber 1972, a dinar deposit requirement of 75 per cent was required for all financial credits and foreign exchange depos- its by nonresidents regardless of ma tu r i ty. For credits for importation of capital goods, the deposit rates at the end of 1973 were 20 per cent for credits w i th a ma tu r i ty up to two years; 10 per cent for credits between three and five years; and 1 per cent for credits w i th a ma tur i ty over five years. How- ever, if the capital goods were imported for investments in underdeveloped regions of Yugoslavia, the latter deposit rates were 10 per cent for credits w i th a ma tu r i ty up to three years and 1 per cent for credits with a ma tu r i ty in excess of three years. For foreign credits of any k ind guaranteed by Yugoslav commercial banks, a dinar deposit of 5 per cent was required which yielded no interest and was held to ma tu r i ty of the loan. Certain foreign credits are specifically exempted from the foregoing deposit requirements; these include credits from specified international financial organizations, credits con- tracted for or on behalf of the Federal Government or the National Bank of Yugoslavia, and credits contracted for the importation of equipment intended for high-priority sectors and activities as defined by Decisions of the Federal Execu- tive Council. Foreign credits repayable with foreign exchange acquired according to the regulations governing the foreign trade re- gime are trade credits for raw materials and intermediate goods, usually w i th a ma tu r i ty of up to 360 days; counterpart payments in dinars must be made according to National Bank regulations in force at the time. At the end of 1973, the requirement was a 66 per cent downpayment, w i th the re- ma in ing 34 per cent payable 30 days before final ma tu r i ty of the credit. Exceptions were (1) that for imports of raw materi- als subject to import quotas (RK) and imports of capital goods and equipment to be incorporated into projects and ships under export contracts, a deposit of 100 per cent must be made 30 days prior to repayment of the credit; and (2) that certain basic raw materials (such as crude oil, wool, and raw cotton) were exempt from dinar counterpart requirements. Foreigners may invest in certain Yugoslav economic orga- nizations but only through joint ventures; such foreign invest- ment is limited to 49 per cent of the organization's capital. Profit transfers abroad may be financed from the retention quota and, in addition, profit transfers are permitted up to one third of the jo int venture's foreign currency earnings from exports of goods and services. If the law governing joint 490 ventures were to be amended, the legal provisions in force on the date of registration of a jo int venture would continue to be applied dur ing the entire l ife of the investment contract, if the foreign investor so desires or, at the latter's option, any more favorable provisions of the amended legislation would be applied. Foreign firms are permitted to establish represen- tational offices in Yugoslavia. Foreign juridical and physical persons are permitted to purchase bonds issued by Yugoslav enterprises, sociopolitical communities, and other sociolegal persons. The investment income earned abroad by Yugoslav eco- nomic organizations must be repatriated within 90 days; how- ever, when repatriated the profits are governed by the regulations for retention quotas. Residents are obliged to repatriate and, w i th the exception of inheritances, to surren- der all foreign exchange held or accruing abroad on capital account. Outward capital transfers by residents who are physical persons are not approved. Economic organizations wishing to participate in foreign enterprises may be allowed under spe- cial conditions, by the Federal Secretariat for Foreign Trade and the Federal Secretariat for Finance, to export the neces- sary capital. Also, a Decision of the Federal Executive Coun- cil of October 14, 1955 requires the Yugoslav authorities to continue to permit the remittance of inheritances to citizens of the United States, provided that the remittance is requested w i th in three years from the date of distribution of the estate. Gold The National Bank has issued certain commemorative gold coins, which are not legal tender. Foreign travelers are freely permitted to import and export these coins, subject to cus- toms declaration and, for exports, subject to proof that they have been purchased in Yugoslavia. Residents who are pri- vate persons may hold gold coins in Yugoslavia, which may be sold to the National Bank of Yugoslavia or to any autho- rized bank, and they may freely hold, purchase, import, and sell gold jewelry and other articles of gold. Domestic economic organizations that have been regis- tered as trad ing in gold may import gold jewelry under the GDK import regime; they may freely export gold jewelry and other articles of gold. Authorized banks may freely export gold coins. Sales of newly mined gold to the National Bank of Yugoslavia against payment in dinars (calculated by apply- ing the rate of Din 17 per U.S. dollar to a price of US$42.22 an ounce) are regarded as exports and entitle the seller to a retention quota of 20 per cent in convertible foreign exchange. Other domestic sales of newly mined gold by the producers may be made at a price which equals the average quotation in free gold markets abroad. Domestic economic organiza- tions using gold for their normal activities may purchase gold from domestic producers or abroad on the basis of quotas allocated to each individually.

Following the termination on December 31, 1972 of the bilateral payments agreements w i th Hunga ry and India, settlements w i th these countries henceforth took place in convertible currencies. January 1. A new import category was established —goods liberalized under special license (DL). It comprised a few GDK, RK, or DK items such as tape recorders and watches, that previously were severely restricted. January L The rates established for allocations of foreign exchange to enterprises in respect of their annual depreciation allowances were modified; the applicable rates for enterprises in many lines of activities were increased. January L Items corresponding to 15.3 per cent of total 1972 imports were transferred from the restricted import lists (mostly GDK) to the liberalized import list (LB), raising the proportion of liberalized goods from 28.3 per cent to 43.6 per cent of total imports. January L The procedure for allocation of foreign ex- change for imports subject to license (List D) was modified so that an import license automatically entitled the importer to purchase the requisite foreign exchange. The advance de- posit requirements were abolished. January L A retention quota was introduced for Yugoslav trade enterprises selling goods w i th in Yugoslavia for foreign exchange to nonresident foreigners and to Yugoslavs tempo- rarily employed abroad. January L New procedures were adopted which provided that exchange would automatically be made available for importation of items subject to commodity quotas (DK List), up to the amount of the individual quotas established for each enterprise. January L The 6 per cent import surcharge was extended un t il December 31, 1973. (At the end of 1973 it was extended for another year.) January L The regulation was revoked which had pre- scribed that banks could not make outward transfers in ex- cess of US$5,000 until 30 days after receipt of the payments order. January 7. The period within which export proceeds must be repatriated was extended from 60 days to 90 days after exportation. January 16. A National Bank Decision was taken to the effect that all exports with a 90-day payment period were to be regarded as exports to be paid in cash. As a result, redis- counting facilities for export claims were improved. February 9. A global foreign exchange quota for 1973 was established for imports of raw materials and intermediate goods for enterprises engaged in research and development activities. February 9. Exports of goods to, and construction and engineering work in, countries with which Yugoslavia has bilateral payments agreements were made subject to export "accordances." YUGOSLAVIA February 9. New regulations were issued governing com- pensation transactions. February 9. A global exchange quota was announced for imports of spare parts by Yugoslav enterprises representing foreign firms. February 15. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Yugoslavia communicated to the International Monetary Fund a rate of Din 17 = US$1, which was to serve as a central rate un t il such time as the Fund concurred in the establishment of that rate as a new par value. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar remained unchanged. February 15. A new Ordinance regarding Long-Term Pro- ductive Cooperation was issued. It came in to force on Febru- ary 23. February 16. Criteria were established for the utilization by Yugoslav enterprises of foreign exchange earned from their construction and engineering activities abroad. February 22. Regulations governing the operation of the proposed foreign exchange market were issued (see May 8, below). February 23. The par value was changed from 0.0481478 gram to 0.0433330 gram of f ine gold per Yugoslav dinar; Yugoslavia continued to avail itself of wider margins. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar remained un- changed at Din 17 = US$1. February 27. Import duties on about 1,000 industrial tariff items were suspended or reduced, w i th retroactive effect from January 1, 1973. March 2. Regulations governing the establishment of busi- nesses abroad were issued. March 2. A global exchange quota was established for the importation of raw materials and intermediate goods by craft organizations. March 2. Procedures were established for determining the amount and distribution of goods subject to quota (DK and RK lists) in 1973. March 16. The conditions that commercial banks must fu l f i ll in order to be authorized to conduct foreign exchange transactions were modified; the concept of "foreign exchange credit fund" was abolished. March 23. Conditions were imposed for the importation of synthetic rubber and plastics. March 30. A global foreign exchange quota of Din 17 million was established for the importation in 1973 of agricul- tural machinery for the production of sugar beets. April 6.

Not for Redistribution ZAIRE Exchange Rate System The par value is 1.77734 grams of fine gold per Zaire, corresponding to Z 0.5 = SDR 1. A central rate of Z 1 = US$2, corresponding to Z 0.603176 = SDR 1, has been established, and Zaire avails itself of wider margins. The intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. The Bank of Zaire (the central bank) quotes an official rate of exchange for the Belgian franc based on the rate for the zaire quoted on the official exchange market in Brussels. The buying and selling rates for other quoted currencies, except the U.S. dollar, the French franc, and the CFA franc, also are based on official market rates in Brussels. For the U.S. dollar, the Bank of Zaire quotes a fixed rate of Z 1 = US$2, buying and selling. Quotations for the French franc and the CFA franc are based on daily quotations for the zai're in the official exchange mar- ket in Paris. Forward exchange transactions are prohibited. Administration of Control The Bank of Zaire has regulatory authority over all foreign trade and payments. Specifically, the Bank has discretionary power to authorize payments and receipts in foreign exchange by residents of Zaire, and to permit the importation, exporta- tion, and transit of goods. Prescription of Currency Payments from nonresidents must be received in listed con- vertible currencies quoted daily by the Bank of Zaire. * Spe- cial authorization for the acceptance of other currency may only be given in respect of currencies that can be exchanged freely without a discount. Payments to nonresidents must be made in the listed currencies. However, certain settlements with Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda are made through spe- cial accounts. Nonresident Accounts There are three categories of nonresident accounts: Non- resident Accounts in Zaires, Nonresident Foreign Currency Accounts, and Convertible Accounts in Zaires. Nonresident Accounts in Zaires may only be debited with the approval of the Bank of Zaire. Such accounts, when opened by diplomatic missions and international organiza- tions established in Zaire, may be debited freely but may be credited only with the proceeds of sales of foreign currency and with payments made by the Government. Nonresident Foreign Currency Accounts may be credited for any permitted payment in foreign currency; they may be debited freely for transfers to accounts abroad or to Resident and Nonresident Foreign Currency Accounts, and for sales of foreign currency against domestic currency. Nonresident Zairian nationals require special authorization from the cen- 1 Austrian schillings, Belgian francs, Canadian dollars, CFA francs, Danish kroner, deutsche mark, French francs, Italian lire, Netherlands guilders, Norwegian kroner, Portuguese escudos, pounds sterling, Swedish kroner, Swiss francs, and U.S. dollars. tral bank to open these accounts with authorized banks; non- resident foreigners may open them freely. Convertible Accounts in Zaires may be credited in accor- dance with Circular No. 131 2 and debited freely for conver- sion into foreign currency or for any payments in domestic currency. Such accounts may be held by residents and nonres- idents but must not be credited with payments for exports of goods or services. Imports and Import Payments The importation of a number of goods is prohibited on grounds of public policy; these are mainly arms, ammunition, narcotics, and juke boxes. Import licenses, which must be submitted to the Bank of Zaire for prior approval, are only required for a few goods on list A (these include jewelry, precious stones, precious metals, gold coins, rubber tires, sugar, portland cement, mineral water, works of art, and antiques). The central bank has issued a general import and payments license which for all other goods guarantees the availability of foreign exchange when payments fall due, pro- vided that the importer files an import declaration with his bank following the actual placing of the order and provided that invoice price and quality have been verified and found acceptable by the foreign correspondents of the Zairian Con- trol Office. Applications for import licenses, whether requiring foreign exchange or not, are made out at authorized banks; these forward the applications to the central bank after certifica- tion. After approval of the application by the central bank, which is given in the form of a visa, the import license applica- tion is returned to the intermediary authorized bank for vali- dation. Import licenses are validated by the authorized banks with- out undue delay and remain valid for customs clearance for six months starting from the first day of the month following that in which validation by the commercial bank takes place. Foreign exchange is made available for all licensed imports, the validated license constituting at the same time an ex- change license; for payments purposes, the license remains valid as long as the relevant payments have not been com- pleted. The counterpart of the value of goods imported under the Belgian food aid program, the U.S. import support pro- gram, and the agricultural aid program must be deposited within 120 to 180 days after their shipment. All imports are subject to a statistical tax of 3 per cent ad valorem. In addition, most imports, irrespective of origin, are subject to a temporary import surcharge of either 5 per cent or 20 per cent ad valorem on the c.i.f. value. Payments for Invisibles Policy related to payments for invisibles is formulated by the central bank. Certain payments are subject to authoriza- tion by the central bank, which is given or refused on a 2 Conversion of foreign currency at the official rate, transfer from another Convertible Account in Zaires, or authorized payments by residents to nonresidents. 493 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ZAIRE nondiscriminatory basis; the approval au thor i ty for other current payments has been delegated to the authorized banks. The central bank will not authorize exchange for the payment of commissions in favor of shippers or purchasing agents or, except for imports payable on arrival, and provided that the supplier has arranged it, for insurance on imports. Further- more, imports and exports between Zaire and ports in Bel- gium, Germany, the Netherlands, and the Scandinavian countries must be shipped in vessels participating in the con- ference of the Associated Central West Africa Lines. Banks are not authorized to pay in foreign currency the maritime freight on shipments that do not meet these regulations, un- less an immediate discount is obtained on the invoice, and in the case of exports, banks are not authorized to validate export declarations unless these are marked accordingly. All other payments for services performed by nonresidents are in principle authorized. Transfers abroad of salaries of foreign nationals, however, are restricted; for each enterprise con- cerned, their amount cannot exceed the countervalue in zai'res of the amount spent on such transfers in 1972. Transfers in respect of certain administrative expenses abroad by enter- prises, interest on private loans, and certain portions of insur- ance premiums are, as a rule, authorized. Net profits of firms w i th foreign capital participation are transferable up to an amount proportionate to that participation. Transfers of roy- alties require the prior approval of the Service de la Pro- priete Industrielle. Fares for travel abroad may be paid in Zaire in local cur- rency. Zai'rian nationals traveling abroad may buy foreign exchange in amounts depending on the duration of the jour- ney, up to the equivalent of Z 400 a trip; applications exceed- ing this amount are subject to individual approval by the central bank. The export of domestic banknotes and coins is prohibited. Nonresident travelers may take out any foreign means of payment declared upon en try, minus the equivalent, at the official rate, of Z 20 for each day spent in Za'ire. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports not covered by general license require individ- ual declarations. Banks are normally authorized to approve such declarations, in which exporters undertake to collect the exchange proceeds. The declaration must specify the na ture of the merchandise to be exported, the price, and the currency in which payment is to be received. Export declarations are normally valid for three months; within this period, the pro- ceeds must be received and surrendered. Most exports of minerals are subject to special regulations to take in to ac- count the time required for processing abroad. For mineral products exported by the Generate des Carrieres et Mines du Zaire (GECAMINES), a provisional payment of a variable por- tion of the shipment's estimated value has to be received and surrendered within 8 days after shipment. For diamond ex- ports, two thirds of the value established at a preliminary examination in Zaire must be surrendered before the ship- ment is dispatched. Export proceeds from coffee must be surrendered w i th in 45 days after shipment. Receipts from other agricultural exports must generally be repatriated 494 within three months of validation. The exportation of coffee is a monopoly of the National Coffee Office. Minimum export prices have been established for coffee, tea, ivory, and certain other commodities. All exports are subject to a statistical tax of 1 per cent ad valorem, and all commodities except cement are subject to export duties. Proceeds from Invisibles All exchange receipts from invisibles must be surrendered. The import of domestic banknotes and coins is prohibited. Nonresident travelers may bring in any amount in foreign means of payment and may take out on departure the amount declared on entry, less the equivalent of Z 20 a calendar day spent in Zaire. Capital The repatriation of new foreign capital brought in under the provisions of the Investment Code (Ordinance-Law No. 69-032 of June 26, 1969) is guaranteed, as is the transfer of prof i ts and dividends on such capital. With minor exceptions, other transfers abroad of capital owned by residents or non- residents are not permitted. Gratuitous transfers of real estate are subject to approval by executive ordinance. When the local currency part is paid by the debtor, amortization on foreign loans can be transferred in accordance with the terms of contracts that the central bank has endorsed to guarantee the availability of exchange for such transfers. The foreign currency assets of the authorized banks are not permitted to exceed their short-term liabilities in foreign currencies. Gold Residents other than the monetary authorities, producers of gold, and industrial users are not allowed to purchase, hold, or sell gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. The import and export of gold in any form, except jewelry constituting the personal effects of a traveler, require the prior approval of the central bank. Producers are required to sell 10 per cent of their production to the central bank at the official gold price. Changes during 1973 January 1. Transfers of salaries by expatriate employees, limited since 1971 to 50 per cent of net salaries after tax, were limited, for each enterprise, to the amount of the countervalue in za'ires spent on such transfers in 1972. January 5. Law No. 73-009 reserved import and export operations, transport business, and wholesale and retail trade for Zai'rian nationals and for companies registered in Zaire whose entire capital was held by Zai'rian citizens. Cer- tain exemptions could, however, be granted. February 1. Law No. 73-006 of January 5 increased import duties on many commodities. It also raised the rate of the temporary import surcharge from 5 per cent to 20 per cent for specified luxury goods, and exempted specified textile products and some other items from this tax. ©International Monetary Fund.

It was announced that all plantations, agri- cultural enterprises, stone quarries, and diamond m in ing en- terprises would have to be transferred to Zai'rian ownership. State participation in the m in ing sector would be expanded. All transport insurance on exports had to be placed with the national insurance company, the Societe Nationale d'Assu- rance (SONAS). The Compagnie Maritime du Zaire would be dissolved and replaced by a new company, La Compagnie Maritime Zai'roise, which would be given a monopoly over all export shipping and over the transportation of government imports. The Zairianization of domestic and foreign trade would be accelerated. (It was subsequently clarified that the Zairianization measures would not affect recent or f u t u re foreign investments in the coun try .) 495 ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution ZAMBIA Exchange Rate System The par value is 1.14592 grams of f ine gold per Zambian Kwacha, corresponding to K 1 = SDR 1.28948, and Zambia avails itself of wider margins. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is K 1 = US$1.55556 or US$1 = K 0.642856. The Bank of Zambia maintains fixed buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar. These rates are V ie of 1 per cent below parity for buying (US$1 = K 0.64246) and presentation of the relevant documents to an authorized bank. Prior approval by the Bank of Zambia, however, is necessary for payments to Rhodesia and South Africa in excess of K 20,000; payments for imports from Rhodesia and South Africa are not normally permitted unless no alternative source of supply is available. Unless prior permission is other- wise obtained, all imports must be paid for within six months of the date of importation. All dutiable imports are subject to a customs surcharge of 10 per cent ad valorem. Payments for Invisibles Exchange to pay for invisibles related to imports, and also, up to certain limits, for other purposes, such as travel, is provided by the commercial banks without prior reference to the exchange control authorities, except when payments and transfers in excess of K 20,000 to Rhodesia or South Africa are involved. Special reduced allocations apply to payments for invisibles to Rhodesia. For other countries, exchange is granted as follows. The basic exchange allowance for travel is K 20 a day for an adult, with a maximum of K 600 for each period of two calendar years, and K 10 a day for each child under 12 years of age, with a maximum of K 300 for two calendar years. Exchange is provided, subject to certain lim- its, for other purposes such as education, medical treatment, and business travel. Applications for amounts exceeding the limits may in certain circumstances be granted by the ex- change control authorities if they are satisfied that excep- tional treatment is justified. Applications for remittance abroad of part or all of pay- ments for advertising, management, accounting, administra- tive, engineering, and consulting services rendered to residents by nonresidents are subject to individual approval by the Bank of Zambia, which generally grants the required permission, provided that the fees charged are reasonable and that these services cannot be provided domestically.2 Profits and dividends of subsidiaries and branches of companies whose head offices are situated outside Zambia may be trans- ferred abroad up to 30 per cent of the nonresident share of the equity capital or one half of net profits accruing to the nonresident owners of incorporated companies, whichever is smaller. 3 Foreign companies operating in Zambia may remit declared profits and dividends once a year after the end of the accounting year. The remittance of depreciation allowances is not permitted. Remittances of rents to nonresidents are re- stricted to 50 per cent of net annual rental income. Foreign nationals employed in Zambia on a contract basis and re- cruited after December 4, 1971 are allowed to remit to their country of domicile a third of their annual earnings. Foreign nationals recruited before December 4, 1971 and still em- ployed on a contract entered into prior to that date are al- lowed to remit to their country of domicile one half of their annual earnings. Foreign nationals availing themselves of these arrangements are not entitled to the regular allowances 2 Services rendered by a parent company abroad to its branch or wholly owned subsidiary in Zambia are not generally approved. 3 An auditor's certificate must be submitted to the effect that the amount sought to be transferred represents bona fide realized profits derived from the year's operations after full provision has been made for local taxation. The profit and loss account and balance sheet for the year in respect of which application is being made must also be submitted. ZAMBIA for travel, education, maintenance, etc. To facilitate payments of small amounts, individuals are freely permitted to remit abroad up to K 10 a month for purposes normally approved by the exchange control authorities (including family mainte- nance). Travelers may not take out more than K 10 in Zambian currency and the equivalent of K 20 in foreign currency notes. Exports and Export Proceeds All exports valued at over K 50 require a license; minerals, however, are exported under general agreements with the mining companies. Most exports to Rhodesia are prohibited. Certain commodities are subject to licensing mainly to ensure domestic supplies of needed goods and of certain strategic materials, such as implements of war, lead in any form, cer- tain minerals, petroleum products, certain rough and uncut precious stones, scrap and old metals, and ju te bags. For most goods, however, export licenses are issued freely, and some goods are covered by an open general license. Export proceeds in foreign currency appropriate to the country of destination must be offered for sale to an authorized bank within six months of the date of shipment; the foreign ex- change proceeds of copper exports, however, must be credited to a Bank of Zambia account in London upon receipt. Proceeds from Invisibles Receipts from invisibles in any currency must be offered for sale to an authorized bank. There is no limitation on the amount of foreign currency notes that may be imported by travelers, except that travelers from Zaire are allowed to im- port only up to the equivalent of K 20. The import of Zam- bian currency is limited to K 10 for each traveler, except travelers from Zaire, who are allowed up to K 20. Capital Inward transfers of capital are not restricted but all bor- rowing outside Zambia requires the approval of the exchange control authorities. Outward transfers of capital are con- trolled, but nonresidents are normally permitted to repatriate their investments when they have satisfied the authorities that the original investment was made with funds brought into the country from sources outside Zambia. Local borrowing by companies controlled either directly or indirectly from out- side Zambia is restricted to a debt/equity ratio of 1 to 2. However, the Bank of Zambia permits borrowings in excess of this limit for certain priority sectors of the economy, pro- vided the borrowings secure higher employment opportuni- ties and /or savings of foreign exchange. In general, residents are not permitted to transfer capital abroad and, with certain exceptions, are required to offer for sale to an authorized bank any foreign exchange which ac- crues to them. As a special measure, however, residents may purchase Zambian securities quoted on recognized stock ex- changes abroad, provided that the securities so acquired are registered in the names of specified nominees and that in the event of subsequent disposal of these securities the sales pro- 497 ©International Monetary Fund.

Emigrants are granted exchange as follows: (1) Persons 50 years of age and over are allowed K 8,000 on departure, and subsequent annual transfers of K 5,000. (2) Married persons under 50 are allowed K 4,000 on departure, together with K 250 for each child, up to a maximum of K 5,000 for a family un i t. Thereafter, annual transfers of K 3,000, together with K 250 for each child, up to a maximum of K 4,000 for a family unit are permitted. (3) Unmarried persons under 50 are al- lowed K 2,000 on departure, and subsequent annual transfers of K 1,500. In addition to their emigration allowance, emi- grants may remit gratuities, compensation payments, and terminal benefits up to a maximum of K 8,000 on departure, and up to K 5,000 as annual transfers. Gold Residents may hold and acquire gold coins in Zambia for numismatic purposes. With this exception, residents other than the monetary authorities and authorized industrial users are not allowed to hold or acquire gold in any form other than jewelry, at home or abroad. Imports and exports of gold in any form other than jewelry require exchange control ap- proval as well as import or export licenses issued by the Minister of Trade and Industry; such licenses are not nor- mally granted except for imports and exports by or on behalf of the monetary authorities and industrial users. Gold-bear- ing slime is exported by copper companies as a by-product for refining and sale abroad. Foreign exchange for imports of gold may only be provided with the permission of the Bank of Zambia. Changes during 1973 January 10. Following the announcement that Rhodesia was closing the border with Zambia, all imports and exports via Rhodesia were suspended. January 12. All payments and transfers to Rhodesia, South Africa, Mozambique, and Angola required the prior approval of the Bank of Zambia. Approval was given to all bona fide transactions after screening to prevent illegal capital f l ight and to prevent payments for imports being made before the arrival of goods. Previously, certain payments to these countries, such as payments for imports and freight and in- surance, could be made by the authorized dealers w i thout reference to the Bank of Zambia. January 12. In order to prevent unauthorized payments and transfers to Rhodesia, South Africa, Mozambique, and Angola via third countries, all payments and transfers in excess of K 20,000 to other countries also required the prior approval of the Bank of Zambia. Approval was given after scrutiny of the authenticity of the transaction. January 25. The Bank of Zambia terminated the prior approval requirement for exchange transactions w i th Mo- zambique and Angola, provided the transactions were for K 20,000 or less. The Bank of Zambia also allowed autho- rized dealers to make payments and remittances for pensions, maintenance of relatives, and repatriation of earnings to resi- dents of Rhodesia and South Africa w i thout prior reference 498 to the exchange control authorities, provided applications had been made prior to January 10, 1973. Approval was given liberally to such remittances requested after January 11,1973. January 27. The import surcharge applicable to all dutiable imports was increased from 5 per cent to 10 per cent ad valorem. February 2. The Open General License, which covered im- ports of personal effects, diplomatic shipments, samples, min- ing necessities, parcel post, air freighted goods, and government stores, was revoked. At the same time a list of goods exempt from individual licensing was announced; it covered personal effects, samples, diplomatic shipments, and transport vehicles entering Zambia temporarily. Residents had previously been allowed to import without an individual license any goods, the value of which did not exceed K 25 once a mon th; this facility was now limited to goods for personal use and consumption, provided their value did not exceed K 50 once every 90 days. February 8. A new import control system was introduced, covering all imports except the exempted items listed under February 2, above. It replaced the mon th ly quota system. All public and private sector imports became subject to foreign exchange allocations established by the Ministry of Trade and Indus t ry at the beginning of each quarter. (Under the previous import licensing system, the mon th ly guideline did not affect government imports, imports of the m in ing compa- nies, or imports from the People's Republic of China.) In addition to the Ministry of Trade and Indus try, eight desig- nated agencies were authorized to process initial applications for foreign exchange. February 9. The Bank of Zambia notified authorized deal- ers that it would again consider approval for payments for imports from South Africa before arrival of the goods. February 12. The Ministry of Trade and Indus try pub- lished a list of ten passenger car models which could be imported in to Zambia. In order to conserve foreign exchange and enable proper servicing, no other models would be li- censed. February 15. Following the announcement that the U.S. dollar was being devalued, Zambia maintained the gold value of its currency. The effective parity relationship for the U.S. dollar, previously K 1 = US$1.40, became K 1 = US$1.55556. Zambia continued to avail itself of wider mar- gins. February 19. The import prohibition imposed on 11 com- modities on January 24, 1972 was removed. The remaining prohibition on the import of four types of agricultural com- modities was removed on August 17. March 21. The restriction imposed on January 10, 1972 on local borrowing by companies controlled from outside Zam- bia was eased. The Bank of Zambia announced that it would permit borrowings in excess of a deb t /equ i ty ratio of 1 to 2 for certain priority sectors, provided the borrowings secured higher employment opportunities a n d / or savings of foreign exchange. April 24. The scope of the January 12 measures (see above) was fu r ther reduced to cover only payments and transfers to Rhodesia and South Africa in excess of K 20,000. ©International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution August 31. All payments in foreign exchange by or on behalf of the two major mining companies became subject to prior exchange control approval. Previously, most of their foreign exchange transactions, including remittances of prof- its, dividends, and rents, did not require such approval. The existing restrictions on remittances of profits, dividends, and rents would be applicable also to these m in ing companies, September 12. The restrictions on remittances of profits, dividends, and rents were extended for another year. ZAMBIA 499 ©International Monetary Fund.
